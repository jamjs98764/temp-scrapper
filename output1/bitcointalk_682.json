There are too many egos, and ulterior motives involved for a strong Bitcoin to emerge on the other side.\nDoesn't matter.\nIf anyone stands in the way of honey badger, honey badger just eats through their torso and out the other side. In other words, if it became clear to the larger community of investors, infrastructure owners, and luminaries that some of the devs were obstructing changes for political or other irrelevant reasons, someone in the community - maybe Gavin, maybe anyone - will create a fork with the required changes and after deliberation and testing the vast majority would adopt it.\nPersonalities cannot stop Bitcoin. If they try, they just get left behind coding for a worthless fork. Investors are who is\nin control\n.\nOr look at it this way, in what other system in the world do people debate so carefully and thoroughly, so far in advance, about such relatively minor changes that hypothetically\nmight\ncause a temporary issue? The answer is, only in the most important, civilization-wide mission-critical systems. This should tell you how big of a thing Bitcoin is. This level of debate shows the world we're very serious and are thinking through every nook and cranny of possibility to ensure that this baby grows up to take on the world.\nDon't confuse vigorous debate, posturing, and alarmism for gridlock. These things are inevitable because of how much money is on the line. Gavin already agreed to a smaller increase like Peter Todd wanted and to Jeff Garzik's proposal. Consensus is not far away, and a little nudge from full blocks and some pain of backlog will be all that is needed to push through a modest increase, after which the precedent will have been set against the radical \"1MB forever\" people, so that will be out of the way, and also we'll have better data to argue from. For example, if the new block space soon fills up with spam, we'll know we need to optimize via fees instead next time, and if node count doesn't go down much and large miners don't trample smaller miners then the centralization argument sputters out.\n", "author": "Zangelbert Bingledack Legendary Offline Activity: 1036 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-06-15 13:16:12", "content": "...\nInstead, each blockchain would act like its own cryptocurrency, and you'd have to check with each merchant (or any individual) before you sent them anything to find out which bitcoin they are using.  In that situation, many merchants might choose to accept transactions on both blockchains until one chain reaches an economic superiority.\nThat is very nice.

Billions of dollars going directly to the Libyan central bank, and then to Islamists?\nFor what? So the price of a gallon of gas at the pumps is 30 cents cheaper. Now that, my friend, is something to be outraged over before being upset by some fools who misguidedly donate a few satoshi.\nI'm not mad at Bitcoin at all. I'm very pro BTC. What I don't like is people abusing the freedom it offers for certain purposes.\nThis isn't a case of someone who accidentally tried to tip ISIS. The fact that whatever point he was trying to make shouldn't have been made with involving a terrorist organisation such as ISIS.\nI didnt say accidentally. I said 'Misguidedly'.\nI agree, but freedom cannot be conditional. You are either free to choose, or you are not. In an ideal world, there would be no ISIS to choose, but that is the reality we have engineered by doing business with them.\nBut at least his actions have opened up this debate, which is a good thing.\n", "author": "sAt0sHiFanClub Hero Member Offline Activity: 518 Merit: 500 Warning: Confrmed Gavinista "}, {"date": "2015-03-09 12:14:59", "content": "http://www.coindesk.com/changetip-user-banned-isis/\nNot sure what to make of this.\nI understand the point he was making (see coin desk article) but think that what he did or attempted to do does not justify it.\nBTC has a mixed picture in the outside world.

It's common for people involved in cryptocurrency to disapprove of many of the responses to jihad. They often complain about the invasion of privacy and loss of liberty. I agree with all of this. However, many people seem to have a problem believing that it's possible to disapprove of these responses while at the same time believing jihad is a very real and very serious problem. People new to the community probably pick up on these cues and see it's popular to complain about the response to jihad and that it's unpopular to say jihad is real. This naturally leads some people to say jihad isn't real -- that \"jihadi\" violence is all just a response to how terrible \"we\" are. I've heard Bryce Weiner (and other people in crypto I could name) make excuses for jihadis along these lines. I don't remember exactly what he said, just that I stopped the video right after he said it and thought, \"What a goddamn idiot.\" The only video I'll watch of him in the future is if he's being beheaded by jihadis.\nSo I'm not surprised at all that Weiner felt comfortable donating to ISIS. He probably considers them \"freedom fighters\" against the real bad guys in the world. I am pleasantly surprised there hasn't been more support for ISIS in this thread.\nWhile I'm not a big fan of Christianity, the infamous Luke Jr. may have done Bitcoin a big favor by writing Catholic prayers into the Bitcoin blockchain. People should spread the word that it's in there. If Bitcoin were to be declared\nharam\n, jihadis could move on to a\nhalal\naltcoin.\nI support terrorism every time I pay taxes\nThen you should do one of two things:\n1) Vote to change the government you live under to not be the \"terrorists\" you think they are, or\n2) Move to a place where the government is one that you don't deem as \"terrorists\"\nIn most societies, taxes paid are due to the fact that the citizens have voted to pay those taxes. If you don't agree with those taxes do something to organize your citizens to vote the taxes away or don't live in that jurisdiction.\nWhy do people feel they are so helpless?\nOption 2 is good for most people in the world (including Canadians like me), but from what I've read it doesn't apply to Americans. The U.S. government still demands taxes from its citizens if they move away. They also demand huge \"exit taxes\" to give up citizenship. (Read about Roger Ver's case.) Basically, if you're an American and you don't want to pay taxes to support lots of very bad things, the only realistic option is suicide.\n", "author": "J. J.

I actually think that they're a real threat and I think the world aren't doing enough to stop them.\nWe can't have members of the public supporting terror in any shape or form.\nI never said you arent entitled to your views. Hence we are having a discussion.\nWhat I find funny is the way some poeple will get their knickers in a bunch over this guy, yet will not for one minute discuss the REAL issue.\nWho are ISIS? Where did they come from? Who backed them?\nIf you look into this, I guarantee you wont be so angry at this Bryce guy ( and, YES, I agree, what he did was wrong)\nISIS is essentially Al-Qaeda Iraq. They are fighting a sectarian war against the US approved, but Shia majority government in Iraq. They are Sunni extremists, in the Wahhabist tradition of Saudi Arabia, and since the Syrian Civil War, have been openly backed by Saudi Arabia. The US are also keen to overthrow Assad, so US money has gone to the \"rebels\". However the rebels have largely been taken over by ISIS in the last 2 years, so all US and Saudi \"aid\" has been gracefully accepted by ISIS!\nIn essense, the US is supporting a terror organisation who are fighting against them in Iraq. Go Figure.  Remember the joy when the Marines took Fallujah in 2004?  Bet you didnt see as much fanfare when those bastard ISIS thugs took it back, using US supplied weapons and Hummers?\nSo you still pissed at this guy and his buck? You should get down to the Saudi Embassy and ask why do they support sectarian extremists in Syria and Iraq. And then ask your congressman why the US is still alligning itself with Saudi's who are openly hostile to anyone who is not a strict fundamentalist Sunni. ( that includes Shia, Alawites, Christians, Jews, etc.\nYeah, this is a very informative post. I don't know that much about the whole Iraq / Iran / U.S. manipulation thing. I probably should read up on it more to be a good world citizen (bla bla) but, like most Americans, I really don't care that much about their struggles beyond the belief that we shouldn't be messing in their internal affairs. If they nuclear carpet bombed each other in a triangle from Yemen to Pakistan to Turkey I doubt most Americans that didn't emigrate from that region would lose any sleep.\n", "author": "QuestionAuthority Legendary Offline Activity: 1960 Merit: 1315 You lead and I'll watch you walk away.

Do I have a crazy imagination, or is this possible?\nPossible, but unlikely. This happens nowadays because of randomness.\nLet me explain. Miners are really only hashing the block header. The block header contains several fields, of relevance here are the merkle root and the nonce. The merkle root is the hash of all of the transactions included in the block. If there are no transactions except the coinbase, the merkle root will be the coinbase transaction's hash. The nonce is a 32 bit integer which the miner will iterate through all of its possibilities until the header's hash is below the target hash. Additionally, there is another field in the coinbase called the extranonce which some miners will also use. This is also iterated through to change the merkle root to find the hash that is less than the target. When mining, only these two fields will change in order to have on changing variable. Everything else, including the merkle root and thus the transactions in the block, stays constant while the miner iterates through the nonces and extranonces. If none of the nonces and extranonces produce a hash that is lower than the target, they will rebuild the entire header, a new timestamp, new merkle root by including transactions, and so on. Then the miner repeats the process again.\nA miner begins mining on a block after the previous was found when there are no transactions of high enough priority. It will create the header with a merkle root that has only 1 transaction, the coinbase. It then goes through all of the nonces and extranonces to find the hash lower than the target. Sometimes it will find the hash without going through the entire set of nonces and extranonces and thus the merkle root and the transactions in the block will remain at 1 transaction. If it iterates the entire set and doesn't find the hash, which is very very likely, then it rebuilds as I said above and suddenly, there are now transactions included in the next block header it attempts to hash.

And when not done correctly, it can create a persistent liability for the user.\nJust considering fingerprints, the most common one today : first, you want a good quality sensor to collect your fingerprints (otherwise, this can be fooled by a fake finger, gummy bear or whatever) - most consumer grade products fail right there. Then, you want to connect it securely to your matching logic (otherwise, every malware or physical attack can reveal your digital fingerprints, again, you don't want that to happen since it's complicated to revoke a finger without chopping it off, and a digital fingerprint can be a great way to fake authentication into other brittle systems). Finally, you want a secure, fast and reliable matching logic (secure for the same reasons as before, fast and reliable because the user experience is going to suck otherwise)\nApple actually does most parts right as described in\nhttps://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf\n- but that's more the exception than the norm, and of course the generic consumer grade sensor is still bad.\nThe Secure Enclave is responsible for processing fingerprint data from the Touch ID\nsensor, determining if there is a match against registered fingerprints, and then\nenabling access or purchases on behalf of the user. Communication between the\nprocessor and the Touch ID sensor takes place over a serial peripheral interface\nbus. The processor forwards the data to the Secure Enclave but cannot read it. Its\nencrypted and authenticated with a session key that is negotiated using the devices\nshared key that is provisioned for the Touch ID sensor and the Secure Enclave. The\nsession key exchange uses AES key wrapping with both sides providing a random\nkey that establishes the session key and uses AES-CCM transport encryption.\nYou'll have similar requirements for other biometrics - good sensor, secure pairing with the matching logic, secure, fast and reliable matching logic. Also matching logics are complex and highly proprietary, which doesn't really fit that well into Bitcoin decentralized and trustless design either. It's quite difficult to be able to evaluate yourself how snake oilish it really is - for a good laugh, just ask your local fingerprint solutions vendor how the matching algorithm works, or even how minutiae are encoded.\n", "author": "btchip Hero Member Offline Activity: 628 Merit: 500 CTO, Ledger "}, {"date": "2015-06-19 15:00:23", "content": "I love biometric, when ever i have to use anything biometric it feel like ultimate security, i was just wondering if anyone has seen a dna biometric authentication?\n", "author": "Argwai96 Legendary Offline Activity: 1036 Merit: 1000 Thug for life!

Can you get paid in cash or bitcoin? If not then you are going to have some major difficulties!\nI'm currently paid 100% in Bitcoin through bitwage.co.  I pay for as much as I can using bitcoins. I actively sell bitcoins on localbitcoins so I usually have plenty of cash for buying food and paying rent.\nIf they shut down my bank account I can probably have my tenants direct deposit directly to my bitwage bitcoin address and I am looking at billpayforcoins.com to see if they can handle my mortgage payment. My goal this year is definitely to go into 2016 with no bank account. I have confidence in the Bitcoin community filling the final pieces necessary to do that.\nThis is great, I don't know any other person that is taking it this far. My question is, do you tax your BTC? I assume you want to avoid to do that, but let's say you eventually buy a property paying with BTC: How would you go about it? The government would find out you own a house sooner or later, and they will want to know how did you pay, and where did that money come from. You'll not have any other explanation but telling the truth, which means they'll want to know your total BTC stack and tax your ass.\nAlso, what do you think about using exchanges like multisigna + mixing the coins before doing so? are you still in trouble with the law that way? I want to be as anonymous as possible, no one needs to know the movements I make with my money, that is just so fucking annoying.\n", "author": "thejaytiesto Legendary Offline Activity: 1302 Merit: 1004 "}, {"date": "2015-05-08 17:55:25", "content": "Although we want it there are lots of sites where you can't pay with bitcoin and only accept credit card,what will you do if you need credit card forcedly?\n", "author": "cryptworld Hero Member Offline Activity: 686 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-05-08 21:34:26", "content": "Elwar, that's where I am.

I could have had any phone I wanted but I simply love that one and I bought a new battery on Amazon for 12$ which works just fine!\nOf course, you could say, that's a small scale example but...

I say that, if I can, I say no.\nNice discussion\nThe concept of loans isn't evil. The institutions loaning the money are. If you borrow $40k from your parents to attend college and promise to repay the loan over 10 years they won't destroy your financial future if you miss a few payments. Banks will chase you to the ends of the earth, destroy your credit rating, garnish your wages and attach a property lien on your possessions to get paid. Because that process is so destructive you'd be lucky if you could rent an apartment when it's over. I hate the process of commercial loans and lending. I just haven't seen a decent alternative yet.\nYes QA. I also said it is neither good nor bad. I understand what you mean. But as you specified one thing is to borrow money from a \"trusted\" source i.e. your parents, another thing is to go to a leech of whatever kind (banks &amp; co.).\nIf you pass me this I could say that maybe this whole thing of building up credit, avoid overdrafts, use credit cards instead of money one might already have, this whole mechanism is evil. This is the problem.\nWe should be aware that everything start from our choice. Please don't answer \"I have no choice\". But go back to the roots of those choices and see if you could have done it differently.\nthese are my 2 cents\nIf I could go back and do it over I would do one thing differently to change my financial future. I would never have married. That one life decision can make you or break you and having kids is like having a garden hose connected to your wallet. You seem to walk around spraying money everywhere when you have children. One little cheap latex tube could have made me and additional mountain of money. The loans I've made in my life have always improved my situation whether it was a personal or a business loan. My bad decision wasn't related to the evil banking world, it was having a vagina around to vacuum away my money. Day before yesterday my wife came home with a little bag from Sephora. You couldn't fit a loaf of bread in the bag. I asked her how much she spent and she responded, \"just a little less than $500\".

Most employers need a certain amount of notice in order to change where your direct deposit payment is sent to, so if/when bitwage.co runs into problems and/or turns into the next gox, you could potentially have two, or maybe even three pay periods worth of money sent to them depending on how quickly you can see they are having problems.\nI think it is good to use/spend your bitcoin as much as you can, however I don't think it is smart to entrust a third party with so much of your money as you are doing.\nI actively sell bitcoins on localbitcoins so I usually have plenty of cash for buying food and paying rent.\nOur of curiosity, when you sell on LBC, are you able to get above market rates, or do you need to lose some amount to liquidity providers?\nIf BitWage has any problems I would know about it within hours of missing my paycheck. My paycheck is every other Friday, I usually get an e-mail about 6-7PM on that day with the amount of bitcoins deposited into my account and the rate. If this did not happen I could call them, if they give me the run around I would call my company and have them reverse the direct deposit(which would be a hassle, but possible). And from there I would certainly drop them. So at most, one paycheck is lost if they go under. They don't keep peoples bitcoins though. I gave them my bitcoin address that I have in cold storage, they send to that address immediately once the direct deposit goes through.\nI guess if you really stayed on top of it, and were really paranoid then I would think you would have no more then one paycheck at risk at any time. However I would think there would be some reasonable explanations that many people would be able/willing to accept as to why they are not sending your bitcoin to you immediately. At the company I work for, you need to give roughly 6ish days notice to have direct deposit information changed, and I don't think they would be willing to reverse a direct deposit, although I have not tried.\nFor localbitcoins I am getting 10% above the market rate, I get enough for spending money and rent each month.\nVery nice, this is essentially at least a 2-3% bonus (depending on how much of your salary you need to convert into fiat, price declines, ect.) raise over your normal wage.

I live outside the US working for a US company. If you live outside the US for more than 330 days out of the year you qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion. This means that the first $100k of my salary is tax free and I can write off any housing costs. My situation is unique in that I work as a contractor for the US military so I do not have to pay taxes in the country I live in (I can even avoid paying VAT, but usually don't bother with the process).\nThat has nothing to do with bitcoin, however is a pretty sweet deal.

My friend at work just had over $800 taken out of his bank account this week for his phone bill that was linked to his account. He was having trouble with his phone plan so he switched to a different one on the site. He did not realize that the new plan charged 40 cents per kB of data while all of the plans he used before had data included. I've had so many automatic fees taken out of my bank account that I've had to dispute. One that charged me $50 per month for over a year that I could not get the right number or department to turn it off, finally going to the bank to get them to block it.\nWith Bitcoin I control my money. My hosting service charges me monthly in bitcoins. If I want to stop my service I stop the payments. If I stay at a hotel and they want to tack on some fees after I've left...they cannot, I paid with bitcoins. I don't have to worry about insufficient fund fees kicking in because of a bad ordering of payments which then snowball for a bunch of tiny purchases. I don't have to pay yearly credit card fees or interest payments ever again.\nI can get paid in bitcoins from my US company and sell those bitcoins for a profit in euros to spend instead of paying for a wire transfer and currency exchange fee plus ATM fees to get the money from my paycheck.\nNo, please, there are ways to avoid all that. No company has any right to make direct debits on my account, I haven't paid for any fee for a wire transfer for over a year, and I've only paid ATM fee once this year because I had no time to go to the fee-less ATM. I had a bank account with ridiculous fees, but I quickly closed it. With a bit of organization, banks work. You can make\nBTC\nworks too, but\nBTC\nalso calls for organization.\nThe problem as I sse it today, is that if you want to avoid cards, you'll always end up spending more. You can fly Easyjet without a credit card, but you'll pay more. I bought a car in Germany last week.

(I probably shouldn't be saying on a public forum that people can still get to those ads...so shhh).\nAnyway, I get a message from someone who really needed some money. He arrived in Germany to work and the ATM ate his card. He tried to get his wife to Western Union him some money but he had a hard time finding one and the fees were more than my ridiculous exchange rate (20% discount). So he contacted me and I really could not pass up such a rate so I gave him all the cash I had available. I had deposited a lot the week before so I only had a few hundred euro available. I had a few sales so I had some spending money again but he contacted me again a week later. He was moving into an apartment and needed some money. I again gave him everything I had, only a few hundred euro.\nLong story short, I was starting to run out of food and money for spending.\nUsually I have cash around so it's no big deal. I finally had to go into my big pile of coins that I've been amassing since I arrived in Europe. Fortunately they have a 2 euro coin and I just throw those to the side like they're quarters.

I work for the military so I can use the Commissary to buy cheap American food but they only take dollars. I also fill up my gas card with dollars which gives me US prices at the pump. I did fill that up with $200 last month and I drive a Smart car so I should be good for about half a year. I was thinking maybe I could buy popular gadgets for 35% off on Amazon through purse.io and sell it to people on post for dollars through the local craigslist.

(I probably shouldn't be saying on a public forum that people can still get to those ads...so shhh).\nAnyway, I get a message from someone who really needed some money. He arrived in Germany to work and the ATM ate his card. He tried to get his wife to Western Union him some money but he had a hard time finding one and the fees were more than my ridiculous exchange rate (20% discount). So he contacted me and I really could not pass up such a rate so I gave him all the cash I had available. I had deposited a lot the week before so I only had a few hundred euro available. I had a few sales so I had some spending money again but he contacted me again a week later. He was moving into an apartment and needed some money. I again gave him everything I had, only a few hundred euro.\nLong story short, I was starting to run out of food and money for spending.\nUsually I have cash around so it's no big deal. I finally had to go into my big pile of coins that I've been amassing since I arrived in Europe. Fortunately they have a 2 euro coin and I just throw those to the side like they're quarters. I was fine but that was the first time I felt the pinch of not being able to access my money and taught me that I need to keep some reserves around just in case. Fortunately rent is not due until the end of the month and I have enough people buying bitcoins that I am caught up now but that gave me a flashback to the college days of scraping up change for food.\nThe problem I see now is getting dollars. I work for the military so I can use the Commissary to buy cheap American food but they only take dollars. I also fill up my gas card with dollars which gives me US prices at the pump. I did fill that up with $200 last month and I drive a Smart car so I should be good for about half a year. I was thinking maybe I could buy popular gadgets for 35% off on Amazon through purse.io and sell it to people on post for dollars through the local craigslist. And I think it is better that I not eat American food anyway, it's probably healthier to spend the extra few euros for German food. I just need to get used to less preservatives means cooking things quicker.\nI am looking to go on a vacation in France next week so we'll see how that goes.\nNice story..! Although I cannot agree with you that german food is much healthier than american food. Germans eat like not veggies at all!

Reducing the hashrate doesn't affect much. There are still many other companies all around the world. It will never be possible for every miner to own a license. The fact that you can mine while connected to tor makes it even harder. A simple firmware mod can easily bypass the \"kill switch\" you said. Furthermore, to regulate mining, you are going to have to regulate the computer industry as a whole too. Don't forget CPU and GPU can also mine.\n", "author": "ranochigo Legendary Offline Activity: 1540 Merit: 1083 "}, {"date": "2015-06-18 07:34:08", "content": "No, bitcoin is not vulnerable ,but, some associates are vulnerable &amp; they have to fix immediately !\n", "author": "ammy009 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 305 Merit: 250 ★Pi Coin★ [POS+POW] [NO ICO] !

There are too many egos, and ulterior motives involved for a strong Bitcoin to emerge on the other side.\nDoesn't matter.\nIf anyone stands in the way of honey badger, honey badger just eats through their torso and out the other side. In other words, if it became clear to the larger community of investors, infrastructure owners, and luminaries that some of the devs were obstructing changes for political or other irrelevant reasons, someone in the community - maybe Gavin, maybe anyone - will create a fork with the required changes and after deliberation and testing the vast majority would adopt it.\nPersonalities cannot stop Bitcoin. If they try, they just get left behind coding for a worthless fork. Investors are who is\nin control\n.\nOr look at it this way, in what other system in the world do people debate so carefully and thoroughly, so far in advance, about such relatively minor changes that hypothetically\nmight\ncause a temporary issue? The answer is, only in the most important, civilization-wide mission-critical systems. This should tell you how big of a thing Bitcoin is. This level of debate shows the world we're very serious and are thinking through every nook and cranny of possibility to ensure that this baby grows up to take on the world.\nDon't confuse vigorous debate, posturing, and alarmism for gridlock. These things are inevitable because of how much money is on the line. Gavin already agreed to a smaller increase like Peter Todd wanted and to Jeff Garzik's proposal. Consensus is not far away, and a little nudge from full blocks and some pain of backlog will be all that is needed to push through a modest increase, after which the precedent will have been set against the radical \"1MB forever\" people, so that will be out of the way, and also we'll have better data to argue from. For example, if the new block space soon fills up with spam, we'll know we need to optimize via fees instead next time, and if node count doesn't go down much and large miners don't trample smaller miners then the centralization argument sputters out.\n", "author": "Zangelbert Bingledack Legendary Offline Activity: 1036 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-06-15 13:16:12", "content": "...\nInstead, each blockchain would act like its own cryptocurrency, and you'd have to check with each merchant (or any individual) before you sent them anything to find out which bitcoin they are using.  In that situation, many merchants might choose to accept transactions on both blockchains until one chain reaches an economic superiority.\nThat is very nice.

It's common for people involved in cryptocurrency to disapprove of many of the responses to jihad. They often complain about the invasion of privacy and loss of liberty. I agree with all of this. However, many people seem to have a problem believing that it's possible to disapprove of these responses while at the same time believing jihad is a very real and very serious problem. People new to the community probably pick up on these cues and see it's popular to complain about the response to jihad and that it's unpopular to say jihad is real. This naturally leads some people to say jihad isn't real -- that \"jihadi\" violence is all just a response to how terrible \"we\" are. I've heard Bryce Weiner (and other people in crypto I could name) make excuses for jihadis along these lines. I don't remember exactly what he said, just that I stopped the video right after he said it and thought, \"What a goddamn idiot.\" The only video I'll watch of him in the future is if he's being beheaded by jihadis.\nSo I'm not surprised at all that Weiner felt comfortable donating to ISIS. He probably considers them \"freedom fighters\" against the real bad guys in the world. I am pleasantly surprised there hasn't been more support for ISIS in this thread.\nWhile I'm not a big fan of Christianity, the infamous Luke Jr. may have done Bitcoin a big favor by writing Catholic prayers into the Bitcoin blockchain. People should spread the word that it's in there. If Bitcoin were to be declared\nharam\n, jihadis could move on to a\nhalal\naltcoin.\nI support terrorism every time I pay taxes\nThen you should do one of two things:\n1) Vote to change the government you live under to not be the \"terrorists\" you think they are, or\n2) Move to a place where the government is one that you don't deem as \"terrorists\"\nIn most societies, taxes paid are due to the fact that the citizens have voted to pay those taxes. If you don't agree with those taxes do something to organize your citizens to vote the taxes away or don't live in that jurisdiction.\nWhy do people feel they are so helpless?\nOption 2 is good for most people in the world (including Canadians like me), but from what I've read it doesn't apply to Americans. The U.S. government still demands taxes from its citizens if they move away. They also demand huge \"exit taxes\" to give up citizenship. (Read about Roger Ver's case.) Basically, if you're an American and you don't want to pay taxes to support lots of very bad things, the only realistic option is suicide.\n", "author": "J. J.

Do I have a crazy imagination, or is this possible?\nPossible, but unlikely. This happens nowadays because of randomness.\nLet me explain. Miners are really only hashing the block header. The block header contains several fields, of relevance here are the merkle root and the nonce. The merkle root is the hash of all of the transactions included in the block. If there are no transactions except the coinbase, the merkle root will be the coinbase transaction's hash. The nonce is a 32 bit integer which the miner will iterate through all of its possibilities until the header's hash is below the target hash. Additionally, there is another field in the coinbase called the extranonce which some miners will also use. This is also iterated through to change the merkle root to find the hash that is less than the target. When mining, only these two fields will change in order to have on changing variable. Everything else, including the merkle root and thus the transactions in the block, stays constant while the miner iterates through the nonces and extranonces. If none of the nonces and extranonces produce a hash that is lower than the target, they will rebuild the entire header, a new timestamp, new merkle root by including transactions, and so on. Then the miner repeats the process again.\nA miner begins mining on a block after the previous was found when there are no transactions of high enough priority. It will create the header with a merkle root that has only 1 transaction, the coinbase. It then goes through all of the nonces and extranonces to find the hash lower than the target. Sometimes it will find the hash without going through the entire set of nonces and extranonces and thus the merkle root and the transactions in the block will remain at 1 transaction. If it iterates the entire set and doesn't find the hash, which is very very likely, then it rebuilds as I said above and suddenly, there are now transactions included in the next block header it attempts to hash.

Either way, it is not an attack on the blockchain (how would it be?).\nThis actually is incorrect.  There are (almost) always transactions in the mempool with enough priority to be included.  However, some pools (generally the ones based on eloipool) opt to push out an empty template block to miners when a new block is found on the network to have the least possible delay between a new network block and miners beginning to work on it.  They then send a proper block template with transactions shortly after.  Some mining software does not immediately switch to the newest work, or sometimes the miner actually solves a block on the empty template before those pools manage to send one with transactions.\nIt's an ugly hack, and the performance gain is virtually nothing on other mining software (BTC Guild and ckpool have no issue producing a proper block template and sending it to miners immediately).\n", "author": "eleuthria Legendary Offline Activity: 1750 Merit: 1001 "}, {"date": "2015-06-19 07:46:42", "content": "there is already a discussion ongoing about this\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1085800.0\nbasically they usefulness is releated to secure more the next block and confirm the previous transaction\n", "author": "Amph Legendary Offline Activity: 1988 Merit: 1001 "}, {"date": "2015-06-19 10:17:09", "content": "Luckily this wouldn't be a problem with Proof of Stake blocks so in case miners start to damage the network with this selfish mining we could introduce PoS blocks and turn bitcoin into PoW/PoS hybrid.\n", "author": "Hyena Legendary Offline Activity: 1960 Merit: 1002 "}, {"date": "2015-06-20 16:14:00", "content": "Empty blocks are normal.

And when not done correctly, it can create a persistent liability for the user.\nJust considering fingerprints, the most common one today : first, you want a good quality sensor to collect your fingerprints (otherwise, this can be fooled by a fake finger, gummy bear or whatever) - most consumer grade products fail right there. Then, you want to connect it securely to your matching logic (otherwise, every malware or physical attack can reveal your digital fingerprints, again, you don't want that to happen since it's complicated to revoke a finger without chopping it off, and a digital fingerprint can be a great way to fake authentication into other brittle systems). Finally, you want a secure, fast and reliable matching logic (secure for the same reasons as before, fast and reliable because the user experience is going to suck otherwise)\nApple actually does most parts right as described in\nhttps://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf\n- but that's more the exception than the norm, and of course the generic consumer grade sensor is still bad.\nThe Secure Enclave is responsible for processing fingerprint data from the Touch ID\nsensor, determining if there is a match against registered fingerprints, and then\nenabling access or purchases on behalf of the user. Communication between the\nprocessor and the Touch ID sensor takes place over a serial peripheral interface\nbus. The processor forwards the data to the Secure Enclave but cannot read it. Its\nencrypted and authenticated with a session key that is negotiated using the devices\nshared key that is provisioned for the Touch ID sensor and the Secure Enclave. The\nsession key exchange uses AES key wrapping with both sides providing a random\nkey that establishes the session key and uses AES-CCM transport encryption.\nYou'll have similar requirements for other biometrics - good sensor, secure pairing with the matching logic, secure, fast and reliable matching logic. Also matching logics are complex and highly proprietary, which doesn't really fit that well into Bitcoin decentralized and trustless design either. It's quite difficult to be able to evaluate yourself how snake oilish it really is - for a good laugh, just ask your local fingerprint solutions vendor how the matching algorithm works, or even how minutiae are encoded.\n", "author": "btchip Hero Member Offline Activity: 628 Merit: 500 CTO, Ledger "}, {"date": "2015-06-19 15:00:23", "content": "I love biometric, when ever i have to use anything biometric it feel like ultimate security, i was just wondering if anyone has seen a dna biometric authentication?\n", "author": "Argwai96 Legendary Offline Activity: 1036 Merit: 1000 Thug for life!

If Bitcoin is over $1k I will pay the guy with bitcoins. Otherwise I will sell my house and pay for it.\nAs for asking where I got the money...I will likely be buying the boat in a foreign country, most likely registering it under a bahamas flag. If I do pay with bitcoins I will do my darndest to pay the appropriate income taxes because I love the IRS and want to have sex with any agent reading this.\nI always dramed with living on a boat, but at the end of the day I always chickened out, because I wouldn't feel as safe as living on a house/flat.\nIf you do buy it on some far away island to register it over there... are you going to live on that island, or you will go back to europe/america?\nIf so what kind of boat are we talking about that could travel that far?\nI am looking at somewhere around 40 foot catamaran sailboat. I would just live wherever the weather is nice. Though I am looking at seasteading options.

I say that, if I can, I say no.\nNice discussion\nThe concept of loans isn't evil. The institutions loaning the money are. If you borrow $40k from your parents to attend college and promise to repay the loan over 10 years they won't destroy your financial future if you miss a few payments. Banks will chase you to the ends of the earth, destroy your credit rating, garnish your wages and attach a property lien on your possessions to get paid. Because that process is so destructive you'd be lucky if you could rent an apartment when it's over. I hate the process of commercial loans and lending. I just haven't seen a decent alternative yet.\nYes QA. I also said it is neither good nor bad. I understand what you mean. But as you specified one thing is to borrow money from a \"trusted\" source i.e. your parents, another thing is to go to a leech of whatever kind (banks &amp; co.).\nIf you pass me this I could say that maybe this whole thing of building up credit, avoid overdrafts, use credit cards instead of money one might already have, this whole mechanism is evil. This is the problem.\nWe should be aware that everything start from our choice. Please don't answer \"I have no choice\".

I would never have married. That one life decision can make you or break you and having kids is like having a garden hose connected to your wallet. You seem to walk around spraying money everywhere when you have children. One little cheap latex tube could have made me and additional mountain of money. The loans I've made in my life have always improved my situation whether it was a personal or a business loan. My bad decision wasn't related to the evil banking world, it was having a vagina around to vacuum away my money. Day before yesterday my wife came home with a little bag from Sephora.

My friend at work just had over $800 taken out of his bank account this week for his phone bill that was linked to his account. He was having trouble with his phone plan so he switched to a different one on the site. He did not realize that the new plan charged 40 cents per kB of data while all of the plans he used before had data included. I've had so many automatic fees taken out of my bank account that I've had to dispute. One that charged me $50 per month for over a year that I could not get the right number or department to turn it off, finally going to the bank to get them to block it.\nWith Bitcoin I control my money. My hosting service charges me monthly in bitcoins. If I want to stop my service I stop the payments. If I stay at a hotel and they want to tack on some fees after I've left...they cannot, I paid with bitcoins. I don't have to worry about insufficient fund fees kicking in because of a bad ordering of payments which then snowball for a bunch of tiny purchases. I don't have to pay yearly credit card fees or interest payments ever again.\nI can get paid in bitcoins from my US company and sell those bitcoins for a profit in euros to spend instead of paying for a wire transfer and currency exchange fee plus ATM fees to get the money from my paycheck.\nNo, please, there are ways to avoid all that. No company has any right to make direct debits on my account, I haven't paid for any fee for a wire transfer for over a year, and I've only paid ATM fee once this year because I had no time to go to the fee-less ATM. I had a bank account with ridiculous fees, but I quickly closed it. With a bit of organization, banks work. You can make\nBTC\nworks too, but\nBTC\nalso calls for organization.\nThe problem as I sse it today, is that if you want to avoid cards, you'll always end up spending more. You can fly Easyjet without a credit card, but you'll pay more. I bought a car in Germany last week. Germans usually don't pay the registration tax on the spot, they give their bank account details, and the money is taken off their account sometimes later.

(I probably shouldn't be saying on a public forum that people can still get to those ads...so shhh).\nAnyway, I get a message from someone who really needed some money. He arrived in Germany to work and the ATM ate his card. He tried to get his wife to Western Union him some money but he had a hard time finding one and the fees were more than my ridiculous exchange rate (20% discount). So he contacted me and I really could not pass up such a rate so I gave him all the cash I had available. I had deposited a lot the week before so I only had a few hundred euro available. I had a few sales so I had some spending money again but he contacted me again a week later. He was moving into an apartment and needed some money. I again gave him everything I had, only a few hundred euro.\nLong story short, I was starting to run out of food and money for spending.\nUsually I have cash around so it's no big deal. I finally had to go into my big pile of coins that I've been amassing since I arrived in Europe. Fortunately they have a 2 euro coin and I just throw those to the side like they're quarters. I was fine but that was the first time I felt the pinch of not being able to access my money and taught me that I need to keep some reserves around just in case. Fortunately rent is not due until the end of the month and I have enough people buying bitcoins that I am caught up now but that gave me a flashback to the college days of scraping up change for food.\nThe problem I see now is getting dollars.

Germans usually don't pay the registration tax on the spot, they give their bank account details, and the money is taken off their account sometimes later.

I hope that someday, companies will give you a discount if you pay with\nBTC\n, but I don't see that coming soon for anything I usually buy.\nInteresting, I bought a car in Germany last fall. I had no cash and to transfer that much over would have taken days. I could take money from my US bank account at the ATM at a heavy conversion and ATM fee which had a limit of 4-500 euro per day so it would have taken me 10 days of doing that to get the cash. Instead I went on localbitcoins and got 5000 euros for my 12 bitcoins (price was higher at the time) and paid the private seller in cash. It is probably different for me since I go through the military for registration. That was a hassle of its own.\nWhat part of Germany are you in?\nI was in Koln, but I left on the 11th, and I have already been to 3 other countries since then. Travel is my life!\nIt's quite true that ATMs aren't good tools to withdraw large sums, but if you're with an international bank, you can make larger withdrawals at the counter.

(I probably shouldn't be saying on a public forum that people can still get to those ads...so shhh).\nAnyway, I get a message from someone who really needed some money. He arrived in Germany to work and the ATM ate his card. He tried to get his wife to Western Union him some money but he had a hard time finding one and the fees were more than my ridiculous exchange rate (20% discount). So he contacted me and I really could not pass up such a rate so I gave him all the cash I had available. I had deposited a lot the week before so I only had a few hundred euro available. I had a few sales so I had some spending money again but he contacted me again a week later. He was moving into an apartment and needed some money. I again gave him everything I had, only a few hundred euro.\nLong story short, I was starting to run out of food and money for spending.\nUsually I have cash around so it's no big deal. I finally had to go into my big pile of coins that I've been amassing since I arrived in Europe. Fortunately they have a 2 euro coin and I just throw those to the side like they're quarters. I was fine but that was the first time I felt the pinch of not being able to access my money and taught me that I need to keep some reserves around just in case. Fortunately rent is not due until the end of the month and I have enough people buying bitcoins that I am caught up now but that gave me a flashback to the college days of scraping up change for food.\nThe problem I see now is getting dollars.

Reducing the hashrate doesn't affect much. There are still many other companies all around the world. It will never be possible for every miner to own a license. The fact that you can mine while connected to tor makes it even harder. A simple firmware mod can easily bypass the \"kill switch\" you said. Furthermore, to regulate mining, you are going to have to regulate the computer industry as a whole too. Don't forget CPU and GPU can also mine.\n", "author": "ranochigo Legendary Offline Activity: 1540 Merit: 1083 "}, {"date": "2015-06-18 07:34:08", "content": "No, bitcoin is not vulnerable ,but, some associates are vulnerable &amp; they have to fix immediately !\n", "author": "ammy009 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 305 Merit: 250 ★Pi Coin★ [POS+POW] [NO ICO] !
