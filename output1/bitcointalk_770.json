All donations will come from supporters and sponsors in the form of Bitcoin.\nWe are in the talks with a major supplier of BTC chargable debit cards, that will enable us to spend ALL neccessary expenses that CANNOT be spent in BTC, WITH BTC! Instead of paying with EUR or USD, we can just top up our account with donations in the form of Bitcoin and say:\n\"Hey, you dont take Bitcoin? Here, take my Debit card instead. Its a Bitcoin card!\"\nOn top of that, this project aims to be as open and transparent as possible. Everyone that has a good idea for an interview or how to make the movie/site/planning better is encouraged to take part! We will account for all the expenses in our blog, post current pictures and videos from the sets and turn this whole movie into a full fledged crowd funded, crowd sourced project of the Bitcoin Community!\nFirst interviews have already been arranged with the owners of\nBitcoin.de\n, Germany's largest Bitcoin exchange as well as privacy experts Frank Braun and Jonathan Logan from\nshadowlife.cc\nand conducted with Trace Mayer, among others.

My course of studies consists of theoretical elements of film (and other media) production, as well as practical ones. I have taken part in several film projects during my 3 years there on set and in the Marketing Department of a larger production.\nMy team consists of 4 students, doing their Master's Degree in \"Media Technics\", all have prior experience in practical film production and theoretical knowledge.\nOur campus is equipped with the most up to date devices and infrastructure neccessary for recording and editing movies. All of witch are available to us. Different film projects are currently being developed there which an able community of young film makers, that can contribute to this project if need arises.\nSo we got the Know How, the Equipment and the Support to make this documentary reality. The only thing missing is MONEY!\nTo stay with the spirit of the Bitcoin project, I decided to raise funds exclusively with Bitcoin from the community that it comes from in the most transparent and open way possible instead of asking private or governmental film promotion funds to give me the money under some restrictive licenses.\nHow much money do we need?\nTo make this movie as awesome as it can get, we need to collect about 10.000 EUR or 13.000 USD in BTC. With this money we can traveler to conferences, developers, entrepreneurs and miners all over the world! If we get less then that, the movie will still be cool, but not as many interesting people and places will be in it, so yeah, if this documentation shall reflect the international concentrated power of the Bitcoin project, we need to raise those funds!\nAsk me anything!\n1. Question: Who would you like to see on the Docu?\nSome Silk Road Dealer, the BIGGEST mining farms from within or Kim Dotcom?\nPlease make some suggestions!\nNominations so far:\nGavin Andresen\nAshton Kutcher\nAlan Reiner (Armory developer)\nBen Bernanke\nPirateat40\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nAssignments:\nGeneral advice:\nPls use best equipment available. Anything below 720i is not so likely to be included. If you have to, make sure the material is good;)\nLow resolution should only be considered if intended for some effect (e.g. surveillance camera, media res, etc.)\nAlso try not to shake too much while holding your device, use tripods if available or look for other structures to support your camera. Its always easier to film and turn away from the sun or other sources of light, then to turn towards it. If sound is recorded, pls make sure its clear of too much background noise, wind, or else and relevant things can be understood well. Use external microphones if available. No loss in recorded data can be brought back in post production. If resolution is bad, we cant \"turn it up\" afterwards, if you are too loud or too silent, your recording device won't pick it all up and lossy compression methods (see:\nwikipedia\n) should be avoided as well. Pls try to provide us with the best quality possible.\n-\nLIVE TRANSACTION\n(open for public, receiving submissions)\nMake a live Bitcoin transaction with someone far, far away! Take footage on both ends of the deal and also some impressions of the area [e.g. a pan across the skyline of the town you are in, a time-lapse cruise through your area from a subway or car window (can also be turned into time lapse from real time footage in post production) or from the top of some world famous monument)]!\nPost links below! Thread will be updated with submissions.\nBest ones will be picked and have a high chance to be put into final movie!\n-\nSPANISH INTERVIEW TRANSLATION\n(currently being worked on by\nJaques\n, please post if interested)\nWe need one or two translators of the interview shot with a 62 years old Bitcoin aficionado in Argentina. The footage has not yet been released and will remain secret till the making of is being released. To avoid leaking this super secret interview only one or two trusted individuals with great Spanish skills will be entrusted to translate and subtitle to whole interview (ca. 20 minutes). Successful candidates will also receive other benefits, as their contribution will be valued equal to a 5 BTC donation to the project (see\ndonation page\nfor list of privileges).\n-\nLEGAL ADVICE\n(open for public, please post in comments)\nPlease answer all questions in this thread:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=170854.0\nThere are a couple of legal questions that come with this project. I would like to ask you to help us out if you have any fact based knowledge. We cant afford to consult a lawyer for that and our legal department at uni is completely over worked, so pls help us out!\nWhen you try to answer these questions pls refer to them by citing the corresponding number and use articles of law whenever possible.\n1\nUnder what license should we publish our movie?\nI. It shall be the most open license possible. Our team and all contributors basically waive their rights to the material (except being the creators of the content of course), so others can freely aquire, edit, sell, broadcast, screen, possess and do whatever they want with it at no cost to them.\nII. Some licenses to look at:\nCreative Commons\n,\nCopyfree\n,\nCC0\n,\nWhatTheFuckyouwanttoPublicLicense\nIII. We have to make sure all sound tracks, video clips, art work or else contributed by supporters is also allowed to be treated under the same conditions as the work of our team. So absolutely no one can come in afterwards and claim royalties or legally prohibit the distribution of our movie in any jurisdiction.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content\nhttp://www.wtfpl.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wtfpl-strip.jpg\n2\nWHO has to sign a waiver of rights and WHAT has to be in it? Can anyone provide blanks?\nI. So far we gave a waiver to all people interviewed on camera, our team gets one, our supervisor at uni will get one and all people identifiable in miscellaneous shots, not part of a larger group were asked whether we can use their picture whith their consent on camera.\n3\nWe would like to use stock footage of different TV channels and other resources (anyone remember that Good Wife episode;)?) To use it in our open domain-like licensed movie will be difficult. Any ideas? Practice experience, work arounds? Please provide legal facts if you can!\n4\nFilming permits are to be aquired under different conditions everywhere. In most cases we make sure to either have them or to not be classified as a professional film crew under the specific conditions lined out for the locations in question. Lets say it turns out we were not allowed to film somewhere so after the movie is published some public servant stands up and demands additional payment, should we be concerned?\n5\nUnder what jurisdiction should we put our movie (if any)? After all it will be filmed in many different countries and there are different (copyright) laws in every one of those.\n-\nSENT US SATOSHI NAKAMOTO!\n(open for public, receiving submissions)\nWe will talk about Bitcoin's mysterious creator and maybe visit some of his early peers to tell his story (or what we know about it). For that, we'll need a lot of cut away footage from him. If you have any ideas on how to portait him take a camera and start to film!\nWe need footage of him basically being himself in any way you see him: sitting in a sushi bar, using the subway, sitting in front of his screen, devicing Bitcoin, being a NSA spy, earning a shit ton of money,..\nAny scenes that you can imagine we can use. In this case its not even important to record superb sound because we will most likely lay music over it or to use a good camera because those \"memories\" will fall out of the standard look of the movie anyway.\nThis is your chance to make yourself an idol of\nSatoshi Cyber Christ\n. Please post or send us your ideas and footage and we can put you in the credits for ever lasting fame!\n0.1_BTC\nAle Janda\n(First Non-Anonymous Donation)\n1.0_BTC\nTechnomage\n1.5123319_BTC\nLocalBitcoins.com\n2.0_BTC\nallkindsofshit\n10.0_BTC\nBitcoin.de\n10.0_BTC\nMike Gogulski\n(\napp.bitlaundry.com\n,\nbitcoinlaundry.com\n)\n1.0_BTC\nmolecular\n13.9645423_BTC\nBitcoin 100\n1.75_BTC\nChristopher J.

Then you can do justice to parts that otherwise get passed over too quickly.\nThis is indeed a proposition worthwhile pondering on. My initial plan was to have a frame story of a common Bitcoiner that tries to succeed in his quest, which could be anything from mining to starting a Business or organising a conference, etc. I would follow him around with the camera and while his story is used to tell his tale, the watcher can identify with him, feel for him, while different aspects of Bitcoin would be focused on, like anonymity, monetary regulation, the Bitcoin community with its various projects, always leading back to him to connect the different fields. Everything would of course be real as this is a documentary. So the Bitcoiner's story has to be a true story as well.\nNow with this proposition I see another approach to the movie. If I understand you correctly, you envision a short (30 min?) feature on lets say \"mining\", the next part of this larger Bitcoin series would be focused on \"Silk Road\" for example. This would of course result in a more thorough coverage of the topic(s) but would lack a narrative, which is the common Bitcoiner from my initial idea. It sounds more like a series for a pre educated audience, that already has a basic understanding of Bitcoin. My aspiration is to make movie, that gears towards a completely unexperienced audience to the common Bitcoin follower. I think by including the narrative structure of a main story one has more control over the arc of suspense and can create a more captivating movie. I am planning on making a 45 minute feature about Bitcoin. The topic maybe too dry/complicated to grasp for the inexperienced to keep them watching over the entire length. Therefore the element of a frame story (golden yarn) is neccessary in my opinion.\nBut why not making both? The two structures, the full length one for the casual viewer and an in-depth one for the eagerly interested could both be realized and use footage from one another. In the end of production of the 45 min. one, we will have hours and hours of material from many different areas, that could easily recombined to make shorter features of maybe 20-30 minute parts that will focus on specific aspects and give a clearer image. This is the beauty of this project, it could provide a repository for so many movies to come and everyone is invited to make their own.\nFree to use, free to share and distribute!\n", "author": "Spekulatius Legendary Offline Activity: 1022 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2013-03-09 23:17:24", "content": "SO WHAT'S WITH QUESITION # 1?\n1.

Also, if you sold 10 high-level exposure spots at $10K each from entities with a little depth in their pocketbook, that would definitely put you guys on the right path.\nAlso, I and a partner are currently developing a project of which we could help raise funds for you.

There is a conference coming up in Vienna, but I believe that is later in the year.\nI believe the SJ conference is going to have a decent guy filming it of which the footage should be readily available. If you do attend, I suggest getting the cheapest plane tickets for two and hook up with some Bitcoiner near there, staying at their home. No more than two guys should be needed for said event, one of which is your camera guy.\nSuggestion: Document where and how every bitcoin is spend, taking screenshots of the blockchain as proof, incorporating it into the documentary somehow.\nI love the idea of somehow you interview one of the hackers or scammers.\n~Bruno K~\n", "author": "Phinnaeus Gage Legendary Offline Activity: 1372 Merit: 1001 Bitcoin: An Idea Worth Spending "}, {"date": "2013-03-14 05:53:21", "content": "What you guys should do is a kickstarter clone of your page.  If people knew they would be getting a physical DVD they'd 'donate' $60.  If some of the richer bitcoineers on here were offered a producers credit they'd donate\nBTC\n200.

(and dont mind my Spanish\n)\nIf you paid for a Spanish program from psy, there's a scammer tag section on this forum. Also, Dank is the best musician I can think of on this forum. I just came up with an interesting idea while penning that last sentence. Image Dank as a busker, playing(?) his guitar, accepting donations only in bitcoins, whereupon if he reaches a certain amount, he'll stop playing. Otherwise the song(?) remains the same.\n&lt;end humor&gt;\nSeeing that there's four of you, and the documentary's based on a financial aspect, what better place to start it than here?\nAfter filming a similar work, head on over to Bank on Dave and try to convince him to start accepting/dealing-in Bitcoin. Explain to him that you're making a documentary and looking for a short term Bitcoin loan.\nFor starters, everything you guys are doing now that's Bitcoin related should be filmed, for it's all part of the project.\nBack to the Bitcoin 100 proposal.\nCurrently, we have ~$20,000 worth of bitcoins setting in our coffer. All we're asking in return for a $1,000 donation is a link on your official site and a tiny mention in the credits, something you would do for some other entity willing to donate a chuck of change. You would do it for Bank on Dave, wouldn't you?\nBut I'm willing to go one better--a lot better. But it would entail a little effort on your part, but worth the footage. I'll explain in sec, but first the following.\nOriginally, Bitcoin 100's intent was to dole out 100 BTC to any non-profit that would simple embed a Bitcoin donation option onto their website, provided they met a couple simple criteria. Four have done so, and $400 to $1,200 worth of coins were donated to them, depending on the exchange rate at the time. The purpose was, and still is, to further the awareness of Bitcoin. Now some of those early entities we approached declined when bitcoins traded in the single digits (US dollar speaking). Now at $46 a coin, they may have second thoughts seeing that there's $4,600 to be had.\nBut I foreseen this as a possibility early on, thus suggestion that at some arbitrary amount like $20 per coin should be the cutting off point for the 100 BTC donation. Since we've surpassed that mark, and Bitcoin is obtaining more exposure, it's time to cut that figure down to $1,000 per charitable organization, but not lower, as I've mentioned a few times already in Bitcoin 100's main thread.\nAnd what more venerable cause then your endeavor to start, leaving us with ~$19,000.\nHere's what I propose. First accept the $1,000 donation. Then seek out an NPO/NGO willing to embed a Bitcoin donation option onto their respective website, and they will receive a $1,000 donation. For your efforts, $500 worth of bitcoin will be transferred to your coffer.\nIdeally, it'll be nice to be filming your efforts, showing beforehand how easy this sounds, but hopefully you encounter brick walls which makes good cinema.\nDo this 12 times total, and you'll receive an additional $6,000 on top of the $1,000 we hopefully gave you, leaving $1,000 in our coffer at the current exchange rate. Hypothetically if the exchange rate remains the same after your team/network-of-friends garner the 12 non-profits, we'll give you that $1,000 as a bonus. At the end of the day, our coffer will be empty and your (ours, as in bitcoiners) documentary is well on its way. I'm sure you brainiacs can figure out a way to weave the story line in on how you had to give away thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins so that you can make this fine documentary.\nThink about it! It'll probably be the first ever documentary funded via the giving away of money opposed to the trying of obtain it. And it would only take some effort on your team's part, of which you should be able to collect some fine footage during the process, provided camera's in hand.\nFuck it! Make it only 10 NPO/NGO's you need to obtain at $1K a pop, and the rest is yours. And if the exchange rate goes higher in the coming weeks, of which it may, I pretty sure you'll have your $13K from us. We'll still dole it out at $1,000 per charity and $500 to you, with the balance transferred once the tenth charity is obtained.\nImage the footage when you receive a yes on that tenth entity. The jumping up with joy knowing that you have earned the money hoped for to make said documentary.\nWhat we get out of the deal is eleven more non-profit entities (ten, plus yourself) who've added Bitcoin donation options onto their websites. That's all we ever wanted in the first place. And if the exchange rate wouldn't have risen, the best we would have hoped for was only ~4 more with the current amount of bitcoins we have on hand.\nThe way I see it, it's a win/win for all parties concerned. The worse aspect of the entire deal is that there would be some effort on your team's (and your network of friends/associates) part. But the filming of said effort would make the quest that much more valuable.\nIf luck is on your side, you may even approach $20K worth of bitcoins.\nThe other option is doing it the old fashion way getting a dollar here, a dollar there, and in no time (no pun intended) you've have a\nsawbuck\n.\nLet me know what you think.\n~Bruno K~\n", "author": "Phinnaeus Gage Legendary Offline Activity: 1372 Merit: 1001 Bitcoin: An Idea Worth Spending "}, {"date": "2013-03-16 10:36:41", "content": "And if you accept the above offer, during the interim of you obtaining the ten non-profits we obtain one some other way, we'll still shoot you $500 worth of bitcoins, thus one less you have to secure.

(and feel free to call me Bruno if you desire) Given the above, I'm going to take the liberty to fine-tune the original proposal, with hopefully at the end of the day not take much, if any, moneys--as first outlined--off the table, and maybe even securing more funds along the way.\nWith that, you're pretty much assured the $1,000 USD from\nBitcoin 100\nto further along this endeavor.\nWhat I believe is paramount is that the ten NPO/NGOs we obtain receive as much prominent billing as possible, i.e., credits in the documentary (hopefully not in fast scroll mode), and links on your website, chiefly come to mind. Shouldn't need more than that. Please don't concern yourself with billing\nBitcoin 100\nunless we deserve credit(s).\nTherefore, the adjusted proposal (outlined shortly) is predicated on a commitment from you in regard to the above--prominently showcasing ten new non-profits (not any previously obtained prior to this tentative agreement).\nWould you have any suggestions for organizations that match Bitcoin100's apiration and could also be on the Docu?\nPossibly.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64504.0\nkenija2012 was one of the first NPOs we funded, and I'm sure those doctors may have live footage, taken while in Kenya.\nhttp://kenijaodprava.blogspot.si/2012/10/18/povzetek/\nAnother example will come to mind later, or perhaps a new entity will manifest itself, rising up for the occasion. Of course, the better the human interest storyline, the better the final cut would be.\nFrom the top of my head, I can think of all the local\nhackspaces\nthat we will visit. Would they qualify for Bitcoin100?\nProbably not. Not because of who or what they are, but because of their reach, with most functioning at the local level. An umbrella organization of said group would suffice, provided they are not already accepting bitcoins as a donation option.\nThey do seem like a fine group of folks, where a member or two may be closely connected to some charitable organization which may qualify though. But we won't know unless they're asked. Hint! Hint!\n2nd idea\n(just hit me over the head): What about organizations that may accept Bitcoin, but when we interview them first they are more likely to decline, so we show their statements as a little side story and as the plot progresses, they are shown again with footage from our second visit by which they have already accepted Bitcoin and talk about how cool it is;) ?\nOr at the very least, they reluctantly accept the offer (filmed), with a follow up video prior to the footage hitting the edit floor.\nOnce one of these ten accept, we'll do our best to work with them as they start requesting donations via Bitcoin. This will be more true if one particular entity is pose to be filmed more so than some other(s). Once we're made aware of such a fact, it'll be easier to shoot more coins their way, thus making the outcome more favorable, albeit a tad contrived.\nNow that I've address your response, allow me to outline the next step(s) below the fold.\nThe New Proposal\nDon't worry, for the changes are not too draconian. In fact, some may prove better, outweighing any negativity.\nThe first major change is that I will take lead control of the fund raising drive as it relates to\nBitcoin 100's\nefforts in the amassing of the majority of the funding for the documentary. I'll be starting a separate thread for the occasion. In fact, there'll be two threads, for it'll be a two-step process. You'll understand why in a bit (almost penned sec).\nAnother major change will be in the time frame to accomplish this task. Originally, I penned a 60-90 day max window, with your team footing the majority of the labor. Seeing from your post, and should of considered it myself earlier, you'll probably be too pressed for time to take on added burdens.\nThe new time frame will be only 30 days to accomplish said task, provided the wafers leave the FAB as scheduled.\n(couldn't resist injecting humor) This quickening should come as a blessing for a myriad of reasons.\nIn essence, I'll be setting up a 30 day donation drive/challenge starting on the first day of April (probably sooner), ending on the 30th (locked deadline). This is what thread two (mentioned above) will consist of. Thread one (started immediately) will consist of garnering support from various viable entities, willing to donate $500(?) each at the end of April if\nBitcoin 100\npulls through.\n(getting tired, but hope the gist came through--elaboration will be provided in said thread, and touch upon further below)\nQuick aside: Upon a second/third read of the quoted post, I wanted to let you know that in no way are we (am I) trying to dictate to you how, or what, to weave into the documentary as it pertains to NGOs, et al. But I will start a third thread in the Projects sections for you to peruse, asking of the members what they would like to see in the doc. Therefore, all the suggestions would be in a single thread, whereupon you'll maintain the official thread (perhaps this is it), and I'll man the donation arm, again as it only relates to\nBitcoin 100\nand none of the other funding.\nNo other addresses will be set up to collect donations by me in The Bitcoin Documentary's name. Only the address you've provided will be utilized.\nOne last major change, and that's the maximum dollar amount aspect. I've previous stated that all the funds currently residing in our coffers would go toward the making of the documentary provided a certain criteria's met, $10K of which going to actual charities. One aspect of the criteria was having your team doing most of the legwork. Since that is no longer the case due to it being impractical, I have bestowed that burden unto myself. That act alone causes us to no longer guarantee the entire pool.\nThe only way you would receive less than $10K from\nBitcoin 100\nis if the exchange rate spirals downward before the end of April, and the grand total did not come to $20K USD. If that'll be the case, all of the funds would still be allocated for this cause with the exception of a 1 BTC.\nThe maximum now that we'll transfer out for this project will only be $20,000, whereas before it had a potential of being $20K+. It equates to $10,000 USD max that you'll end up with, broken down the same way as before: namely, for each charity embedding a Bitcoin donation button onto their respective website, they'll receive $1,000, and you'll immediately receive $500; if at the end of April all ten are obtained, another $4,000 heads your way ($1K (initial) + $5K ($500 X 10) + $4K (remainder) = $10K (total); plus the dollar sum from all those betting, so to speak, that we can't do it (e.g., $500 per entity times 10 minimum equals $5K); and hopefully another $1K from The Bitcoin Foundation pledging (again, betting, so to speak) that we can't get 10 charities before the end of April\nAND\nget at least ten entities to pledge\nAND\nget at least $5K pledged from as many entities needed to surpass said figure.\nBasically, that's what thread one will consist of--garnering support prior to augment the main drive (thread two). If I did the math correctly, with all the goals met there'll be no less than $16,000 I hope to raise for this crazy documentary idea, produced by four (five) wild and crazy guys with accents.\nAgain, just assure me that you'll show prominence to ten charities if we secure them. If so, I'm moving forward with what's outlined above, unless you believe something needs addressing.\n~Bruno K~\n", "author": "Phinnaeus Gage Legendary Offline Activity: 1372 Merit: 1001 Bitcoin: An Idea Worth Spending "}, {"date": "2013-03-20 21:33:37", "content": "Haven't heard too many suggestions so far\nAs promised in my mega post above, I created a thread for just this very thing:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=12.0\nI, in now way, am connected with this endeavor, but am doing everything within my power to help them bring this venerable documentary to fruition.\n~Bruno K~\n", "author": "Phinnaeus Gage Legendary Offline Activity: 1372 Merit: 1001 Bitcoin: An Idea Worth Spending "}, {"date": "2013-03-21 00:01:38", "content": "UPDATE:\nFirst Pic from Vienna interviews\nThis pic comes fresh from the cam and has\nNOT\nbeen edited yet!\nSo please be patient and check back in a couple of days for the first brushed up sneak peeks of our Vienna interviews!\nAlways first in our\nblog\n!\n", "author": "Spekulatius Legendary Offline Activity: 1022 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2013-03-21 00:16:51", "content": "Haven't heard too many suggestions so far\nAs promised in my mega post above, I created a thread for just this very thing:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=12.0\nI, in now way, am connected with this endeavor, but am doing everything within my power to help them bring this venerable documentary to fruition.\n~Bruno K~\nThanx Bruno,\nIll give it another Mega read tomorrow;)\nToo tired right now, but I like it.\nCheers,\n★☆★Johannes★☆★\nDirector/Producer\n", "author": "Spekulatius Legendary Offline Activity: 1022 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2013-03-21 05:43:44", "content": "Just a suggestion, so please feel free to take it or leave it.

As you've quoted me above\n(in bold)\nin regard to this tier system of yours, I feel it best to dole any perks achieved via our funding efforts to those we may obtain to donating to your cause either directly or indirectly.\nFor instance, the entities I get on board to post Challenge Grants. They may be more incline to accept said rewards, perhaps donating in such a manner to reap the maximum benefits. Remember, I'm gunning for at least 10 people to pledge no less than $5,000 USD total, coupled with The Bitcoin Foundation to grant another $1,000 USD, IFF I obtain 10 new non-profits before the end of April.\nThis way you would receive no less than $16,000 USD worth of bitcoins into your coffer. As you well know, I'm already less than an inch there, since you've already received 1/16th of the my goal, with only 15/16 left to go. Now, if I were in Germany, the task at hand would be even smaller, for I would be measuring it in cm, assuming a cm is shorter than an inch.\nOne more thing that I don't want to take for granted. Those 10+ entities I've been speaking of should get proper billing as well, similar to the 10 non-profits I bring on board. In fact it's imperative that this is arranged, for it's a major selling point for me to obtain those entities. I'm sure that BitPay, Coinabul, Butterfly Labs, Mt. Gox, Memory Dealers, Satoshi Dice, et al., would love to see their names on the big screen.\n(apologies if I left off major entities on the list, but was penning from memory off the top of my...let me rephrase that)\n~Bruno K~\n", "author": "Phinnaeus Gage Legendary Offline Activity: 1372 Merit: 1001 Bitcoin: An Idea Worth Spending "}, {"date": "2013-03-25 14:12:43", "content": "I believe it's a legal requirement, mandated by international treaties, that any such documentary begins with Pink Floyd's \"Money\"\nFirst the silent typing opening, then after the first scene has ended \"Money\" with the opening credits and some kind of 'sequence'.

Yes, we are getting our hands dirty and talk to the people on the bleeding edge of the Bitcoin cosmos!

Cant give you much details on that also atm, sry but Im sure u understand. We will not get into contact with any SR dealers or users before proper protection is worked out for our team or potential interview partners, but rest assured that we will not spare this aspect.\nRegarding those \"random people\", you have been seing introduced: they are actual experts in their fields and can with proper background describe the multiple facets of Bitcoin from their perspective, may it be anonymity, economy or legal aspects. As my documentary parts into a describing/theoretical part and a real life story (see main character) that the viewer can follow throughout the movie both have their place and reason to be interviewed/followed by the camera.\nI hope this clears things up a bit.

Governments are sneakier than that, with more restrictions placed on what they dislike (or are indifferent toward) each year - but restrictions which may not be obvious. Net uhhhh... non-Neutrality poses a major risk, where ISPs in some countries do already cripple bandwidth permitted to IP addresses not in a \"fast lane whitelist.\" When whitelists are involved, shutting down cryptocoins is more viable, even if cryptocurrencies aren't the target, just collateral damage. It may result in special \"fast-lane VPS\" companies (where they're basically just subleasing their \"fast lane\" license with the major ISPs), where they'd sell (likely at a huge premium over current costs) service to NFPs, generous individuals, and corporations for transaction and block relays for the good of the network. This would likely cause a drastic decline in the number of full nodes operating and may lead to service degradation for those using full clients. It may also pose a security risk insofar as a weak relay infrastructure could allow the few remaining relays to operate on a transaction whitelist or blacklist, effectively allowing them to control who can use Bitcoin, possibly even charging for tx relay capability if there're high-enough costs associated with running full nodes.\nService disruption through ISP QoS could also come from arbitrarily increasing latency between p2p connections, which would disrupt the currently fast and robust flow of the transaction queue as well as decreasing mining profitability where implemented. None of this would kill Bitcoin, but it would make it more difficult to use and could possibly cause financial losses in cases of time-sensitive transactions (and mining). Similarly, a \"great wall\" would be a PitA for full users to deal with, but Bitcoin would still work.\nIn pretty much every serious attack possibility, the best counter-measure is a decentralized mesh Internet returning the Internet to the \"Wild West.\" It's definitely possible to set this up right now... if you have unlimited money. The tech's still not at the right price for the specs. More importantly, ideal bands're largely owned by corporations unwilling to lease at reasonable prices (if at all) or are otherwise allocated to stupid, irrelevant purposes. The major mobile companies have some excellent bands available to them, but local and regional WISPs basically have ~900MHz or go fuck yourself... the .11ah standard might be the needed improvement, though, if it can actually do what some are claiming. Right now, WISPs have the option of uselessly low-frequency signals (high latency, abysmal throughput), 900MHz (which can't carry much data as-is -- not nearly enough to be competitive), or uselessly high-frequency signals (abysmal signal penetration, while 2.4GHz has poor penetration and is terribly crowded by home/office routers, where WISP deployment would probably be disruptive). .... ahhh, damn... what was the topic?\n", "author": "Kluge Donator Legendary Offline Activity: 1218 Merit: 1011 "}, {"date": "2014-10-30 01:31:18", "content": "Unplug the internet cable, then you can stop bitcoin.\nSurprise!

My course of studies consists of theoretical elements of film (and other media) production, as well as practical ones. I have taken part in several film projects during my 3 years there on set and in the Marketing Department of a larger production.\nMy team consists of 4 students, doing their Master's Degree in \"Media Technics\", all have prior experience in practical film production and theoretical knowledge.\nOur campus is equipped with the most up to date devices and infrastructure neccessary for recording and editing movies. All of witch are available to us. Different film projects are currently being developed there which an able community of young film makers, that can contribute to this project if need arises.\nSo we got the Know How, the Equipment and the Support to make this documentary reality. The only thing missing is MONEY!\nTo stay with the spirit of the Bitcoin project, I decided to raise funds exclusively with Bitcoin from the community that it comes from in the most transparent and open way possible instead of asking private or governmental film promotion funds to give me the money under some restrictive licenses.\nHow much money do we need?\nTo make this movie as awesome as it can get, we need to collect about 10.000 EUR or 13.000 USD in BTC. With this money we can traveler to conferences, developers, entrepreneurs and miners all over the world! If we get less then that, the movie will still be cool, but not as many interesting people and places will be in it, so yeah, if this documentation shall reflect the international concentrated power of the Bitcoin project, we need to raise those funds!\nAsk me anything!\n1. Question: Who would you like to see on the Docu?\nSome Silk Road Dealer, the BIGGEST mining farms from within or Kim Dotcom?\nPlease make some suggestions!\nNominations so far:\nGavin Andresen\nAshton Kutcher\nAlan Reiner (Armory developer)\nBen Bernanke\nPirateat40\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nAssignments:\nGeneral advice:\nPls use best equipment available. Anything below 720i is not so likely to be included. If you have to, make sure the material is good;)\nLow resolution should only be considered if intended for some effect (e.g. surveillance camera, media res, etc.)\nAlso try not to shake too much while holding your device, use tripods if available or look for other structures to support your camera. Its always easier to film and turn away from the sun or other sources of light, then to turn towards it. If sound is recorded, pls make sure its clear of too much background noise, wind, or else and relevant things can be understood well. Use external microphones if available. No loss in recorded data can be brought back in post production. If resolution is bad, we cant \"turn it up\" afterwards, if you are too loud or too silent, your recording device won't pick it all up and lossy compression methods (see:\nwikipedia\n) should be avoided as well. Pls try to provide us with the best quality possible.\n-\nLIVE TRANSACTION\n(open for public, receiving submissions)\nMake a live Bitcoin transaction with someone far, far away! Take footage on both ends of the deal and also some impressions of the area [e.g. a pan across the skyline of the town you are in, a time-lapse cruise through your area from a subway or car window (can also be turned into time lapse from real time footage in post production) or from the top of some world famous monument)]!\nPost links below! Thread will be updated with submissions.\nBest ones will be picked and have a high chance to be put into final movie!\n-\nSPANISH INTERVIEW TRANSLATION\n(currently being worked on by\nJaques\n, please post if interested)\nWe need one or two translators of the interview shot with a 62 years old Bitcoin aficionado in Argentina. The footage has not yet been released and will remain secret till the making of is being released. To avoid leaking this super secret interview only one or two trusted individuals with great Spanish skills will be entrusted to translate and subtitle to whole interview (ca. 20 minutes). Successful candidates will also receive other benefits, as their contribution will be valued equal to a 5 BTC donation to the project (see\ndonation page\nfor list of privileges).\n-\nLEGAL ADVICE\n(open for public, please post in comments)\nPlease answer all questions in this thread:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=170854.0\nThere are a couple of legal questions that come with this project. I would like to ask you to help us out if you have any fact based knowledge. We cant afford to consult a lawyer for that and our legal department at uni is completely over worked, so pls help us out!\nWhen you try to answer these questions pls refer to them by citing the corresponding number and use articles of law whenever possible.\n1\nUnder what license should we publish our movie?\nI. It shall be the most open license possible. Our team and all contributors basically waive their rights to the material (except being the creators of the content of course), so others can freely aquire, edit, sell, broadcast, screen, possess and do whatever they want with it at no cost to them.\nII. Some licenses to look at:\nCreative Commons\n,\nCopyfree\n,\nCC0\n,\nWhatTheFuckyouwanttoPublicLicense\nIII. We have to make sure all sound tracks, video clips, art work or else contributed by supporters is also allowed to be treated under the same conditions as the work of our team. So absolutely no one can come in afterwards and claim royalties or legally prohibit the distribution of our movie in any jurisdiction.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content\nhttp://www.wtfpl.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wtfpl-strip.jpg\n2\nWHO has to sign a waiver of rights and WHAT has to be in it? Can anyone provide blanks?\nI. So far we gave a waiver to all people interviewed on camera, our team gets one, our supervisor at uni will get one and all people identifiable in miscellaneous shots, not part of a larger group were asked whether we can use their picture whith their consent on camera.\n3\nWe would like to use stock footage of different TV channels and other resources (anyone remember that Good Wife episode;)?) To use it in our open domain-like licensed movie will be difficult. Any ideas? Practice experience, work arounds? Please provide legal facts if you can!\n4\nFilming permits are to be aquired under different conditions everywhere. In most cases we make sure to either have them or to not be classified as a professional film crew under the specific conditions lined out for the locations in question. Lets say it turns out we were not allowed to film somewhere so after the movie is published some public servant stands up and demands additional payment, should we be concerned?\n5\nUnder what jurisdiction should we put our movie (if any)? After all it will be filmed in many different countries and there are different (copyright) laws in every one of those.\n-\nSENT US SATOSHI NAKAMOTO!\n(open for public, receiving submissions)\nWe will talk about Bitcoin's mysterious creator and maybe visit some of his early peers to tell his story (or what we know about it). For that, we'll need a lot of cut away footage from him. If you have any ideas on how to portait him take a camera and start to film!\nWe need footage of him basically being himself in any way you see him: sitting in a sushi bar, using the subway, sitting in front of his screen, devicing Bitcoin, being a NSA spy, earning a shit ton of money,..\nAny scenes that you can imagine we can use. In this case its not even important to record superb sound because we will most likely lay music over it or to use a good camera because those \"memories\" will fall out of the standard look of the movie anyway.\nThis is your chance to make yourself an idol of\nSatoshi Cyber Christ\n. Please post or send us your ideas and footage and we can put you in the credits for ever lasting fame!\n0.1_BTC\nAle Janda\n(First Non-Anonymous Donation)\n1.0_BTC\nTechnomage\n1.5123319_BTC\nLocalBitcoins.com\n2.0_BTC\nallkindsofshit\n10.0_BTC\nBitcoin.de\n10.0_BTC\nMike Gogulski\n(\napp.bitlaundry.com\n,\nbitcoinlaundry.com\n)\n1.0_BTC\nmolecular\n13.9645423_BTC\nBitcoin 100\n1.75_BTC\nChristopher J.

Then you can do justice to parts that otherwise get passed over too quickly.\nThis is indeed a proposition worthwhile pondering on. My initial plan was to have a frame story of a common Bitcoiner that tries to succeed in his quest, which could be anything from mining to starting a Business or organising a conference, etc. I would follow him around with the camera and while his story is used to tell his tale, the watcher can identify with him, feel for him, while different aspects of Bitcoin would be focused on, like anonymity, monetary regulation, the Bitcoin community with its various projects, always leading back to him to connect the different fields. Everything would of course be real as this is a documentary. So the Bitcoiner's story has to be a true story as well.\nNow with this proposition I see another approach to the movie. If I understand you correctly, you envision a short (30 min?) feature on lets say \"mining\", the next part of this larger Bitcoin series would be focused on \"Silk Road\" for example. This would of course result in a more thorough coverage of the topic(s) but would lack a narrative, which is the common Bitcoiner from my initial idea. It sounds more like a series for a pre educated audience, that already has a basic understanding of Bitcoin. My aspiration is to make movie, that gears towards a completely unexperienced audience to the common Bitcoin follower. I think by including the narrative structure of a main story one has more control over the arc of suspense and can create a more captivating movie. I am planning on making a 45 minute feature about Bitcoin. The topic maybe too dry/complicated to grasp for the inexperienced to keep them watching over the entire length. Therefore the element of a frame story (golden yarn) is neccessary in my opinion.\nBut why not making both? The two structures, the full length one for the casual viewer and an in-depth one for the eagerly interested could both be realized and use footage from one another. In the end of production of the 45 min. one, we will have hours and hours of material from many different areas, that could easily recombined to make shorter features of maybe 20-30 minute parts that will focus on specific aspects and give a clearer image. This is the beauty of this project, it could provide a repository for so many movies to come and everyone is invited to make their own.\nFree to use, free to share and distribute!\n", "author": "Spekulatius Legendary Offline Activity: 1022 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2013-03-09 23:17:24", "content": "SO WHAT'S WITH QUESITION # 1?\n1.

If you do attend, I suggest getting the cheapest plane tickets for two and hook up with some Bitcoiner near there, staying at their home. No more than two guys should be needed for said event, one of which is your camera guy.\nSuggestion: Document where and how every bitcoin is spend, taking screenshots of the blockchain as proof, incorporating it into the documentary somehow.\nI love the idea of somehow you interview one of the hackers or scammers.\n~Bruno K~\n", "author": "Phinnaeus Gage Legendary Offline Activity: 1372 Merit: 1001 Bitcoin: An Idea Worth Spending "}, {"date": "2013-03-14 05:53:21", "content": "What you guys should do is a kickstarter clone of your page.  If people knew they would be getting a physical DVD they'd 'donate' $60.  If some of the richer bitcoineers on here were offered a producers credit they'd donate\nBTC\n200.

(and dont mind my Spanish\n)\nIf you paid for a Spanish program from psy, there's a scammer tag section on this forum. Also, Dank is the best musician I can think of on this forum. I just came up with an interesting idea while penning that last sentence. Image Dank as a busker, playing(?) his guitar, accepting donations only in bitcoins, whereupon if he reaches a certain amount, he'll stop playing. Otherwise the song(?) remains the same.\n&lt;end humor&gt;\nSeeing that there's four of you, and the documentary's based on a financial aspect, what better place to start it than here?\nAfter filming a similar work, head on over to Bank on Dave and try to convince him to start accepting/dealing-in Bitcoin. Explain to him that you're making a documentary and looking for a short term Bitcoin loan.\nFor starters, everything you guys are doing now that's Bitcoin related should be filmed, for it's all part of the project.\nBack to the Bitcoin 100 proposal.\nCurrently, we have ~$20,000 worth of bitcoins setting in our coffer. All we're asking in return for a $1,000 donation is a link on your official site and a tiny mention in the credits, something you would do for some other entity willing to donate a chuck of change. You would do it for Bank on Dave, wouldn't you?\nBut I'm willing to go one better--a lot better. But it would entail a little effort on your part, but worth the footage. I'll explain in sec, but first the following.\nOriginally, Bitcoin 100's intent was to dole out 100 BTC to any non-profit that would simple embed a Bitcoin donation option onto their website, provided they met a couple simple criteria. Four have done so, and $400 to $1,200 worth of coins were donated to them, depending on the exchange rate at the time. The purpose was, and still is, to further the awareness of Bitcoin. Now some of those early entities we approached declined when bitcoins traded in the single digits (US dollar speaking). Now at $46 a coin, they may have second thoughts seeing that there's $4,600 to be had.\nBut I foreseen this as a possibility early on, thus suggestion that at some arbitrary amount like $20 per coin should be the cutting off point for the 100 BTC donation. Since we've surpassed that mark, and Bitcoin is obtaining more exposure, it's time to cut that figure down to $1,000 per charitable organization, but not lower, as I've mentioned a few times already in Bitcoin 100's main thread.\nAnd what more venerable cause then your endeavor to start, leaving us with ~$19,000.\nHere's what I propose. First accept the $1,000 donation. Then seek out an NPO/NGO willing to embed a Bitcoin donation option onto their respective website, and they will receive a $1,000 donation. For your efforts, $500 worth of bitcoin will be transferred to your coffer.\nIdeally, it'll be nice to be filming your efforts, showing beforehand how easy this sounds, but hopefully you encounter brick walls which makes good cinema.\nDo this 12 times total, and you'll receive an additional $6,000 on top of the $1,000 we hopefully gave you, leaving $1,000 in our coffer at the current exchange rate. Hypothetically if the exchange rate remains the same after your team/network-of-friends garner the 12 non-profits, we'll give you that $1,000 as a bonus. At the end of the day, our coffer will be empty and your (ours, as in bitcoiners) documentary is well on its way. I'm sure you brainiacs can figure out a way to weave the story line in on how you had to give away thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins so that you can make this fine documentary.\nThink about it! It'll probably be the first ever documentary funded via the giving away of money opposed to the trying of obtain it. And it would only take some effort on your team's part, of which you should be able to collect some fine footage during the process, provided camera's in hand.\nFuck it! Make it only 10 NPO/NGO's you need to obtain at $1K a pop, and the rest is yours. And if the exchange rate goes higher in the coming weeks, of which it may, I pretty sure you'll have your $13K from us. We'll still dole it out at $1,000 per charity and $500 to you, with the balance transferred once the tenth charity is obtained.\nImage the footage when you receive a yes on that tenth entity. The jumping up with joy knowing that you have earned the money hoped for to make said documentary.\nWhat we get out of the deal is eleven more non-profit entities (ten, plus yourself) who've added Bitcoin donation options onto their websites. That's all we ever wanted in the first place. And if the exchange rate wouldn't have risen, the best we would have hoped for was only ~4 more with the current amount of bitcoins we have on hand.\nThe way I see it, it's a win/win for all parties concerned. The worse aspect of the entire deal is that there would be some effort on your team's (and your network of friends/associates) part. But the filming of said effort would make the quest that much more valuable.\nIf luck is on your side, you may even approach $20K worth of bitcoins.\nThe other option is doing it the old fashion way getting a dollar here, a dollar there, and in no time (no pun intended) you've have a\nsawbuck\n.\nLet me know what you think.\n~Bruno K~\n", "author": "Phinnaeus Gage Legendary Offline Activity: 1372 Merit: 1001 Bitcoin: An Idea Worth Spending "}, {"date": "2013-03-16 10:36:41", "content": "And if you accept the above offer, during the interim of you obtaining the ten non-profits we obtain one some other way, we'll still shoot you $500 worth of bitcoins, thus one less you have to secure.

(and feel free to call me Bruno if you desire) Given the above, I'm going to take the liberty to fine-tune the original proposal, with hopefully at the end of the day not take much, if any, moneys--as first outlined--off the table, and maybe even securing more funds along the way.\nWith that, you're pretty much assured the $1,000 USD from\nBitcoin 100\nto further along this endeavor.\nWhat I believe is paramount is that the ten NPO/NGOs we obtain receive as much prominent billing as possible, i.e., credits in the documentary (hopefully not in fast scroll mode), and links on your website, chiefly come to mind. Shouldn't need more than that. Please don't concern yourself with billing\nBitcoin 100\nunless we deserve credit(s).\nTherefore, the adjusted proposal (outlined shortly) is predicated on a commitment from you in regard to the above--prominently showcasing ten new non-profits (not any previously obtained prior to this tentative agreement).\nWould you have any suggestions for organizations that match Bitcoin100's apiration and could also be on the Docu?\nPossibly.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64504.0\nkenija2012 was one of the first NPOs we funded, and I'm sure those doctors may have live footage, taken while in Kenya.\nhttp://kenijaodprava.blogspot.si/2012/10/18/povzetek/\nAnother example will come to mind later, or perhaps a new entity will manifest itself, rising up for the occasion. Of course, the better the human interest storyline, the better the final cut would be.\nFrom the top of my head, I can think of all the local\nhackspaces\nthat we will visit. Would they qualify for Bitcoin100?\nProbably not. Not because of who or what they are, but because of their reach, with most functioning at the local level. An umbrella organization of said group would suffice, provided they are not already accepting bitcoins as a donation option.\nThey do seem like a fine group of folks, where a member or two may be closely connected to some charitable organization which may qualify though. But we won't know unless they're asked. Hint! Hint!\n2nd idea\n(just hit me over the head): What about organizations that may accept Bitcoin, but when we interview them first they are more likely to decline, so we show their statements as a little side story and as the plot progresses, they are shown again with footage from our second visit by which they have already accepted Bitcoin and talk about how cool it is;) ?\nOr at the very least, they reluctantly accept the offer (filmed), with a follow up video prior to the footage hitting the edit floor.\nOnce one of these ten accept, we'll do our best to work with them as they start requesting donations via Bitcoin. This will be more true if one particular entity is pose to be filmed more so than some other(s). Once we're made aware of such a fact, it'll be easier to shoot more coins their way, thus making the outcome more favorable, albeit a tad contrived.\nNow that I've address your response, allow me to outline the next step(s) below the fold.\nThe New Proposal\nDon't worry, for the changes are not too draconian. In fact, some may prove better, outweighing any negativity.\nThe first major change is that I will take lead control of the fund raising drive as it relates to\nBitcoin 100's\nefforts in the amassing of the majority of the funding for the documentary. I'll be starting a separate thread for the occasion. In fact, there'll be two threads, for it'll be a two-step process. You'll understand why in a bit (almost penned sec).\nAnother major change will be in the time frame to accomplish this task. Originally, I penned a 60-90 day max window, with your team footing the majority of the labor. Seeing from your post, and should of considered it myself earlier, you'll probably be too pressed for time to take on added burdens.\nThe new time frame will be only 30 days to accomplish said task, provided the wafers leave the FAB as scheduled.\n(couldn't resist injecting humor) This quickening should come as a blessing for a myriad of reasons.\nIn essence, I'll be setting up a 30 day donation drive/challenge starting on the first day of April (probably sooner), ending on the 30th (locked deadline). This is what thread two (mentioned above) will consist of. Thread one (started immediately) will consist of garnering support from various viable entities, willing to donate $500(?) each at the end of April if\nBitcoin 100\npulls through.\n(getting tired, but hope the gist came through--elaboration will be provided in said thread, and touch upon further below)\nQuick aside: Upon a second/third read of the quoted post, I wanted to let you know that in no way are we (am I) trying to dictate to you how, or what, to weave into the documentary as it pertains to NGOs, et al. But I will start a third thread in the Projects sections for you to peruse, asking of the members what they would like to see in the doc. Therefore, all the suggestions would be in a single thread, whereupon you'll maintain the official thread (perhaps this is it), and I'll man the donation arm, again as it only relates to\nBitcoin 100\nand none of the other funding.\nNo other addresses will be set up to collect donations by me in The Bitcoin Documentary's name. Only the address you've provided will be utilized.\nOne last major change, and that's the maximum dollar amount aspect. I've previous stated that all the funds currently residing in our coffers would go toward the making of the documentary provided a certain criteria's met, $10K of which going to actual charities. One aspect of the criteria was having your team doing most of the legwork. Since that is no longer the case due to it being impractical, I have bestowed that burden unto myself. That act alone causes us to no longer guarantee the entire pool.\nThe only way you would receive less than $10K from\nBitcoin 100\nis if the exchange rate spirals downward before the end of April, and the grand total did not come to $20K USD. If that'll be the case, all of the funds would still be allocated for this cause with the exception of a 1 BTC.\nThe maximum now that we'll transfer out for this project will only be $20,000, whereas before it had a potential of being $20K+. It equates to $10,000 USD max that you'll end up with, broken down the same way as before: namely, for each charity embedding a Bitcoin donation button onto their respective website, they'll receive $1,000, and you'll immediately receive $500; if at the end of April all ten are obtained, another $4,000 heads your way ($1K (initial) + $5K ($500 X 10) + $4K (remainder) = $10K (total); plus the dollar sum from all those betting, so to speak, that we can't do it (e.g., $500 per entity times 10 minimum equals $5K); and hopefully another $1K from The Bitcoin Foundation pledging (again, betting, so to speak) that we can't get 10 charities before the end of April\nAND\nget at least ten entities to pledge\nAND\nget at least $5K pledged from as many entities needed to surpass said figure.\nBasically, that's what thread one will consist of--garnering support prior to augment the main drive (thread two). If I did the math correctly, with all the goals met there'll be no less than $16,000 I hope to raise for this crazy documentary idea, produced by four (five) wild and crazy guys with accents.\nAgain, just assure me that you'll show prominence to ten charities if we secure them. If so, I'm moving forward with what's outlined above, unless you believe something needs addressing.\n~Bruno K~\n", "author": "Phinnaeus Gage Legendary Offline Activity: 1372 Merit: 1001 Bitcoin: An Idea Worth Spending "}, {"date": "2013-03-20 21:33:37", "content": "Haven't heard too many suggestions so far\nAs promised in my mega post above, I created a thread for just this very thing:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=12.0\nI, in now way, am connected with this endeavor, but am doing everything within my power to help them bring this venerable documentary to fruition.\n~Bruno K~\n", "author": "Phinnaeus Gage Legendary Offline Activity: 1372 Merit: 1001 Bitcoin: An Idea Worth Spending "}, {"date": "2013-03-21 00:01:38", "content": "UPDATE:\nFirst Pic from Vienna interviews\nThis pic comes fresh from the cam and has\nNOT\nbeen edited yet!\nSo please be patient and check back in a couple of days for the first brushed up sneak peeks of our Vienna interviews!\nAlways first in our\nblog\n!\n", "author": "Spekulatius Legendary Offline Activity: 1022 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2013-03-21 00:16:51", "content": "Haven't heard too many suggestions so far\nAs promised in my mega post above, I created a thread for just this very thing:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=12.0\nI, in now way, am connected with this endeavor, but am doing everything within my power to help them bring this venerable documentary to fruition.\n~Bruno K~\nThanx Bruno,\nIll give it another Mega read tomorrow;)\nToo tired right now, but I like it.\nCheers,\n★☆★Johannes★☆★\nDirector/Producer\n", "author": "Spekulatius Legendary Offline Activity: 1022 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2013-03-21 05:43:44", "content": "Just a suggestion, so please feel free to take it or leave it.

As you've quoted me above\n(in bold)\nin regard to this tier system of yours, I feel it best to dole any perks achieved via our funding efforts to those we may obtain to donating to your cause either directly or indirectly.\nFor instance, the entities I get on board to post Challenge Grants. They may be more incline to accept said rewards, perhaps donating in such a manner to reap the maximum benefits. Remember, I'm gunning for at least 10 people to pledge no less than $5,000 USD total, coupled with The Bitcoin Foundation to grant another $1,000 USD, IFF I obtain 10 new non-profits before the end of April.\nThis way you would receive no less than $16,000 USD worth of bitcoins into your coffer. As you well know, I'm already less than an inch there, since you've already received 1/16th of the my goal, with only 15/16 left to go. Now, if I were in Germany, the task at hand would be even smaller, for I would be measuring it in cm, assuming a cm is shorter than an inch.\nOne more thing that I don't want to take for granted. Those 10+ entities I've been speaking of should get proper billing as well, similar to the 10 non-profits I bring on board. In fact it's imperative that this is arranged, for it's a major selling point for me to obtain those entities. I'm sure that BitPay, Coinabul, Butterfly Labs, Mt. Gox, Memory Dealers, Satoshi Dice, et al., would love to see their names on the big screen.\n(apologies if I left off major entities on the list, but was penning from memory off the top of my...let me rephrase that)\n~Bruno K~\n", "author": "Phinnaeus Gage Legendary Offline Activity: 1372 Merit: 1001 Bitcoin: An Idea Worth Spending "}, {"date": "2013-03-25 14:12:43", "content": "I believe it's a legal requirement, mandated by international treaties, that any such documentary begins with Pink Floyd's \"Money\"\nFirst the silent typing opening, then after the first scene has ended \"Money\" with the opening credits and some kind of 'sequence'.

Yes, we are getting our hands dirty and talk to the people on the bleeding edge of the Bitcoin cosmos!

Cant give you much details on that also atm, sry but Im sure u understand. We will not get into contact with any SR dealers or users before proper protection is worked out for our team or potential interview partners, but rest assured that we will not spare this aspect.\nRegarding those \"random people\", you have been seing introduced: they are actual experts in their fields and can with proper background describe the multiple facets of Bitcoin from their perspective, may it be anonymity, economy or legal aspects. As my documentary parts into a describing/theoretical part and a real life story (see main character) that the viewer can follow throughout the movie both have their place and reason to be interviewed/followed by the camera.\nI hope this clears things up a bit.

Governments are sneakier than that, with more restrictions placed on what they dislike (or are indifferent toward) each year - but restrictions which may not be obvious. Net uhhhh... non-Neutrality poses a major risk, where ISPs in some countries do already cripple bandwidth permitted to IP addresses not in a \"fast lane whitelist.\" When whitelists are involved, shutting down cryptocoins is more viable, even if cryptocurrencies aren't the target, just collateral damage. It may result in special \"fast-lane VPS\" companies (where they're basically just subleasing their \"fast lane\" license with the major ISPs), where they'd sell (likely at a huge premium over current costs) service to NFPs, generous individuals, and corporations for transaction and block relays for the good of the network. This would likely cause a drastic decline in the number of full nodes operating and may lead to service degradation for those using full clients. It may also pose a security risk insofar as a weak relay infrastructure could allow the few remaining relays to operate on a transaction whitelist or blacklist, effectively allowing them to control who can use Bitcoin, possibly even charging for tx relay capability if there're high-enough costs associated with running full nodes.\nService disruption through ISP QoS could also come from arbitrarily increasing latency between p2p connections, which would disrupt the currently fast and robust flow of the transaction queue as well as decreasing mining profitability where implemented. None of this would kill Bitcoin, but it would make it more difficult to use and could possibly cause financial losses in cases of time-sensitive transactions (and mining). Similarly, a \"great wall\" would be a PitA for full users to deal with, but Bitcoin would still work.\nIn pretty much every serious attack possibility, the best counter-measure is a decentralized mesh Internet returning the Internet to the \"Wild West.\" It's definitely possible to set this up right now... if you have unlimited money. The tech's still not at the right price for the specs. More importantly, ideal bands're largely owned by corporations unwilling to lease at reasonable prices (if at all) or are otherwise allocated to stupid, irrelevant purposes. The major mobile companies have some excellent bands available to them, but local and regional WISPs basically have ~900MHz or go fuck yourself... the .11ah standard might be the needed improvement, though, if it can actually do what some are claiming. Right now, WISPs have the option of uselessly low-frequency signals (high latency, abysmal throughput), 900MHz (which can't carry much data as-is -- not nearly enough to be competitive), or uselessly high-frequency signals (abysmal signal penetration, while 2.4GHz has poor penetration and is terribly crowded by home/office routers, where WISP deployment would probably be disruptive). .... ahhh, damn... what was the topic?\n", "author": "Kluge Donator Legendary Offline Activity: 1218 Merit: 1011 "}, {"date": "2014-10-30 01:31:18", "content": "Unplug the internet cable, then you can stop bitcoin.\nSurprise!
