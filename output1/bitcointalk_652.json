Namely, consensus on valid blocks in the block chain. We can use this new technology to arrive at consensus on literally anything, and so it only makes sense that we use it to arrive at consensus on the BlockSize debate.\nWhat we need is to define a CLEAR PROCESS by which this is done, as it will need to be done again and again in the future. Perhaps the first part of this CLEAR PROCESS that needs to be defined is what we define as Consensus? Is it 75%? Is it 90%? Is it 95%? 99%?\nWe can model this process after the following:\nStep One:\nStonewalling size increase changes is just as much as a Ben Bernanke/FOMC move as increasing the hard limit by hard fork.  Jeff Garzik, Developer\nThe issue to be decided is whether or not, and how to increase the block size. Relevant information might include the fact that there is no deep philosophical or technical reason for the current limit. Satoshi implemented the current limit as a temporary anti-spam measure under the assumption that the limit would need to be raised eventually.\nWith the current block size limit the Bitcoin network can only sustain less than around 260,000 transactions per day. If we look at the trend in increase of transaction volume we can project that we will run out of capacity as early as Fall 2016.\nThe solutions to this problem include increasing the block size now before this capacity limit is reached, waiting until we reach the limit to increase the block size, or never increasing the block size and relying on \"payment channel\" solutions such as Lightening Network and BlockStream.\nGavin Andreson's BIP101 essentially acted as our Step One, introducing the problem to be solved to the community at large and presenting a single possible solution that serves as the catalyst to jump start the debate, ultimately leading to a consensus conclusion. (probably not XT)\nStep Two:\nProposed Solutions to this problem include:\nBIP 100\nPeriodically change the limit based on observed block size, but never go larger than 32MB.\nBIP 101\nIncrease to 8 MB on January 11, 2016, and double the limit every two years.\nBIP 102\nIncrease to 2 MB on November 11, 2015.\nBIP 103\nIncrease by 17.7% annually until 2063.\nAnd also of course no increase and relying solely on \"payment channel\" solutions.\n\"If [the niche of digital gold] is what Bitcoin users want, then they should keep the limit, and perhaps even decrease it. But if Bitcoin users want to be a payment system, then up it must go.\" - Vitalik Buterin\nStep Three:\nEmerging proposals seem to be a compromise between the Pr0-XT camp and the Anti-XT camp. Such a compromise likely consists of simply increasing the block size via Bitcoin Core, avoiding all of the \"extra features\" that come with XT but satisfying the palpable call for increased block size.\nStep Four:\nWe are currently in-between the Step Two and STep Three Stages, perhaps coming close to Step Four soon, in which the emerging proposals are being refined and amended.\nStep Five:\nIn step five we should test for agreement. For example, BIP101 on Core which is to Increase the Blocksize to 8 MB and double it every two years. To find out if we have agreement we will put the proposal to the community.\nIf someone has a BLOCK against the proposal they are stating that they have a fundamental disagreement with this proposal which needs to be resolved. BLOCK's should be taken very seriously and also should be made with caution. A legitimate BLOCK against the proposal should stop it from being implemented. All BLOCK's should be listed and hashed out among the community so that amendments can be made to the proposal that address the issues raised in the BLOCKs.\nA STAND ASIDE is a person who does not support the proposal entirely but who does not want to hinder a consensus decision and so does not stand in the way of it's supporters. STAND ASIDEs realize the harm in splitting the community is greater than the harm of the implementation of the proposal they disagree with.\nRESERVATIONS are when a person supports the proposal but has some RESERVATIONS he is concerned with, but acknowledges these are minimal enough to let the proposition pass.\nAn AGREEMENT is when a person supports the proposal and is willing to implement it.\nCONSENSUS is reached when we have virtually zero blocks, not too many stand asides and reservations, and active agreement at or around the agreed upon consensus level, such as 90%.\nWe can do step five on the block chain by voting for the proposal with hash power as adamstgBit has proposed here:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1160035.0\nStep Six:\nOnce we have the proposal, all that is left is to implement it.\nThe beauty of this method is that theoretically we do not have winners vs losers, or teams doing battle, or a war on our hands. We are working together to reach the best solution that we all agree on. We do not have 75% losers and 25% losers who threaten to do the worst thing possible and split bitcoin into two competing chains, instead we have a near 100% consensus that is a compromise between competing solutions and is agreed upon by all to be the best possible solution.\nThis is how we solve the current debate, and also all future debates that are sure to come.\n", "views": 764, "author": "BitProdigy Full Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 100 We Are The New Wealthy Elite, Gentlemen ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Consensus Decision Process\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-08-24 05:26:28", "content": "You're a prodigy.

What I've done so far:\nseparated model/view/content\neliminated most code repetition\nimproved readability across the board\nadded a templating system (smarty)\ncreated improved abstraction layers for caching, database and bitcoind RPC API\nmoved various hardwired configurations that were interwoven in various spots in the code into a single configuration file\neliminated use of gotos and globals\nfixed the most glaring performance issues\nUnfortunately I ran out of time before I could finish the rewrite and release the new code with all the major issues ironed out. I plan on getting back to this as soon as possible but in the meantime it'll probably be better to have the code out there where it might do some good rather than keep it hidden away on my hard disk.\nWhy the delay? When I started the project I didn't take into account the state of the complexity of the old code and that before I could jump into the code I'd have to spend time migrating the site to a new server that could handle the load and wasn't about to run out of SSD disk space. Without the new server blockexplorer would have stopped working around March.\nAlso getting the code into shape was more work then I had anticipated. I nearly finished the rewrite but was then forced to put blockexplorer.com development on the back burner around May and get back to my main \"job\" developing TurnKey Linux. We had another release coming out and I had already given blockexplorer more time than I had originally planned.\nAs many of you know Michael Marquardt AKA Theymos originally wrote Bitcoin Block Explorer, the first web based blockchain exploration tool. Unfortunately, with everything else he's got going on, including being an admin for Bitcointalk, he didn't have time to continue maintaining and developing the site so when I offered to take the site off his hands and turn it into an open source project he passed the torch to me:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1727.msg1539613#msg1539613\nUnfortunately I don't have that much free time either - since I usually have my hands full developing TurnKey Linux. But I figured I had at least enough time to liberate the site code and bootstrap it into an open source project, by the Bitcoin community, for the Bitcoin community. blockchain.info has done a great job but it isn't open source and I think it would be contrary to the spirit of Bitcoin to give any one site a monopoly in this area.\n", "views": 1275, "author": "liraz Jr. Member Offline Activity: 30 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlockExplorer.com rewrite open sourced and on GitHub - help wanted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-08-31 21:52:48", "content": "The old PHP code is retired, Blockexplorer.com is now powered by a lightly modified version of BitPay Insight:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1167528.new#new\n", "author": "liraz Jr. Member Offline Activity: 30 Merit: 0 "}], "date": "2013-08-13 15:56:56"}, {"content": "American Teen Sentenced to 11 Years for Helping ISIS with Bitcoin\n", "views": 1352, "author": "the_poet Legendary Offline Activity: 1105 Merit: 1000 Bitcoin accepted here ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is the kind of news that gives Bitcoin a shady reputation...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-08-30 10:09:25", "content": "Helping terrorist should always end like this.

Then think of embarrassing purchases, purchases from unbanked countries, purchases where anonymity is an issue (VPNs), and illegal purchases. Now we are talking serious utility relative to the other options.\nTo anyone who still entertains this notion that Bitcoin is a currency right now, let me explain something: Currency requires currentness. Currentness means that it is generally accepted. If Bitcoin were generally accepted, the price would be at least $100,000 per coin already.\nSo how does Bitcoin proceed? Certainly not from brick and mortar adoption, nor even from Amazon adopting it. It starts with the applications where it can provide the highest marginal benefit: black markets, evading capital controls, hiding/\"offshoring\" wealth, other \"store of value\" applications, etc. Then as these have driven the price higher the infrastructure follows and then in myriad incremental (and sometimes sudden) ways new applications become feasible and are invented. VPNs, porn, remittances, and a mix of the familiar and radically new prospects that everyone here is familiar with. All this happens in a virtuous cycle with price, mining, venture capital investment, infrastructure rollout, increased trust, better image, better user-friendliness, the overcoming of security obstacles, more interest from coders and financial people, etc.\nEventually merchants start start finding that Bitcoin spending during bubbles is a fair size of their payment pie, and then the cost savings raise eyebrows, they offer incentives for payment in BTC, and things really start snowballing for merchant adoption. Finally, at the very end, brick-and-mortar stores accept it simply because a sizable number of people already use it daily for online purchases.\nMost importantly, all through this process investors are buying BTC not to enable purchases but to capitalize on the coming stages of adoption. They are buying based on that future promise. They're using Bitcoin, not as the currency that it should one day become, but as a store of value and investment that anticipates the day that it does have currentness and is a currency.\nJust because Bitcoin turned out to be better for the \"store of value\" function first is no reason to worry overly about the transactional function taking time to blossom - that's what investors are for. The ones that invest based on a sound assessment of Bitcoin's future potential serve as a proxy for actual present commercial adoption by boosting the price in the present to a degree commensurate with how likely commercial adoption will be to take hold in the future. To misunderstand this is to misunderstand investing itself, as well as to misconstrue much of what is happening in the Bitcoin world.\nRelated reading #1:\nThe Separation of Money and State\nAfter discussing the separation of church and state, Voorhees applied the philosophy of freedom of choice to money. The Shapeshift.io CEO claimed the freedom to choose your money is, for many people, more important than being able to choose a religion. He noted that a separation of money and state might be just as  if not more important than  freedom of religion:\nIt is that narrative of human development under which I believe that we now have other fights to fight, and I would say in the realm of Bitcoin it is mainly the separation of money and state. Money is absolutely as fundamental to our lives as religion, and for many people it is far more fundamental to their lives as religion. It affects how your life unfolds. The choices that you make about money dictate the ramifications of your life and those around you. And so, to have an institution like money so controlled by a central entity  by a monopoly  is absurd. It is immoral. We should get rid of it.\nThe idea of free markets is still somewhat popular in the United States, but this logic never seems to apply to money. Although many Republicans often espouse the benefits of the free market in various political speeches, essentially none of them bring up the idea of competing currencies. Most politicians in any part of the world seem rather selective when it comes to which markets are allowed to freely operate without government intervention.\nRelated reading #2:\nEconomics in One Lesson\nRead chapter 16: \"Stabilizing\" commodities -  PDF pages 112-118 (book pages 97-103).

Obviously people arent going to starve themselves because they are hoarding their money because they think it will be worth more the next year ad infinitum. Obviously they will spend money on food because they must eat, they will buy clothes, they will buy houses and cars, they will spend money on entertainment, etc. Saving will be a much more common and highly regarded thing in such a situation and debts and malinvestment will be minimized greatly, but spending will still occur necessarily. What we would see in such a society that was adjusted to a deflationary money supply is that in times of inflation, there would be hoarding.\nImagine you live in a society which has a deflationary money supply and so you know that prices go down a little bit every year at a predictable rate. Imagine it has been like this for several years for as long as you can remember and then suddenly prices go way up and your money has less purchasing power. Do you start spending money frantically as a result? No. Of course you dont. You hold out until prices fall back to a reasonable level and then you start spending as normal. Why would you start spending more when it costs you more money to buy less? It makes sense to spend more when it costs you less to buy more. In this way we can see that in a deflationary system, inflation actually encourages hoarding.\nImagine you live in that same society and suddenly prices go way down below the normal rate of price dropping. What do you do? Do you start hoarding all of your money? No. Of course you dont. You start spending money frantically so you can take advantage of the period of increased purchasing power before the prices go back up to a reasonable level. Why would you start hoarding all of your money during a time when prices for goods and services go down and your can buy much more with less money?

Namely, consensus on valid blocks in the block chain. We can use this new technology to arrive at consensus on literally anything, and so it only makes sense that we use it to arrive at consensus on the BlockSize debate.\nWhat we need is to define a CLEAR PROCESS by which this is done, as it will need to be done again and again in the future. Perhaps the first part of this CLEAR PROCESS that needs to be defined is what we define as Consensus? Is it 75%? Is it 90%? Is it 95%? 99%?\nWe can model this process after the following:\nStep One:\nStonewalling size increase changes is just as much as a Ben Bernanke/FOMC move as increasing the hard limit by hard fork.  Jeff Garzik, Developer\nThe issue to be decided is whether or not, and how to increase the block size. Relevant information might include the fact that there is no deep philosophical or technical reason for the current limit. Satoshi implemented the current limit as a temporary anti-spam measure under the assumption that the limit would need to be raised eventually.\nWith the current block size limit the Bitcoin network can only sustain less than around 260,000 transactions per day. If we look at the trend in increase of transaction volume we can project that we will run out of capacity as early as Fall 2016.\nThe solutions to this problem include increasing the block size now before this capacity limit is reached, waiting until we reach the limit to increase the block size, or never increasing the block size and relying on \"payment channel\" solutions such as Lightening Network and BlockStream.\nGavin Andreson's BIP101 essentially acted as our Step One, introducing the problem to be solved to the community at large and presenting a single possible solution that serves as the catalyst to jump start the debate, ultimately leading to a consensus conclusion. (probably not XT)\nStep Two:\nProposed Solutions to this problem include:\nBIP 100\nPeriodically change the limit based on observed block size, but never go larger than 32MB.\nBIP 101\nIncrease to 8 MB on January 11, 2016, and double the limit every two years.\nBIP 102\nIncrease to 2 MB on November 11, 2015.\nBIP 103\nIncrease by 17.7% annually until 2063.\nAnd also of course no increase and relying solely on \"payment channel\" solutions.\n\"If [the niche of digital gold] is what Bitcoin users want, then they should keep the limit, and perhaps even decrease it. But if Bitcoin users want to be a payment system, then up it must go.\" - Vitalik Buterin\nStep Three:\nEmerging proposals seem to be a compromise between the Pr0-XT camp and the Anti-XT camp. Such a compromise likely consists of simply increasing the block size via Bitcoin Core, avoiding all of the \"extra features\" that come with XT but satisfying the palpable call for increased block size.\nStep Four:\nWe are currently in-between the Step Two and STep Three Stages, perhaps coming close to Step Four soon, in which the emerging proposals are being refined and amended.\nStep Five:\nIn step five we should test for agreement. For example, BIP101 on Core which is to Increase the Blocksize to 8 MB and double it every two years. To find out if we have agreement we will put the proposal to the community.\nIf someone has a BLOCK against the proposal they are stating that they have a fundamental disagreement with this proposal which needs to be resolved. BLOCK's should be taken very seriously and also should be made with caution. A legitimate BLOCK against the proposal should stop it from being implemented. All BLOCK's should be listed and hashed out among the community so that amendments can be made to the proposal that address the issues raised in the BLOCKs.\nA STAND ASIDE is a person who does not support the proposal entirely but who does not want to hinder a consensus decision and so does not stand in the way of it's supporters. STAND ASIDEs realize the harm in splitting the community is greater than the harm of the implementation of the proposal they disagree with.\nRESERVATIONS are when a person supports the proposal but has some RESERVATIONS he is concerned with, but acknowledges these are minimal enough to let the proposition pass.\nAn AGREEMENT is when a person supports the proposal and is willing to implement it.\nCONSENSUS is reached when we have virtually zero blocks, not too many stand asides and reservations, and active agreement at or around the agreed upon consensus level, such as 90%.\nWe can do step five on the block chain by voting for the proposal with hash power as adamstgBit has proposed here:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1160035.0\nStep Six:\nOnce we have the proposal, all that is left is to implement it.\nThe beauty of this method is that theoretically we do not have winners vs losers, or teams doing battle, or a war on our hands. We are working together to reach the best solution that we all agree on. We do not have 75% losers and 25% losers who threaten to do the worst thing possible and split bitcoin into two competing chains, instead we have a near 100% consensus that is a compromise between competing solutions and is agreed upon by all to be the best possible solution.\nThis is how we solve the current debate, and also all future debates that are sure to come.\n", "views": 764, "author": "BitProdigy Full Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 100 We Are The New Wealthy Elite, Gentlemen ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Consensus Decision Process\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-08-24 05:26:28", "content": "You're a prodigy.

What I've done so far:\nseparated model/view/content\neliminated most code repetition\nimproved readability across the board\nadded a templating system (smarty)\ncreated improved abstraction layers for caching, database and bitcoind RPC API\nmoved various hardwired configurations that were interwoven in various spots in the code into a single configuration file\neliminated use of gotos and globals\nfixed the most glaring performance issues\nUnfortunately I ran out of time before I could finish the rewrite and release the new code with all the major issues ironed out. I plan on getting back to this as soon as possible but in the meantime it'll probably be better to have the code out there where it might do some good rather than keep it hidden away on my hard disk.\nWhy the delay? When I started the project I didn't take into account the state of the complexity of the old code and that before I could jump into the code I'd have to spend time migrating the site to a new server that could handle the load and wasn't about to run out of SSD disk space. Without the new server blockexplorer would have stopped working around March.\nAlso getting the code into shape was more work then I had anticipated. I nearly finished the rewrite but was then forced to put blockexplorer.com development on the back burner around May and get back to my main \"job\" developing TurnKey Linux. We had another release coming out and I had already given blockexplorer more time than I had originally planned.\nAs many of you know Michael Marquardt AKA Theymos originally wrote Bitcoin Block Explorer, the first web based blockchain exploration tool. Unfortunately, with everything else he's got going on, including being an admin for Bitcointalk, he didn't have time to continue maintaining and developing the site so when I offered to take the site off his hands and turn it into an open source project he passed the torch to me:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1727.msg1539613#msg1539613\nUnfortunately I don't have that much free time either - since I usually have my hands full developing TurnKey Linux. But I figured I had at least enough time to liberate the site code and bootstrap it into an open source project, by the Bitcoin community, for the Bitcoin community. blockchain.info has done a great job but it isn't open source and I think it would be contrary to the spirit of Bitcoin to give any one site a monopoly in this area.\n", "views": 1275, "author": "liraz Jr. Member Offline Activity: 30 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlockExplorer.com rewrite open sourced and on GitHub - help wanted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-08-31 21:52:48", "content": "The old PHP code is retired, Blockexplorer.com is now powered by a lightly modified version of BitPay Insight:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1167528.new#new\n", "author": "liraz Jr. Member Offline Activity: 30 Merit: 0 "}], "date": "2013-08-13 15:56:56"}, {"content": "American Teen Sentenced to 11 Years for Helping ISIS with Bitcoin\n", "views": 1352, "author": "the_poet Legendary Offline Activity: 1105 Merit: 1000 Bitcoin accepted here ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is the kind of news that gives Bitcoin a shady reputation...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-08-30 10:09:25", "content": "Helping terrorist should always end like this.

Then think of embarrassing purchases, purchases from unbanked countries, purchases where anonymity is an issue (VPNs), and illegal purchases. Now we are talking serious utility relative to the other options.\nTo anyone who still entertains this notion that Bitcoin is a currency right now, let me explain something: Currency requires currentness. Currentness means that it is generally accepted. If Bitcoin were generally accepted, the price would be at least $100,000 per coin already.\nSo how does Bitcoin proceed? Certainly not from brick and mortar adoption, nor even from Amazon adopting it. It starts with the applications where it can provide the highest marginal benefit: black markets, evading capital controls, hiding/\"offshoring\" wealth, other \"store of value\" applications, etc. Then as these have driven the price higher the infrastructure follows and then in myriad incremental (and sometimes sudden) ways new applications become feasible and are invented. VPNs, porn, remittances, and a mix of the familiar and radically new prospects that everyone here is familiar with. All this happens in a virtuous cycle with price, mining, venture capital investment, infrastructure rollout, increased trust, better image, better user-friendliness, the overcoming of security obstacles, more interest from coders and financial people, etc.\nEventually merchants start start finding that Bitcoin spending during bubbles is a fair size of their payment pie, and then the cost savings raise eyebrows, they offer incentives for payment in BTC, and things really start snowballing for merchant adoption. Finally, at the very end, brick-and-mortar stores accept it simply because a sizable number of people already use it daily for online purchases.\nMost importantly, all through this process investors are buying BTC not to enable purchases but to capitalize on the coming stages of adoption. They are buying based on that future promise. They're using Bitcoin, not as the currency that it should one day become, but as a store of value and investment that anticipates the day that it does have currentness and is a currency.\nJust because Bitcoin turned out to be better for the \"store of value\" function first is no reason to worry overly about the transactional function taking time to blossom - that's what investors are for. The ones that invest based on a sound assessment of Bitcoin's future potential serve as a proxy for actual present commercial adoption by boosting the price in the present to a degree commensurate with how likely commercial adoption will be to take hold in the future. To misunderstand this is to misunderstand investing itself, as well as to misconstrue much of what is happening in the Bitcoin world.\nRelated reading #1:\nThe Separation of Money and State\nAfter discussing the separation of church and state, Voorhees applied the philosophy of freedom of choice to money. The Shapeshift.io CEO claimed the freedom to choose your money is, for many people, more important than being able to choose a religion. He noted that a separation of money and state might be just as  if not more important than  freedom of religion:\nIt is that narrative of human development under which I believe that we now have other fights to fight, and I would say in the realm of Bitcoin it is mainly the separation of money and state. Money is absolutely as fundamental to our lives as religion, and for many people it is far more fundamental to their lives as religion. It affects how your life unfolds. The choices that you make about money dictate the ramifications of your life and those around you. And so, to have an institution like money so controlled by a central entity  by a monopoly  is absurd. It is immoral. We should get rid of it.\nThe idea of free markets is still somewhat popular in the United States, but this logic never seems to apply to money. Although many Republicans often espouse the benefits of the free market in various political speeches, essentially none of them bring up the idea of competing currencies. Most politicians in any part of the world seem rather selective when it comes to which markets are allowed to freely operate without government intervention.\nRelated reading #2:\nEconomics in One Lesson\nRead chapter 16: \"Stabilizing\" commodities -  PDF pages 112-118 (book pages 97-103).

Obviously people arent going to starve themselves because they are hoarding their money because they think it will be worth more the next year ad infinitum. Obviously they will spend money on food because they must eat, they will buy clothes, they will buy houses and cars, they will spend money on entertainment, etc. Saving will be a much more common and highly regarded thing in such a situation and debts and malinvestment will be minimized greatly, but spending will still occur necessarily. What we would see in such a society that was adjusted to a deflationary money supply is that in times of inflation, there would be hoarding.\nImagine you live in a society which has a deflationary money supply and so you know that prices go down a little bit every year at a predictable rate. Imagine it has been like this for several years for as long as you can remember and then suddenly prices go way up and your money has less purchasing power. Do you start spending money frantically as a result? No. Of course you dont. You hold out until prices fall back to a reasonable level and then you start spending as normal. Why would you start spending more when it costs you more money to buy less? It makes sense to spend more when it costs you less to buy more. In this way we can see that in a deflationary system, inflation actually encourages hoarding.\nImagine you live in that same society and suddenly prices go way down below the normal rate of price dropping. What do you do? Do you start hoarding all of your money? No. Of course you dont. You start spending money frantically so you can take advantage of the period of increased purchasing power before the prices go back up to a reasonable level. Why would you start hoarding all of your money during a time when prices for goods and services go down and your can buy much more with less money? In this way we can see that in a deflationary system, deflation actually encourages spending.\nIn an inherently deflationary system deflation encourages SPENDING and inflation encourages HOARDING.\n", "author": "BitProdigy Full Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 100 We Are The New Wealthy Elite, Gentlemen "}, {"date": "2015-08-31 07:05:07", "content": "I just thought about this in the reverse the other day. I like to pay my accounts in advance to build a credit balance for the time when I go on holiday in the Summer. In doing this, I have no hassles when I go on holiday and the bills gets paid from the credit.\nIf I did this with Bitcoin, I would run into trouble if the price dropped or crashed during my holiday and I would have to deposit more coins to make up the difference from the time I paid it, until the time when it gets deducted.\nThe opposite is also true when the price goes to the moon. My one payment might be enough to pay for two or three months, if it spiked. ^hmm^\n", "author": "Kakmakr Legendary Offline Activity: 1414 Merit: 1121 ★ ChipMixer | Bitcoin mixing service ★ "}], "date": "2015-08-28 23:46:20"}]}
