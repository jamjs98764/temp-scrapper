So if you can commander the GPS unit, then you can basically spoon feed false navigation information to the navigation center of these drones.\nBy compiling several years worth of research into custom-made software, Humphreys was able to do exactly that recently  and right before the DHS. By 2020, the Federal Aviation Administration expects to have as many as 30,000 drones flying over the United States. According to Humphreys, though, the FAA might want to make a few changes before they roll out a domestic UAV for local law enforcement agencies to use.\nIm a big proponent of bringing in drones to the national airspace. They are going to come and we might as well expect it. The question is, how can we bring them in reliably? he asks. And right now the dangers of bringing them in, before addressing this problem, is that someone on the ground could hack the drones and turn them into their own device, making them go to a different place or along a different path. So it could cause loss of life, it could cause collisions. But I hope that we can address the problem long before that happens.\n", "author": "Swordsoffreedom Hero Member Offline Activity: 952 Merit: 1000 Trumpin it up for a bit "}, {"date": "2014-08-08 10:30:44", "content": "No, its seems pointless...\n", "author": "noob2001 Hero Member Offline Activity: 602 Merit: 501 "}, {"date": "2014-08-08 10:48:59", "content": "You're smoking the good stuff, aren't you?\n", "author": "TheTruth4 Member Offline Activity: 108 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-08-08 11:21:15", "content": "You're smoking the good stuff, aren't you?\nDon't be jerk.

I promise that the first people/organization to do Act X (charitable/innovative stuff) will be guaranteed a donated pot of bitcoins.\n2. Let's say that my goal is that this pot reaches 50 Bitcoins, of which I will get 5% and the rest will be saved for Act X. Can people \"reserve\" a certain amount of their own coins for this pot, not lose them at once, and as soon as people have \"reserved\" 50 bitcoins in total, then the coins will be transferred? Before we reach 50 bitcoins, if people get impatient or regret their reserved donation, they can cancel their reservation and keep their coins?\n3. If we reach 50 bitcoins, could I then, with the approval of the open-source network to ensure that I stick to my deal and don't take more money than promised, take my 5%, and later in the future, when Act X happens, these people will get the whole pot (the open source network will ensure this), but as soon as 50 bitcoins are in the pot, none of the donators can take their coins back?

So as long as the bitcoin price shown is not exceedingly high compared to the average. then merchants can charge any price inbetween.\nalso you have to realise that bitcoin customers usually hold bitcoins for a few months, so they are usually in profit due to the deflationary nature of bitcoin. so customers should not be expecting discounts as thats just customer greed. merchants cant often discount prices, simply to hoard for the deflation to make them break even months later. instead they need to buy stock alot sooner, so in many cases of small 'mom and pop' stores they will want to be at break even or profit within a few days.\nonly large corporate merchants can afford to hoard for profit, thus offer discount. so i truly do hope all you bitcoiners that have the mindset that merchants should offer discounts as standard, to please take 'mom and pop' stores inability to discount into consideration.\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-08-05 15:39:26", "content": "A debit card you pay a % plus a fee sometimes up to $1 a swipe (more realistically $0.25)\n", "author": "farlack Legendary Offline Activity: 938 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-08-05 17:02:21", "content": "The fee they pay to payment processor can probably offset the credit card processing fee.\n", "author": "arbitrage001 Legendary Offline Activity: 1069 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-08-05 20:12:52", "content": "Maybe from the buyer's point of view.

So if you can commander the GPS unit, then you can basically spoon feed false navigation information to the navigation center of these drones.\nBy compiling several years worth of research into custom-made software, Humphreys was able to do exactly that recently  and right before the DHS. By 2020, the Federal Aviation Administration expects to have as many as 30,000 drones flying over the United States. According to Humphreys, though, the FAA might want to make a few changes before they roll out a domestic UAV for local law enforcement agencies to use.\nIm a big proponent of bringing in drones to the national airspace. They are going to come and we might as well expect it. The question is, how can we bring them in reliably? he asks. And right now the dangers of bringing them in, before addressing this problem, is that someone on the ground could hack the drones and turn them into their own device, making them go to a different place or along a different path. So it could cause loss of life, it could cause collisions. But I hope that we can address the problem long before that happens.\n", "author": "Swordsoffreedom Hero Member Offline Activity: 952 Merit: 1000 Trumpin it up for a bit "}, {"date": "2014-08-08 10:30:44", "content": "No, its seems pointless...\n", "author": "noob2001 Hero Member Offline Activity: 602 Merit: 501 "}, {"date": "2014-08-08 10:48:59", "content": "You're smoking the good stuff, aren't you?\n", "author": "TheTruth4 Member Offline Activity: 108 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-08-08 11:21:15", "content": "You're smoking the good stuff, aren't you?\nDon't be jerk.

I promise that the first people/organization to do Act X (charitable/innovative stuff) will be guaranteed a donated pot of bitcoins.\n2. Let's say that my goal is that this pot reaches 50 Bitcoins, of which I will get 5% and the rest will be saved for Act X. Can people \"reserve\" a certain amount of their own coins for this pot, not lose them at once, and as soon as people have \"reserved\" 50 bitcoins in total, then the coins will be transferred? Before we reach 50 bitcoins, if people get impatient or regret their reserved donation, they can cancel their reservation and keep their coins?\n3. If we reach 50 bitcoins, could I then, with the approval of the open-source network to ensure that I stick to my deal and don't take more money than promised, take my 5%, and later in the future, when Act X happens, these people will get the whole pot (the open source network will ensure this), but as soon as 50 bitcoins are in the pot, none of the donators can take their coins back?

So as long as the bitcoin price shown is not exceedingly high compared to the average. then merchants can charge any price inbetween.\nalso you have to realise that bitcoin customers usually hold bitcoins for a few months, so they are usually in profit due to the deflationary nature of bitcoin. so customers should not be expecting discounts as thats just customer greed. merchants cant often discount prices, simply to hoard for the deflation to make them break even months later. instead they need to buy stock alot sooner, so in many cases of small 'mom and pop' stores they will want to be at break even or profit within a few days.\nonly large corporate merchants can afford to hoard for profit, thus offer discount. so i truly do hope all you bitcoiners that have the mindset that merchants should offer discounts as standard, to please take 'mom and pop' stores inability to discount into consideration.\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-08-05 15:39:26", "content": "A debit card you pay a % plus a fee sometimes up to $1 a swipe (more realistically $0.25)\n", "author": "farlack Legendary Offline Activity: 938 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-08-05 17:02:21", "content": "The fee they pay to payment processor can probably offset the credit card processing fee.\n", "author": "arbitrage001 Legendary Offline Activity: 1069 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-08-05 20:12:52", "content": "Maybe from the buyer's point of view.

I'll make sure to get in touch if I ever need something of that caliber.\nAs for the \"Bitcoin Man\" costume, it wouldn't be too hard (the jacket, pants, and cape at least). The difficulty would come from getting the logo all over...I could silk screen it, I suppose, or use Spoonflower.com (probably easier, cheaper, and better looking).
