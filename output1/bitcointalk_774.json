The setup as described in the OP would really not save anything on labor costs as stores would still need to employ people to make sure everything has been paid for and that there is nothing that would be a risk to the company (for example a double spend attack).\nOne risk that has not been mentioned is that someone could potentially send a TX that is not likely to be confirmed by the miners (for example a very large transaction with no fee) and then use inputs from that TX to fund all the TXs that pay for each of the goods. Since the store would normally be relying on a number of 0/unconfirmed TXs this original TX would likely not be noticed/unacceptable.

The setup as described in the OP would really not save anything on labor costs as stores would still need to employ people to make sure everything has been paid for and that there is nothing that would be a risk to the company (for example a double spend attack).\nOne risk that has not been mentioned is that someone could potentially send a TX that is not likely to be confirmed by the miners (for example a very large transaction with no fee) and then use inputs from that TX to fund all the TXs that pay for each of the goods. Since the store would normally be relying on a number of 0/unconfirmed TXs this original TX would likely not be noticed/unacceptable. On the other hand if someone were to pay for everything at once then the store would only need to look at one TX to judge the risk as to if it is likely the TX is safe to accept with 0/unconfirmed status.\n", "author": "Window2Wall Full Member Offline Activity: 192 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-10-19 20:59:39", "content": "Why not just integrate into already existing systems?\nFor example:\nA local supermarket allows you to shop with a barcode scanner.

This could happen without bitcoin... the real challenge is in writing a script to handle things like bagging (a store COULD have users bag themselves like \"no frills\" grocery stores, though), figuring out how to shelve and move all these items, and determining when the store needs to sell on clearance or dispose of inventory (including factors like humidity and temperature)... but if the community's underserved or unserved, it's not like you need to spend any thought on things like marketing. In my town and in a good few other rural areas, Dollar General's stepped in to provide a very limited number of extremely over-priced groceries, but it's really a piss-poor solution as far as the community members are concerned.\nI am sure that it would be possible for coinbase (or an exchange) to sign a message for you on your behalf, although any message they sign would also likely include the TXID in question - this may or may not be an issue for merchants verifying a signature.\nI wouldn't be surprised if we see apps in the future that would allow a smartphone to sign a message, it just isn't available now.\nI also don't think that most merchants would really be taking on that much risk to accepting a 0/unconfirmed TX as it is fairly easy to detect a double spend attack, especially not so much risk that they would want to incur the extra expense of having to pay someone to gather the items purchased for you\n", "author": "Window2Wall Full Member Offline Activity: 192 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-10-20 03:14:23", "content": "I'd have a different idea for underserved or completely unserved rural and rural-suburban areas.
