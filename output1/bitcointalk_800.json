The case grew from the governments shutdown of Silk Road. Shrem was chief executive officer of BitInstant, while Faiella operated an unlicensed money transferring business.\nShrem processed transactions for Faiella through BitInstant despite knowing the bitcoin would eventually find their way to Silk Road, where the funds would be used for drugs, he said in court.\nI knew that much of the business on Silk Road involved the buying and selling of narcotics, Shrem said in court. I knew that what I was doing was wrong.\nThey were accused of letting more than $1 million in Bitcoins reach the website Silk Road, where they said narcotics were bought and sold. Both men agreed to forfeit $950,000 to the government as part of their plea deals. Sentencing was set for Jan. 20, when each faces as much as five years in prison.\nAuthorities have said Silk Roads San Francisco operator generated more than $1 billion in illicit business since 2011 on the website. It used Bitcoin, a tough-to-track digital currency, before being shut down.\nU.S. authorities shut down Silk Road last year, though a new version bearing the same name was launched soon thereafter. The man accused of creating and operating Silk Road using the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, Ross William Ulbricht, is facing separate charges and is scheduled for trial in November.\nFull Story:\nhttp://altcoinpress.com/2014/09/charlie-shrem-pleads-guilty-in-federal-court/\n", "views": 1258, "author": "MicroGuy Legendary Online Activity: 1904 Merit: 1003 www.MicroGuy.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharlie Shrem - \"I Knew What I Was Doing Was Wrong\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-09-04 22:42:09", "content": "Thankfully his arrest combined with the shut down of Silk Road put an end of people using immoral vegetation!\nOh wait...\nhttp://www.extremetech.com/extreme/182083-the-silk-road-2-0-is-now-bigger-and-better-than-ever-before-whats-the-fbi-to-do\nSo much resources wasted on this lame war on drugs....\n", "author": "knight22 Legendary Offline Activity: 1372 Merit: 1000 ---------------&gt;¿?

After all, most of his work has involved pointing out all of the things Bitcoin enthusiasts dont want to hear.\nThe problem is that none of the points he makes are sound.\nIn looking at the way Bitcoin is used (or not) as a medium of exchange, he points out the number of daily transactions of Bitcoins has fundamentally not changed in the past year.\nWhatever. Has the number of transactions in dollars gone up in the last year? I bet there are years when the number of dollar transactions has gone down. Does this mean that the dollar fails as a unit of exchange?\nAs a means of payment, the fact that you have to calculate prices of purchases with amounts such as 0.00301 Bitcoin or 3.01 Bitcoin times 10 to the minus 2 effectively means it is never likely to become a unit of account.\nThe dollar used to be worth 20 times what it is now. People didn't have problems back then with it being a unit of account.\nProfessor Yermacks research on Bitcoin volatility found it displayed an average 10% price change per day with an overall volatility of 142% over the course of a year.\nYes, it is very volatile and that causes problems. As adoption grows, it will become less volatile. Does he have no ability to look ahead?\nAs a final taunt to the Bitcoin faithful, Professor Yermack suggests the entire Bitcoin mining effort could be subverted by a person or government ... In all likelihood this would be possible, but more research is required to convince the Bitcoin community of the validity of the argument.\nIt is called a 51% attack, and everyone is aware of it.\n", "author": "odolvlobo Legendary Offline Activity: 2240 Merit: 1135 "}, {"date": "2014-09-03 00:29:32", "content": "i don't find anything he said in that article to be too outrageous.. he seems fairly reasonable. only problem is his \"in 6 months\" prediction, which drew the ire of many bitcoin evangelists.\n", "author": "beetcoin Sr. Member Offline Activity: 434 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-09-03 02:00:49", "content": "i don't find anything he said in that article to be too outrageous.. he seems fairly reasonable. only problem is his \"in 6 months\" prediction, which drew the ire of many bitcoin evangelists.\nI would consider that to be outrageous.

Some companies are trying to build such insurance products, and governments must decide whether to provide security for a currency that, in some ways, competes with their own.\nYermack expects to pack the 50-seat room currently reserved for his class, but he knows the currencys popularity might be fleeting and, if its value crashes to just $5 or $10 between now and August, interest in the course could evaporate.\nThe trajectory of bitcoin is going to be crucial to whether the class actually happens, he says.\nStarting to assess bitcoin from an academic angle while the currency is still in its infancy allows Yermack and Miller to set the agenda for future study of the subject. You can help shape the field by stipulating what you think the important topics are, Yermack says. For an academic, thats fun.\nWith Bitcoin, all you really have is hope:\nI would not invest in Bitcoin if you're looking for a rate of return. I don't think you could consider it a good investment, especially for a poor household in a developing country that may not have much savings. Bitcoin is incredibly risky and there is no intrinsic value behind it. If you invest in a stock, there is a company paying dividends that supports the value of a stock. If you invest in a government bond, you have the government's promise to pay interest; with Bitcoin, all you really have is hope.\nCyber currency success requires government support:\nDavid Yermack, finance and business transformation professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business, notes that critical to the survival of a cyber-currency is government support. I am skeptical that any form of money will be successful if it is not backed by a sovereign government. Without this sort of foundation, a currency really cannot be a form of property because it cannot be pledged as collateral, foreclosed upon, reassigned in bankruptcy and so forth, he says. This will make it unattractive in a wide range of commercial settings.\nGovernments can try to ban [Bitcoin], but unless they literally control every communication over the Internet, it seems impossible to prevent transactions. Ali Shourideh\nIn a recent working paper, Yermack wrote that Bitcoin does not behave like a currency according to criteria used by economists. Money should be a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value. Bitcoin meets the first criterion because more merchants are accepting it as payment. But as a unit of account, it performs poorly because it requires businesses to quote prices to the fourth or fifth decimal place led by zeroes, which is impractical. Bitcoins also are quite volatile, with different exchanges quoting different prices without giving investors the ability to arbitrage. Finally, Bitcoin is a poor way to store value because it faces rampant hacking attacks and thefts, he points out. It also has virtually zero correlation to major currencies, so its value is completely untethered to them, making its risks nearly impossible to hedge for businesses and customers and [rendering] it more or less useless as a tool for risk management, according to Yermack.\nOn the silk road auction:\nEither this was a very clever piece of disinformation or a very careless error by the government. Its a little hard to know which from a distance, David L. Yermack, a professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business, said of the leak. You want to create the illusion that theres immense demand for this if youre the government because you want people to bid as much as theyre willing to.\nExperts are divided on what information about Mr. Drapers bid, if any, can be gleaned from the price increase. Losing bidders may be driving up the price because they know there is significant demand for the coins at a higher price. The increase could also be the result of interest in the auction itself, said David L. Yermack, a professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business.\nJust the fact that there was such broad demand would tend to push up the value of Bitcoin, he said.\nIs bitcoin a real currency?

Three out of ten hashed passwords (!) with an amount of altogether way more than 10 BTC could be converted back to plaintext. If I had more than five BTC in my account, I wouldn't use \"johnjohn\" as my password. So guys, hold on strong passwords, e.g. use calculated passwords which are different for each website (e.g. calculate them with a set of letters, numbers etc and the URL of the site or something like that, so they are not the same, but you can calculate them). Not to talk about 2FA.\nAnd, to make sure that your passwords are safe, do a rainbow tables check on it. Important: download the tables and do it on your pc,\nnever\nput your password into an online rainbow tables website, as there are many sites which just wait for you to enter your password, so they can md5 it and get the correct hash for the password (so there isn't even any need to calculate the hash back into the password, because you already gave it to them).\nOne more statement: I'd never steal BTC/money/anything from anybody.\n.edit:\nNeither the amounts nor the password \"johnjohn\" is what I have found.

Has the number of transactions in dollars gone up in the last year? I bet there are years when the number of dollar transactions has gone down. Does this mean that the dollar fails as a unit of exchange?\nAs a means of payment, the fact that you have to calculate prices of purchases with amounts such as 0.00301 Bitcoin or 3.01 Bitcoin times 10 to the minus 2 effectively means it is never likely to become a unit of account.\nThe dollar used to be worth 20 times what it is now. People didn't have problems back then with it being a unit of account.\nProfessor Yermacks research on Bitcoin volatility found it displayed an average 10% price change per day with an overall volatility of 142% over the course of a year.\nYes, it is very volatile and that causes problems. As adoption grows, it will become less volatile. Does he have no ability to look ahead?\nAs a final taunt to the Bitcoin faithful, Professor Yermack suggests the entire Bitcoin mining effort could be subverted by a person or government ... In all likelihood this would be possible, but more research is required to convince the Bitcoin community of the validity of the argument.\nIt is called a 51% attack, and everyone is aware of it.\n", "author": "odolvlobo Legendary Offline Activity: 2240 Merit: 1135 "}, {"date": "2014-09-03 00:29:32", "content": "i don't find anything he said in that article to be too outrageous.. he seems fairly reasonable. only problem is his \"in 6 months\" prediction, which drew the ire of many bitcoin evangelists.\n", "author": "beetcoin Sr. Member Offline Activity: 434 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-09-03 02:00:49", "content": "i don't find anything he said in that article to be too outrageous.. he seems fairly reasonable. only problem is his \"in 6 months\" prediction, which drew the ire of many bitcoin evangelists.\nI would consider that to be outrageous.

Some companies are trying to build such insurance products, and governments must decide whether to provide security for a currency that, in some ways, competes with their own.\nYermack expects to pack the 50-seat room currently reserved for his class, but he knows the currencys popularity might be fleeting and, if its value crashes to just $5 or $10 between now and August, interest in the course could evaporate.\nThe trajectory of bitcoin is going to be crucial to whether the class actually happens, he says.\nStarting to assess bitcoin from an academic angle while the currency is still in its infancy allows Yermack and Miller to set the agenda for future study of the subject. You can help shape the field by stipulating what you think the important topics are, Yermack says. For an academic, thats fun.\nWith Bitcoin, all you really have is hope:\nI would not invest in Bitcoin if you're looking for a rate of return. I don't think you could consider it a good investment, especially for a poor household in a developing country that may not have much savings. Bitcoin is incredibly risky and there is no intrinsic value behind it. If you invest in a stock, there is a company paying dividends that supports the value of a stock. If you invest in a government bond, you have the government's promise to pay interest; with Bitcoin, all you really have is hope.\nCyber currency success requires government support:\nDavid Yermack, finance and business transformation professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business, notes that critical to the survival of a cyber-currency is government support. I am skeptical that any form of money will be successful if it is not backed by a sovereign government. Without this sort of foundation, a currency really cannot be a form of property because it cannot be pledged as collateral, foreclosed upon, reassigned in bankruptcy and so forth, he says. This will make it unattractive in a wide range of commercial settings.\nGovernments can try to ban [Bitcoin], but unless they literally control every communication over the Internet, it seems impossible to prevent transactions. Ali Shourideh\nIn a recent working paper, Yermack wrote that Bitcoin does not behave like a currency according to criteria used by economists. Money should be a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value. Bitcoin meets the first criterion because more merchants are accepting it as payment. But as a unit of account, it performs poorly because it requires businesses to quote prices to the fourth or fifth decimal place led by zeroes, which is impractical. Bitcoins also are quite volatile, with different exchanges quoting different prices without giving investors the ability to arbitrage. Finally, Bitcoin is a poor way to store value because it faces rampant hacking attacks and thefts, he points out. It also has virtually zero correlation to major currencies, so its value is completely untethered to them, making its risks nearly impossible to hedge for businesses and customers and [rendering] it more or less useless as a tool for risk management, according to Yermack.\nOn the silk road auction:\nEither this was a very clever piece of disinformation or a very careless error by the government. Its a little hard to know which from a distance, David L. Yermack, a professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business, said of the leak. You want to create the illusion that theres immense demand for this if youre the government because you want people to bid as much as theyre willing to.\nExperts are divided on what information about Mr. Drapers bid, if any, can be gleaned from the price increase. Losing bidders may be driving up the price because they know there is significant demand for the coins at a higher price. The increase could also be the result of interest in the auction itself, said David L. Yermack, a professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business.\nJust the fact that there was such broad demand would tend to push up the value of Bitcoin, he said.\nIs bitcoin a real currency?
