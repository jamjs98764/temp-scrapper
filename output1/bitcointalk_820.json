Therefore even the most determined buyer could not buy all the bitcoins in existence.

Look at all of the people in Zimbabwe who were millionaires. Now everyone in Zimbabwe is a millionaire. If the dollar crashes, it is not because bitcoin takes over...but because it failed as a currency. With the fortunate timing that bitcoin is there as a lifeboat, otherwise we would be like Germany and people would start trading in bottles of whiskey and cigarettes. You wouldn't blame the crash on booze and cigarettes.\nAs bitcoin catches on, it will eventually replace certain percentages of the economy. Right now it is about .0001% of the economy. As people start using it it may move up to 1% of the economy. Reasonably that would mean that people might have 1% of their wealth in bitcoins. Once bitcoin reaches 10% of the economy people might have a few millibitcoins that they spend when it makes the most sense (paying for things online, sending money overseas, etc).\nAs it reaches 50% of the economy, people getting new jobs will start asking to be paid in bitcoins as they see the benefits to the dollar. So it will be like living on the border of Mexico, you keep dollars and pesos and pay with whichever currency is used. As it approaches that 100% mark, most people will not be using the dollar anymore. The rich will still be rich because the reason they are rich is because they are good with their money and will notice the inflationary nature of the dollar and look for a sound alternative.\nSure, if bitcoin replaces the dollar tomorrow, then you might have a point. But how would bitcoin replace the dollar tomorrow? It has to achieve gradual acceptance with more and more businesses accepting it and more people getting paid in bitcoin before that will ever happen.\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2014-07-18 19:58:05", "content": "So I have heard a lot of people say that Bitcoin will be the new currency.\nMy question is this:  So for all the other currencies out there, if you don't have any bitcoin, you would essentially be poor if Bitcoin did become the only usable currency correct?\nEx:  Hollywood millionaire Salma Hayek does not invest in bitcoin.  In the year 2016 Bitcoin's value is worth $100,000 dollars per 1 bit coin.  She can basically afford say 30 bit coins....just guessing.  Now, some average person who got into the game early, he invested and has 500 BTC.  I mean will stuff still cost a normal amount, how would it work, what sort of problems could it cause with economies?  Any thoughts on this anyone?\nWhy would you consider a person with $3 million as poor?\n", "author": "odolvlobo Legendary Offline Activity: 2240 Merit: 1135 "}, {"date": "2014-07-18 20:03:04", "content": "Why would you consider a person with $3 million as poor?\nI never said anything like that at all?  I said if she was forced into buying Bitcoins because that is the new currency...30 Bitcoins would hardly be considered rich.\n", "author": "leex1528 Hero Member Offline Activity: 784 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-07-18 20:05:31", "content": "Why would you consider a person with $3 million as poor?\nI never said anything like that at all?  I said if she was forced into buying Bitcoins because that is the new currency...30 Bitcoins would hardly be considered rich.\nA person with 30 bitcoins would be worth $3 million.

Here's what Wilson told his audience:\nWe said, If you come tonight, you're either a student, in which case we have sponsors who were making donations to cover the students, or you're buying a $25 ticket...But you had to pay it in Bitcoin. And I got a lot of emails from people, particularly in the last few days, who said, I don't have any Bitcoin, I would have to buy the Bitcoin, it's going to take me three days for the Bitcoin to show up in my account. So I'm not going to be able to get the Bitcoin in time to make it to the event. If you had Bitcoin in your account it was simple, you just gave 1/20th of a Bitcoin and you come. So, not enough people have it. And forcing people to buy the Bitcoin to give the money to the charity isn't a great model, and we actually saw that in this event.\nThe other obstacle Wilson identified to mainstream adoption is that the security systems surrounding Bitcoin remain - though he also says this is in itself represents a huge investment opportunity, as it will help address the first issue:\nOne of the real issues with Bitcoin right now is that it's not that secure, and the reason it's not that secure is, it's easy to hack into people's computers, if they have a wallet on their own computer, it's easy to get in there and steal the Bitcoin. Bitcoin theft is a big issue. Bitcoin fraud is a big issue. And what will have to happen is we will need to see companies like Coinbase and others merge that can invest heavily in security. And that's both technological security, and also process security - to make you comfortable to keep your Bitcoin there. And I think that that's probably going to be first big commercial opportunity in Bitcoin, is to create secure systems. Because without that, I don't think we'll ever get enough confidence and trust in the system for people to really start using it.\nSource\n", "views": 642, "author": "Stery Member Offline Activity: 118 Merit: 100 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne Of Bitcoin's Strongest Backers Reveals The Two Big Reasons\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2014-07-21 10:57:54"}, {"content": "whats stopping you from investing in Bitcoin?\n", "views": 1440, "author": "cryptopaths Hero Member Offline Activity: 616 Merit: 500 Crypto Knight ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhats stopping you from investing in Bitcoin?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-07-20 21:03:31", "content": "For me personally...nothing, I am invested in bitcoin.\nFor a lot of people - it is still very speculative and new and a lot of people do not understand it.\n", "author": "thriftshopping Full Member Offline Activity: 137 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-07-20 21:18:08", "content": "I would imagine that a lot of people are short on not only expendable cash but anything to which they can invest with.

The Trezor wallet is just starting to ship pre-orders and Butterfly Labs has still not shipped their hardware wallet (or anything at all for that matter). This has left a huge gap in the market for a stand-alone solution to offline storage that is not a paper wallet or a complicated DIY method.\nHardbit has stepped into that gap with the HB01.\nMy first impression of the HB01 is that it is rugged and small. It also looks like a mini cell phone with a touch screen and camera on the back.\nSize:\n2.5″ Touch Screen\n48 x 88 x 12.8mm\nIt comes with an extra 900 mah lithium battery. There is also a USB power cord and dongle to plug it in.\nIt does not come with a paper manual. There is a manual on the unit itself. The PDF is available in english on the Hardbit site. It is helpful but upon turning on the HB01 it walks you through setup very simply. It requires an Android app which I found easy to use during setup. As it is not transacting Bitcoin it also helps keep your Bitcoin safe.  There is not an app for iPhone as we all know Apple is anti-anything-they-do-not-control.\nThe interface is clean and easy to use. The screen is easy to see and glare not an issue when scanning the QR code.  In the directions, they stress making a secure password and also to make a backup.  One of the ways that the HB01 works is to allow for a backup. This way if your HB01 is lost or broken you still have your Bitcoin. The ability gives a bit more of a sense of security when using the HB01.\nhttp://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/hardbit-bitcoin-wallet-offline-secure-cold-storage/2014/05/20\n", "views": 2566, "author": "ManeBjorn Legendary Offline Activity: 1246 Merit: 1003 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHardbit Bitcoin Wallet Review\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-05-20 11:26:11", "content": "Nice!\nHow much does it cost?\nTheir website is not loading for me.\n", "author": "BitAddict Legendary Offline Activity: 1190 Merit: 1000 DoctorBitcoin "}, {"date": "2014-05-20 11:50:45", "content": "Ok so I received two of my hardbits today.  I would like to direct people to the users manual which is located here:\nhttp://www.hardbit.cn/index.php/downloads\nThe problem I have is this:\n1.

not get anywhere with trying to find out what it was.\nI agree with the other person who posted that the company needs to at least give some more info on it's internals and OS.  It seems that the OS is single purpose driven to the point it does this one thing only.  I could find no other options or things in it so far.\nAs for my review being PR positive it was because I am happy with it so far

No way to upload your own private key.  You must use the private key that comes with your wallet.  This means we need to rely on a third party hardbit.cn to assure us that the private key they generated was either destroyed or is kept somewhere securely.\n2. No way to download the private key on the wallet without using their proprietary backup system.\n3. No way to via a usb connection transmit data to / from the device.\nSeems like the the private keys are generated automatically by the wallet when setup. They still needs to open up the software and how it works for trust to be established.\nI will say this that they were quick to process my refund.  They refunded my shipping and handling.  When I pointed out that I wasn't happy that their source code was not open source and there were trust issues they stated that maybe sometime in the future they would like to use open source source code.\nThis company is genuinely trying to offer value in the bitcoin space I just am not interested in this particular approach.  But their honesty is a positive.  They would do much better if they decided to create online videos showcasing their product and how to use it.  If I could have seen one I would have saved them the trouble of the return process.\nJoshua\n", "author": "joshuad31 Newbie Offline Activity: 23 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2014-06-06 03:15:53", "content": "Good to know that they're easy to deal with.

As described by Bitcoin Foundation Regulation Affairs Committee Marco Santorini, the proposals target all members of the Bitcoin community:\nWho Requires a License: Surprise!  Everyone does.  Direct purchasers and sellers, multi-sig wallet providers, merchant payment processors, custodial exchanges, hell, even local wallet software providers probably need one [] Anyone who receives or transmits crypto as a business needs one\nSuch technology-specific legislations are misguided, unnecessary and unreasonable. It is a much more rational approach to start understanding how the current laws already apply. Bitcoin does not exist in a legal vacuum. The sole fact that Bitcoin is used as an alternative to fiat money in a given context does not make it exempt to the laws in place and in most cases only a clarification of existing rules so that they apply to Bitcoin is necessary.\nEnforcement of the Lawsky regulations, however, will prove to be an issue. The nature of Bitcoin is that the network is not, and cannot be, subjected to the control of any government, financial institution or any group whatsoever. Both the community and the technology are decentralized and will react organically to any external disruption, precisely because the network provides freedom of transaction.\nAs stated by Eric Vorhees: a technology like Bitcoin will lead humanity in its own direction, despite the most eloquent proclamations from kings of any country\nBecause of the extent of the burden created by this proposal, the incentive not to conduct business or to transact with individuals and corporations in the State of New York will become far greater. Financial and technological innovation will simply happen elsewhere. Bitcoin businesses have proven to be very mobile and sensitive to their regulatory environment.\nHowever, Canadian authorities have proven to be cooperative and no such drastic proposals are being considered here. I am confident that they will approach Bitcoin in a rational and pragmatic manner that will truly foster innovation. Canada could very well prove to be a haven for the Bitcoin industry, much to its benefit.\n", "views": 753, "author": "BitFrank Jr. Member Offline Activity: 33 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProposed BitLicense regulations will isolate New York\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-07-20 19:25:01", "content": "Aye, the regulations as they stand now will be very onerous to certain types of Bitcoin functions and businesses.

Look at all of the people in Zimbabwe who were millionaires. Now everyone in Zimbabwe is a millionaire. If the dollar crashes, it is not because bitcoin takes over...but because it failed as a currency. With the fortunate timing that bitcoin is there as a lifeboat, otherwise we would be like Germany and people would start trading in bottles of whiskey and cigarettes. You wouldn't blame the crash on booze and cigarettes.\nAs bitcoin catches on, it will eventually replace certain percentages of the economy. Right now it is about .0001% of the economy. As people start using it it may move up to 1% of the economy. Reasonably that would mean that people might have 1% of their wealth in bitcoins. Once bitcoin reaches 10% of the economy people might have a few millibitcoins that they spend when it makes the most sense (paying for things online, sending money overseas, etc).\nAs it reaches 50% of the economy, people getting new jobs will start asking to be paid in bitcoins as they see the benefits to the dollar. So it will be like living on the border of Mexico, you keep dollars and pesos and pay with whichever currency is used. As it approaches that 100% mark, most people will not be using the dollar anymore. The rich will still be rich because the reason they are rich is because they are good with their money and will notice the inflationary nature of the dollar and look for a sound alternative.\nSure, if bitcoin replaces the dollar tomorrow, then you might have a point. But how would bitcoin replace the dollar tomorrow? It has to achieve gradual acceptance with more and more businesses accepting it and more people getting paid in bitcoin before that will ever happen.\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2014-07-18 19:58:05", "content": "So I have heard a lot of people say that Bitcoin will be the new currency.\nMy question is this:  So for all the other currencies out there, if you don't have any bitcoin, you would essentially be poor if Bitcoin did become the only usable currency correct?\nEx:  Hollywood millionaire Salma Hayek does not invest in bitcoin.  In the year 2016 Bitcoin's value is worth $100,000 dollars per 1 bit coin.  She can basically afford say 30 bit coins....just guessing.  Now, some average person who got into the game early, he invested and has 500 BTC.  I mean will stuff still cost a normal amount, how would it work, what sort of problems could it cause with economies?  Any thoughts on this anyone?\nWhy would you consider a person with $3 million as poor?\n", "author": "odolvlobo Legendary Offline Activity: 2240 Merit: 1135 "}, {"date": "2014-07-18 20:03:04", "content": "Why would you consider a person with $3 million as poor?\nI never said anything like that at all?  I said if she was forced into buying Bitcoins because that is the new currency...30 Bitcoins would hardly be considered rich.\n", "author": "leex1528 Hero Member Offline Activity: 784 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-07-18 20:05:31", "content": "Why would you consider a person with $3 million as poor?\nI never said anything like that at all?  I said if she was forced into buying Bitcoins because that is the new currency...30 Bitcoins would hardly be considered rich.\nA person with 30 bitcoins would be worth $3 million.

Money is a quick and simple way to refer to someone's wealth, but probably not the best. This is because money, what it can purchase, changes. This may not be apparent day to day, but when zoomed out, say over decades, and certainly over centuries it does.\nA better measure of someone's wealth is the assets they have. This can be in the form of real estate, stocks and bonds etc., but also includes things like art. Less tangible items include a person's health and access to first world economies, doctors, and technology. In other words, being wealthy is really about having the wherewithal to keep a sustained quality of life, and having the popular currency of the day is usually the most expedient means to that end.\n", "author": "acoindr Legendary Offline Activity: 1050 Merit: 1001 "}, {"date": "2014-07-18 22:43:14", "content": "It is a misconception that wealthy people would lose everything if the dollar became worthless.

Here's what Wilson told his audience:\nWe said, If you come tonight, you're either a student, in which case we have sponsors who were making donations to cover the students, or you're buying a $25 ticket...But you had to pay it in Bitcoin. And I got a lot of emails from people, particularly in the last few days, who said, I don't have any Bitcoin, I would have to buy the Bitcoin, it's going to take me three days for the Bitcoin to show up in my account. So I'm not going to be able to get the Bitcoin in time to make it to the event. If you had Bitcoin in your account it was simple, you just gave 1/20th of a Bitcoin and you come. So, not enough people have it. And forcing people to buy the Bitcoin to give the money to the charity isn't a great model, and we actually saw that in this event.\nThe other obstacle Wilson identified to mainstream adoption is that the security systems surrounding Bitcoin remain - though he also says this is in itself represents a huge investment opportunity, as it will help address the first issue:\nOne of the real issues with Bitcoin right now is that it's not that secure, and the reason it's not that secure is, it's easy to hack into people's computers, if they have a wallet on their own computer, it's easy to get in there and steal the Bitcoin. Bitcoin theft is a big issue. Bitcoin fraud is a big issue. And what will have to happen is we will need to see companies like Coinbase and others merge that can invest heavily in security. And that's both technological security, and also process security - to make you comfortable to keep your Bitcoin there. And I think that that's probably going to be first big commercial opportunity in Bitcoin, is to create secure systems. Because without that, I don't think we'll ever get enough confidence and trust in the system for people to really start using it.\nSource\n", "views": 642, "author": "Stery Member Offline Activity: 118 Merit: 100 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOne Of Bitcoin's Strongest Backers Reveals The Two Big Reasons\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2014-07-21 10:57:54"}, {"content": "whats stopping you from investing in Bitcoin?\n", "views": 1440, "author": "cryptopaths Hero Member Offline Activity: 616 Merit: 500 Crypto Knight ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhats stopping you from investing in Bitcoin?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-07-20 21:03:31", "content": "For me personally...nothing, I am invested in bitcoin.\nFor a lot of people - it is still very speculative and new and a lot of people do not understand it.\n", "author": "thriftshopping Full Member Offline Activity: 137 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-07-20 21:18:08", "content": "I would imagine that a lot of people are short on not only expendable cash but anything to which they can invest with.

The Trezor wallet is just starting to ship pre-orders and Butterfly Labs has still not shipped their hardware wallet (or anything at all for that matter). This has left a huge gap in the market for a stand-alone solution to offline storage that is not a paper wallet or a complicated DIY method.\nHardbit has stepped into that gap with the HB01.\nMy first impression of the HB01 is that it is rugged and small. It also looks like a mini cell phone with a touch screen and camera on the back.\nSize:\n2.5″ Touch Screen\n48 x 88 x 12.8mm\nIt comes with an extra 900 mah lithium battery. There is also a USB power cord and dongle to plug it in.\nIt does not come with a paper manual. There is a manual on the unit itself. The PDF is available in english on the Hardbit site. It is helpful but upon turning on the HB01 it walks you through setup very simply. It requires an Android app which I found easy to use during setup. As it is not transacting Bitcoin it also helps keep your Bitcoin safe.  There is not an app for iPhone as we all know Apple is anti-anything-they-do-not-control.\nThe interface is clean and easy to use. The screen is easy to see and glare not an issue when scanning the QR code.  In the directions, they stress making a secure password and also to make a backup.  One of the ways that the HB01 works is to allow for a backup. This way if your HB01 is lost or broken you still have your Bitcoin. The ability gives a bit more of a sense of security when using the HB01.\nhttp://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/hardbit-bitcoin-wallet-offline-secure-cold-storage/2014/05/20\n", "views": 2566, "author": "ManeBjorn Legendary Offline Activity: 1246 Merit: 1003 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHardbit Bitcoin Wallet Review\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-05-20 11:26:11", "content": "Nice!\nHow much does it cost?\nTheir website is not loading for me.\n", "author": "BitAddict Legendary Offline Activity: 1190 Merit: 1000 DoctorBitcoin "}, {"date": "2014-05-20 11:50:45", "content": "Ok so I received two of my hardbits today.  I would like to direct people to the users manual which is located here:\nhttp://www.hardbit.cn/index.php/downloads\nThe problem I have is this:\n1.

it.  This does not mean that it cannot be done but I was not able to.  It did not show up as a storage device either.\n3- It works without ever having to be connected to anything via any means other than power to charge the battery every now and then.  All the sync'ing was done with QR codes.  At no point does it need to be connected to anything.  In fact you don't even have to create a wallet backup if you do not want to.  I did because I am paranoid and wanted a backup.\nI could not tell you about the chips as I did not tear it completely apart.  The software is so mission specific I did not get anywhere with trying to find out what it was.\nI agree with the other person who posted that the company needs to at least give some more info on it's internals and OS.  It seems that the OS is single purpose driven to the point it does this one thing only.  I could find no other options or things in it so far.\nAs for my review being PR positive it was because I am happy with it so far and did not find any real negatives to turn me off to it yet.  That may change if something comes up and I will update you all immediately if it does.\nThis was not an item from the company to me to review either.\nI purchased this because I wanted to try a solution now and not much else was shipping that I could get my hands on.  The Trezor is out but they are only fulfilling pre-orders so far.  BFL rarely ships anything.  The Pitbull did not get funding enough to produce any yet.  That left me with the Hardbit to try.\nAs soon as I can get a Trezor I am going to do a comparison.  I hope to know more about the Hardbit by then as well as I have sent an email asking about some of the very things you asked about.\nAlso thanks for your input I will remember these things so I can make my

The sole fact that Bitcoin is used as an alternative to fiat money in a given context does not make it exempt to the laws in place and in most cases only a clarification of existing rules so that they apply to Bitcoin is necessary.\nEnforcement of the Lawsky regulations, however, will prove to be an issue. The nature of Bitcoin is that the network is not, and cannot be, subjected to the control of any government, financial institution or any group whatsoever. Both the community and the technology are decentralized and will react organically to any external disruption, precisely because the network provides freedom of transaction.\nAs stated by Eric Vorhees: a technology like Bitcoin will lead humanity in its own direction, despite the most eloquent proclamations from kings of any country\nBecause of the extent of the burden created by this proposal, the incentive not to conduct business or to transact with individuals and corporations in the State of New York will become far greater. Financial and technological innovation will simply happen elsewhere. Bitcoin businesses have proven to be very mobile and sensitive to their regulatory environment.\nHowever, Canadian authorities have proven to be cooperative and no such drastic proposals are being considered here. I am confident that they will approach Bitcoin in a rational and pragmatic manner that will truly foster innovation. Canada could very well prove to be a haven for the Bitcoin industry, much to its benefit.\n", "views": 753, "author": "BitFrank Jr. Member Offline Activity: 33 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProposed BitLicense regulations will isolate New York\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-07-20 19:25:01", "content": "Aye, the regulations as they stand now will be very onerous to certain types of Bitcoin functions and businesses.
