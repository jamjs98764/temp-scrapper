I will try to give a very simple explanation of the voting portion of it.\nBitPools is made up of groups of people pledging money toward a common cause.\nWhen enough money is pledged, people with solutions come forward with proposals for the group.\nWhen a proposal is submitted, an amount is set for the proposal to be passed and a minimum amount of bitcoins required per vote. At this time, a list of Bitcoin addresses is created with one address per user (or multiple if there are more options).\nAt this point, the list of Bitcoin addresses is encrypted and made available to everyone.\nBetween that time and the vote date people can vote by sending bitcoins to their assigned address.\nOnce the vote date passes, the decryption files are provided as well as the decrypted list of Bitcoin addresses.\nFrom there, you can see the results of the vote by looking at each address and looking on the blockchain to see if the address has the minimum vote amount.\nFrom there, if the vote passes the proposer gets the funds to put toward the solution (or is escrowed). Otherwise, the bitcoins are returned to the voters.\nGavin actually suggested this method to me, many thanks for such a simple solution.\nTL;DR A list of Bitcoin addresses is created and one address is given to each voter, the list is encrypted and made available (people vote by sending bitcoins to their address). After the vote the decryption key is made available and votes can be checked via the blockchain.\nWhat are your thoughts?

You generate one address per choice for each voter. So if you have 2 choices, you generate 200 addresses.\nYou could even do it on paper, print a QR code and address for choice A and one for choice B.\nPrint those out and have them available at the precinct polling station. Have them in sealed envelopes. Each voter comes in, they go into their booth and open the envelope, scan the QR code and send a bit to the address.\nThen they drop the paper into a sealed box for verification later.\nOr you could step it up and put it on a CD, USB, whichever...they plug it into the voting machine and make their choices.\nEven less secure but more user friendly would be to have each voting machine loaded up with addresses. You keep track of how many people use it and ensure (with people) that each person only gets to vote once. Most secure would be them sending bitcoins themselves, less secure would be the machine having a bitcoin client to send bitcoins to the address for the voter (behind the scenes).\nIf you were able to verify each user online it could facilitate online (at home) voting. There are many ways to do this but definitely not foolproof nor hackproof.\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2014-11-25 18:50:15", "content": "I believe that many people are confused about how BitPools actually works. I will try to give a very simple explanation of the voting portion of it.\nBitPools is made up of groups of people pledging money toward a common cause.\nWhen enough money is pledged, people with solutions come forward with proposals for the group.\nWhen a proposal is submitted, an amount is set for the proposal to be passed and a minimum amount of bitcoins required per vote. At this time, a list of Bitcoin addresses is created with one address per user (or multiple if there are more options).\nAt this point, the list of Bitcoin addresses is encrypted and made available to everyone.\nBetween that time and the vote date people can vote by sending bitcoins to their assigned address.\nOnce the vote date passes, the decryption files are provided as well as the decrypted list of Bitcoin addresses.\nFrom there, you can see the results of the vote by looking at each address and looking on the blockchain to see if the address has the minimum vote amount.\nFrom there, if the vote passes the proposer gets the funds to put toward the solution (or is escrowed). Otherwise, the bitcoins are returned to the voters.\nGavin actually suggested this method to me, many thanks for such a simple solution.\nTL;DR A list of Bitcoin addresses is created and one address is given to each voter, the list is encrypted and made available (people vote by sending bitcoins to their address). After the vote the decryption key is made available and votes can be checked via the blockchain.\nWhat are your thoughts? Any vulnerabilities, other solutions this could be applied toward, could this work toward regular voting?\ni think you have a very good idea. much better than the diebold scam or hanging chads.\n", "author": "aztecminer Legendary Offline Activity: 1092 Merit: 1000 "}], "date": "2014-11-23 18:17:04"}, {"content": "http://247news.net/news/1-player-bitcoin-casino/\nWSOP only 10M to winner\nThe 20M deep water\n1 Player Tournament\nwinner takes all now allows btc for the 2.2M ten player buy in aboard a 100 foot yacht.\nThe famous game has run for years in deep water and now that some of the players are running 1 Player and using btc they are allowing btc to be how their players buy into their famous game which was a cash buy in for years.\n", "views": 853, "author": "247casino Jr. Member Offline Activity: 56 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHighest Stake Poker Game in the World now uses BITCOIN\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-11-25 16:16:52", "content": "title a little misleading they accept bitcoin as a buy into the tournament i think, still cool though\n", "author": "BitCoinNutJob Legendary Offline Activity: 1162 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-11-25 16:24:13", "content": "Probably wise these days...\nhttp://reason.com/blog/2014/10/01/iowa-troopers-steal-100000-in-poker-winn\n", "author": "Flashman Hero Member Offline Activity: 518 Merit: 500 Hodl!

Additionally, large miners are likely to, eventually, vertically integrate other services. There are some potential negatives (as well as positives) to that, but it also probably means that there are a number of workable business models for a number of large fairly-efficient miners, as opposed to an endgame where strictly the least-cost producer gobbles all hashpower.\nRegardless of all that, the same arguments that are thrown around about mining could be thrown around about data-centers in general (OMG! there will only be a single least-cost/massive-scale producer that will run everything!), or pretty much *any* industry for that matter; this is really just a (mostly) extrapolated-short-sight criticism of capitalism in general, not specifically bitcoin mining. Few industries actually coalesce to pure monopoly in practice.\nAnyway, the natural incentives of bitcoin mining make it less likely than other domains.\nThanks for that mate! Yeah it's interesting how Moore's Law will apply to BTC Hashing.\nSort of like Ivy Bridge; Haswell; Broadwell; ....\nIt's interesting that the engineers/architects @ Intel haven't looked into.

The address the senders use is controlled by BitPools, they then forward those funds on to the winning proposal. Though those funds are only held during the duration of the vote.\nBut just like any centralized business structure, stealing funds makes no business sense. Once the vote passes and the funds are not transferred, BitPools would no longer be trusted for further votes.\nMore security would come via multi-sig transactions or something like Mike Hearn's distributed project lighthouse. But I have found that the concept is complicated enough at the moment and adding much more security at this point is not necessary until large amounts of funds are being transferred.\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2014-11-25 15:18:51", "content": "Overview in video form:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCP8NeXasY\nI'm very interested in this idea.

You generate one address per choice for each voter. So if you have 2 choices, you generate 200 addresses.\nYou could even do it on paper, print a QR code and address for choice A and one for choice B.\nPrint those out and have them available at the precinct polling station. Have them in sealed envelopes. Each voter comes in, they go into their booth and open the envelope, scan the QR code and send a bit to the address.\nThen they drop the paper into a sealed box for verification later.\nOr you could step it up and put it on a CD, USB, whichever...they plug it into the voting machine and make their choices.\nEven less secure but more user friendly would be to have each voting machine loaded up with addresses. You keep track of how many people use it and ensure (with people) that each person only gets to vote once. Most secure would be them sending bitcoins themselves, less secure would be the machine having a bitcoin client to send bitcoins to the address for the voter (behind the scenes).\nIf you were able to verify each user online it could facilitate online (at home) voting. There are many ways to do this but definitely not foolproof nor hackproof.\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2014-11-25 18:50:15", "content": "I believe that many people are confused about how BitPools actually works.
