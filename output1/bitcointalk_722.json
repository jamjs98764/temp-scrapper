I heard that some people repacked it with bitcoin stealing software so some people had problems.\nI think anybody who is naive enough to think that Mark doesn't have all the bitcoins they are nuts. He has them all. Except the ones he bribe the Trustee with. There was no hackers, nobody could lose hundreds of thousands of bitcoins for months and months in a row. Halting any cash payment for months and months, having a price $50-$100 bucks higher than other exchanges, then not even letting any bitcoin coins be transferred out for months, then coming out and pretending like there were all the sudden hackers that clean ed the place out in a week and no blockchain activity.\nThe trustee pays Tibane (mark) to settle some account for $200k of our money, then 6 months later we find out that Tibane owe huge amounts to Gox when it files BK. How does the Trustee justify paying off Tibane $200k, when it is a net debtor, yet it gets paid off way ahead of REAL creditors???\nHe Fucking doesn't. He just smiles and tells us to fuck off and that there isn't shit we can do about it. Meanwhile he just keeps peeling off our money as fast as he can, picking and choosing, seemingly at random, who gets paid, what and when. No plan, no strategy, no standard operating procedure, no checks, no balances, no recourse, nobody to complain.\nIf this would have all happened in the USA, the would first arrested Mark day one  until he proved he didn't steal the Coins and they would crack that fat ass and have him screaming for his mommy begging to give the coins back. Instead, we have the Barney Fife, who admittedly doesn't have a clue what a bitcoin even is, but he has his one bullet and he is in charge of the whole investigation, pretending he is doing something. The only thing they are doing is just waiting as long as they can, hoping as many people die or forget just how much of a cluster-fuck they are, beating the people down so they will be so grateful to get 10 cents on the dollar for their bitcoin.\nThey will probably make it so tough to even get your coins out that they will have tons of people that will just give up after jumping through every single hoop they tell you. Meanwhile, the few people left that can stomach to hang in there long enough will probably be told that we will get paid \"soonish\" and how sorry Mark and the Trustee are for their complete and utter incompetence at best or complete criminal fraudsters most likely.\nSorry for the rant, just can't stand people saying Mark doesn't have our coins and doesn't know where they are, then he has the unmitigated gall to actually say that there was 850,000 coins lost instead of 650,000, because he lost $200k of his own coins. And nobody says shit about that. Listen, if I own a company and I lose or steal my clients money, the last thing on the planet I am going to try to get anybody to believe is that they shouldn't feel so bad because I lost more than they did. Then when it comes time to share in the pennies on the dollar payoff, he will probably want his alleged 200k coins back first then leave us to split the rest.\nThat fat fuck should know one thing. If you lose $200k coins. You didn't lose any of our coins, you lost all your coins. You lose your money before you let your clients lose a penny. When it comes time to settle up, your clients get as much money as possible back and if there is anything left, then you get that....\n", "author": "traderash@aol.com Newbie Offline Activity: 9 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-02-24 15:12:34", "content": "I don't understand why again it has to be Mt Gox.

This got me thinking about Bitcoin in whole and how it is currently but many are afraid of it's volatility but also how it is very comparable to Gold. Countries aren't willing to use gold as their national currency as it would be too much of a pain for them to keep control over but they're willing to back their currency by it. So this led me to the thought of a currency backed by Bitcoin and how this wouldn't be such an extreme issue and essentially be no risk to the government who does it anyway.\nSo lets go into a hypothetical world, Greece leaves the Euro and makes it's own currency the drachma and they decide they need more than just a Fiat at this point since Greece has been in such turmoil and there may not be much faith in it. Greece certainly can't buy a ton of gold to back their drachma but they could back their Drachma with Bitcoin. They wouldn't need to build a fortess like Fort Knox to securely store gold they would have to invest a small amount into Bitcoin security. They could have government exchanges or deals with banks that will allow you to bring your paper notes and have the Bitcoin sent to your bank whenever you want without fee's, they could use long lasting polymer notes and put them back into recirculation when they replenish the Bitcoin or instantly with the exchange rate lowered.\nThe best part is that Greece has nothing to lose from this system as they would be backing their Drachma with nothing but the faith of Greece if not, even if Bitcoin somehow failed it can be changed to a standard fiat without any issue.\nAs for security the private keys could be split with parts held at the UN and Greece while embedded on steel plates and using a physical encryption (or BIP32) Security could be discussed later.\nSo how would that sound, a countries dollar backed by Bitcoin, do you think this would work in the real constantly changing world?\nThe government has nothing to lose and the nations citizen has an option to exchange their currency to a decentralized worldwide storage of value. Security would be easier and auditing would be a snap compared to gold and the transferring wouldn't take months.\n", "views": 1537, "author": "kingcolex Legendary Online Activity: 1596 Merit: 1007 Anonymous bitcoin mixer ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin backed National currency, the digital standard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-02-20 16:57:58", "content": "I also should note that the government should post links on wallets how to download them and train people how to redeem and protect their coins via a website.\n", "author": "kingcolex Legendary Online Activity: 1596 Merit: 1007 Anonymous bitcoin mixer "}, {"date": "2015-02-20 17:02:18", "content": "Interesting idea, but one problem is that the current market cap of bitcoin is far too low for an economy the size of Greece.

I heard that some people repacked it with bitcoin stealing software so some people had problems.\nI think anybody who is naive enough to think that Mark doesn't have all the bitcoins they are nuts. He has them all. Except the ones he bribe the Trustee with. There was no hackers, nobody could lose hundreds of thousands of bitcoins for months and months in a row. Halting any cash payment for months and months, having a price $50-$100 bucks higher than other exchanges, then not even letting any bitcoin coins be transferred out for months, then coming out and pretending like there were all the sudden hackers that clean ed the place out in a week and no blockchain activity.\nThe trustee pays Tibane (mark) to settle some account for $200k of our money, then 6 months later we find out that Tibane owe huge amounts to Gox when it files BK. How does the Trustee justify paying off Tibane $200k, when it is a net debtor, yet it gets paid off way ahead of REAL creditors???\nHe Fucking doesn't. He just smiles and tells us to fuck off and that there isn't shit we can do about it. Meanwhile he just keeps peeling off our money as fast as he can, picking and choosing, seemingly at random, who gets paid, what and when. No plan, no strategy, no standard operating procedure, no checks, no balances, no recourse, nobody to complain.\nIf this would have all happened in the USA, the would first arrested Mark day one  until he proved he didn't steal the Coins and they would crack that fat ass and have him screaming for his mommy begging to give the coins back. Instead, we have the Barney Fife, who admittedly doesn't have a clue what a bitcoin even is, but he has his one bullet and he is in charge of the whole investigation, pretending he is doing something. The only thing they are doing is just waiting as long as they can, hoping as many people die or forget just how much of a cluster-fuck they are, beating the people down so they will be so grateful to get 10 cents on the dollar for their bitcoin.\nThey will probably make it so tough to even get your coins out that they will have tons of people that will just give up after jumping through every single hoop they tell you. Meanwhile, the few people left that can stomach to hang in there long enough will probably be told that we will get paid \"soonish\" and how sorry Mark and the Trustee are for their complete and utter incompetence at best or complete criminal fraudsters most likely.\nSorry for the rant, just can't stand people saying Mark doesn't have our coins and doesn't know where they are, then he has the unmitigated gall to actually say that there was 850,000 coins lost instead of 650,000, because he lost $200k of his own coins. And nobody says shit about that. Listen, if I own a company and I lose or steal my clients money, the last thing on the planet I am going to try to get anybody to believe is that they shouldn't feel so bad because I lost more than they did. Then when it comes time to share in the pennies on the dollar payoff, he will probably want his alleged 200k coins back first then leave us to split the rest.\nThat fat fuck should know one thing. If you lose $200k coins. You didn't lose any of our coins, you lost all your coins. You lose your money before you let your clients lose a penny. When it comes time to settle up, your clients get as much money as possible back and if there is anything left, then you get that....\n", "author": "traderash@aol.com Newbie Offline Activity: 9 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-02-24 15:12:34", "content": "I don't understand why again it has to be Mt Gox.

This got me thinking about Bitcoin in whole and how it is currently but many are afraid of it's volatility but also how it is very comparable to Gold. Countries aren't willing to use gold as their national currency as it would be too much of a pain for them to keep control over but they're willing to back their currency by it. So this led me to the thought of a currency backed by Bitcoin and how this wouldn't be such an extreme issue and essentially be no risk to the government who does it anyway.\nSo lets go into a hypothetical world, Greece leaves the Euro and makes it's own currency the drachma and they decide they need more than just a Fiat at this point since Greece has been in such turmoil and there may not be much faith in it. Greece certainly can't buy a ton of gold to back their drachma but they could back their Drachma with Bitcoin. They wouldn't need to build a fortess like Fort Knox to securely store gold they would have to invest a small amount into Bitcoin security. They could have government exchanges or deals with banks that will allow you to bring your paper notes and have the Bitcoin sent to your bank whenever you want without fee's, they could use long lasting polymer notes and put them back into recirculation when they replenish the Bitcoin or instantly with the exchange rate lowered.\nThe best part is that Greece has nothing to lose from this system as they would be backing their Drachma with nothing but the faith of Greece if not, even if Bitcoin somehow failed it can be changed to a standard fiat without any issue.\nAs for security the private keys could be split with parts held at the UN and Greece while embedded on steel plates and using a physical encryption (or BIP32) Security could be discussed later.\nSo how would that sound, a countries dollar backed by Bitcoin, do you think this would work in the real constantly changing world?\nThe government has nothing to lose and the nations citizen has an option to exchange their currency to a decentralized worldwide storage of value. Security would be easier and auditing would be a snap compared to gold and the transferring wouldn't take months.\n", "views": 1537, "author": "kingcolex Legendary Online Activity: 1596 Merit: 1007 Anonymous bitcoin mixer ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin backed National currency, the digital standard\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-02-20 16:57:58", "content": "I also should note that the government should post links on wallets how to download them and train people how to redeem and protect their coins via a website.\n", "author": "kingcolex Legendary Online Activity: 1596 Merit: 1007 Anonymous bitcoin mixer "}, {"date": "2015-02-20 17:02:18", "content": "Interesting idea, but one problem is that the current market cap of bitcoin is far too low for an economy the size of Greece.

Mainly this is what I feel is lacking and what I envision for bitcoin to become a currency of its own.\nSo here's my thought.\nFor an Individual's perspective\nA person earns his wages in bitcoin (we are there)\nA person can spend his earning to fulfill all his daily needs which means he/she can buy anything, and I mean anything with bitcoin (Something we are lacking because not all goods and services accept bitcoin)\nIf we have goods priced only in bitcoin and accept no fiat for it (that would be the best, but I see this lacking)\nAt the end of the month, refills back his spending power from his monthly wages paid in bitcoin\nA portion of his earning, not spent is kept in the wallet and HOARDED...and yes, hoard all you want\nFor a business entity\nMake available products priced in bitcoin\nAccounting ledger and reported earnings all done in bitcoin\nPays workers' wages in bitcoin\nSo what I'm trying to say here is that as long those two infrastructure or components are there, we are basically on our own enclosed ecosystem\nWhat prevents bitcoin from taking off is basically:\n#1 : The spending part where we can't buy all the things we want using bitcoin\n#2 : Lack on the number of company/business entity which is bitcoin oriented\nBasically we are telling people to spend. But the actual fact or scenario is that we can spend but at the same time, we need to buy back to cover the amount spent or else it will just be a net drain of fund which leads to nothing for bitcoin. However, if we manage to establish the ecosystem here, we are basically on our own. Free from fiat and that is when\n1 bitcoin is equal to 1 bitcoin\n..\nBitcoin will always fluctuate in value against other currencies, stocks or commodities.\n", "author": "picolo Hero Member Offline Activity: 882 Merit: 500 https://www.localcoinswap.com/ "}, {"date": "2015-02-13 14:23:48", "content": "If you want Bitcoin to be a world currency then there should be an exchange rate.

Bitcoin is a currency without a country so there is no economy built around it. Currently, it's impossible to say what a loaf of bread is worth in bitcoins without exchanging it to a regional currency first.\nThe euro was created because a single currency offers many advantages and benefits over the previous situation where each Member State had its own currency. Not only are fluctuation risks and exchange costs eliminated and the single market strengthened, but the euro also means closer co-operation among Member States for a stable currency and economy to the benefit of us all.\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean that euro needs to be isolated from the rest of the world. Likewise, bitcoin can establish its own niche and exists within its own ecosystem and still traded on the exchange. We substitute country with community/internet/network here. The economy surrounding bitcoin is basically the mining operation. Yeah, we don't have tax, industry to turn raw material into goods, but if you compare the mining concept, its pretty much close to that.

The purchasing power of the dollar isn't measured first against other currencies, but against a \"basket of common goods\". That's how the US determines it's inflation rate each year.\nPurchasing power of bitcoin doesn't need to be in relation to fiat, in fact if it were it wouldn't indicate how much goods or services you could purchase with bitcoin, but rather how much of the fiat currency you could buy with bitcoin. And if both bitcoin and the fiat are declining purchasing power is disappearing but you wouldn't know it by the conversion rate.\n", "author": "Possum577 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 434 Merit: 250 Loose lips sink sigs!
