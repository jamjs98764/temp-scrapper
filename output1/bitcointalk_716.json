We can download Ubuntu14.04.1 32bits desktop ISO file\nand burn it on CD。\n2, One USB stick,USB3.0 is better.\n3, Ubuntu14.04.1 32bits desktop ISO file from official site.\n4, Electrum software from official site.\nFile list：\nFile list：\n1，file：ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\nmd5: a4fc15313ef2a516bfbf83ce44281535\nOfficial web page://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\n2，file：Electrum-1.9.8.zip\nmd5: 0f91f548ba64b1f5776a28b1522f07ec\nOfficial web page：\nhttps://www.electrum.org/download.html\nThe MD5 values of Ubuntu and Electrum can be found on official site.\nDownload above files,and record MD5 values on text file for verify.\nMD5 value verify ways：\nWindows user：Download WinMD5Free software to verify file。\nLinux user： run md5sum filename .\nCreation steps\nⅠ. USB stick partition\nWe will create two partitions on USB stick and install OS on the second partition.\nBecause, Windows doesnt recognize the second partition. This strategy has extra\nprotection where the USB inserted in online windows machine carelessly.\n1,Boot from Ubuntu CD，select Try Ubuntu button, and insert USB stick.\n2,Click \"Dash Home button\"（top-left button）-&gt;input \"disk\"-&gt;Click \"Disks\"，create partition on the USB stick。\nⅡ. Create persistent Live-USB stick\nClick \"Dash Home button\"（top-left button）-&gt;input \"creator\"-&gt;Click \"Startup Disk Creator\"，（please select \"Stored in extra space\" option）。\nAfter persistent Live-USB stick creation completion, Boot form the USB stick on a offline PC.\nSelect Try Ubuntu button on welcome screen.\n(For Thinkpad PC, press F12 to open the Boot menu during system post.\nThe shortcut key is various. it may be F12,F2,F10 or ESC.\nif it doesnt works we need look up the computer reference.)\nⅢ.System settings.\nThe following steps all run in the terminal window.\n1,Change the password of the default user ubuntu (default password is blank)\nrun\nCode:\npasswd\n2，Disable desktop automatic login\nCode:\nsudo vi /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\nEdit content with the following：\nCode:\n[SeatDefaults]\nallow-guest=false\nautologin-guest=false\nautologin-user=\nautologin-user-timeout=0\nautologin-session=lightdm-autologin\ngreeter-show-manual-login=true\n3，Disable other terminal automatic login.\nCode:\nsudo rm /etc/init/tty*.conf\n4，Cancel Ubuntu weclome screen when boot.\nCode:\nsudo vi /media/cdrom/syslinux/syslinux.cfg\nEdit content with the following：\nCode:\ndefault live\nlabel live\nmenu label ^Try Ubuntu without installing\nkernel /casper/vmlinuz\nappend noprompt cdrom-detect/try-usb=true persistent file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\nⅣ.

It's a product of a need and means to a way. I think that it has great resemblences to the invention of the bookpress and printing. The bookpress was invented because it was a necessity at that time to easely spread ideas that opposed the dogmatic autoritarian belief system and increased literacy in the progress. This in turn led (or at the very least greatly helped) to enlightment, scientific revolution and reformation. I believe the blockchain and bitcoin is an alternative to the dogmatic autoritarian system that is our current monetary system. And the understanding of the blockchain technology can lead to economic literacy.\nIt also coincides with the 6th/7th stage in the life cycles of great powers and the shift from greatly devaluated currency back to real money as it is explained here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdSq5H7awi8\nWhy are people so hung on the fact that our current monetary system is to big to fail. Do they believe we're at the pinnacle of social evolution and the political, economical and financial structures can't evolve any further? If you're looking at at all the events that happen in the world today we're slapped in the face with facts that the current status quo is starting to fall apart. The world is rebelling against the domination of the petrodollar, the formation of BRICS,.... The only way the dollar can uphold it's power is ultimatly through military power and as we have seen it's that very same military that siphons the wealth away from the empire that wields it.\nThe blockchain that can't exist without bitcoin (Andreas 'Anology' Antonopoulos explains this very well:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8y_GypCWf4\n) is a disruptive technology that can help society shapeshift into something more global. It enables global human economic interaction without the nationalistic connotations that are a burden on todays national fiat currencies and lead to devastating economical wrangling between nations. This doesn't mean the ones in power now suddenly won't be anymore but at least the'll have to alter the ways in which they siphon wealth from all of us and in the process we might get a bit of power back.\nFrom another discussion I cherrypicked the following: \"You are as much of slave to fiat as the rest of us.\"\nWhen I realised this a while ago, that was the moment I decided in order to try escape from this, I had to educate myself on how all this monetary shit really works. While educating myself I became flabbergasted by the level of oblivion we the sheeple have in regards to all these matters that rule our life.\nTo explain what I mean I'll again refer to the video series shown previously.( they did quite a good job to make it understandable)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0\nDo you also recognise how bitcoin creates an oppertunity to babystep out of this system and how it is invented out of an actual need?\nAnother thing I often hear is the fact that many hold on to their bitcoins and don't use them as a \"currency\" should be used. That is the whole situation backwards! It shows how brainwashed we are into our current system that we think it's a bad thing to be able to save a token that represents our labour instead of having to \"invest\" this token in order for it to remain of the same value. Or the simple fact that it encourages you to directly spend and live in the now instead of thinking about (and by doing so, questioning) the future. The more knowledgable I become about all of this the more I urge my mother, sisters, friends,.. to educate themselves and the more I'm convinced that dismissing Bitcoin is a mistake of a lifetime. Not recognizing the potential bitcoin holds, is mostly due to the fact that that we all have a tendency to dismiss change and hold on unto false and dogmatic premises. This could also explain why bitcoiners are often regarded and ridiculed to as a cult, one uses existing dominant templates as reference fields to compare new and unknown things.\nThe truth is, I wasn't interested in these kind of subjects like an illiterate isn't interested in getting information out of a book. The fact that I am now questioning and learning all of this leads me to believe that many more are becoming aware of this. After all, I'm not a special snowflake!\nThis gets me back to the beginning of this post so the circlejerk is completed.\n", "views": 834, "author": "Flatulenters Member Offline Activity: 71 Merit: 16 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe blockchain and it's timing in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-03-08 18:52:17", "content": "Hey, I've heard a lot about how the blockchain tech can change business and government but I've not yet read or heard a lot about the specifics.\nIt seems like the open record of the transactions and the community verification of the transactions could be the most useful element.

In any economy if no one spends money the economy can't grow (e.g., If we don't buy things, businesses don't make revenue, employees can't get paid, etc) and the economy will collapse.\nWe are all \"slaves\" to the government controlled currencies, and we may argue about to what degree, but that's only because the only independent currency in existence (bitcoin) is not yet mature enough to stand on its own...it's getting there though.\n", "author": "Possum577 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 434 Merit: 250 Loose lips sink sigs!

Revolution is a result of the existing social structures failing, and this failure is correlated with the financial health of that society.\nMy point is that bitcoin is a viable(better) alternative to the autoritarian, untransparant monetary system. An alternative that might lead to a beter awareness of the abuse and misuse of financial power that currently is in the hands of centralised entities that do with it as they please.\nI believe that the public awareness combined with this new technology could lead to a modernisation of our monetary system just like enlightment led to the evolution of our ideas about religion, art, science, filosofy and politics.\nThe monetary system is one aspect of society that didn't had an evolution during this big wave of modernisation because the basic conditions, namely the need of a trusted 3'd party did not change. The ideology that controls monetary system has seen different applications but the essence of how it works stayed the same.\nThis is what the blockchain is capable off. For the first time in 5000 years, we can have a monetary system that doesn't need and does'nt rise and fall with a central authority behind it. This is the first time we can have enlightment of money. Society and how the  monetary power is distributed to ensure we have a form of continuity can be fundamentally different for the first time.\nYou can entice people to spend their hard earned \"value\" other than hitting them with the stick that is called inflation.  Use a carrot instead! You'll just have to make it a better deal for people to spend it rather than save it all. Peoples needs don't go away after all.\nBtw, it's part of the illusion that the same value keeps getting pumped around right now. The truth is, it syphones out of the system you and I use and enters a private system that is the sole playground of the big entities that control the whole thing. Meaning, we spend and only they save.\n", "author": "Flatulenters Member Offline Activity: 71 Merit: 16 "}, {"date": "2015-03-08 22:00:00", "content": "I agree with a lot of what you're saying, not everything.\nFirst, what's the \"since 5000 years\" comment? What was the system before 5000 years ago? And the US has been off the gold standard for less than 50 years, which represents the time that the US Dollar was truly controlled by a private entity (rather than being valued against a global commodity).\nSecond, don't act like you can't \"siphon off value\" from current fiat systems for your own private wealth creation. Saving money is what you're describing and it seems you're pissed that the wealthy and corporations have the ability to control more money than you. Guess why they can do that, because 1) their families have saved money, therefore grown their wealth, and/or 2) they've found ways to earn money faster than everyone else. Both options are BEAUTIFUL human creations and within anyone's grasp based on the decisions they make and how they spend their time.\nYour bitching about the system is worthless if you're not willing to beat the system (by playing within it or finding a better way). Now, I believe you're probably doing that, but I just wanted to make the point.\nSave more than you spend. Let your earnings enter your own \"private system\" where you invest your money into smart operations to allow it to grow and compound. Stay away from debt as much as possible, the debt cycle is the enemy and excluding the need for higher education going into debt is largely a function of our own want to have luxuries now rather than save for them. No one needs a smart phone. No one needs to own a personal computer (go to the library). I think too many of us blame a system for taking advantage of our own dumb decisions.

We can download Ubuntu14.04.1 32bits desktop ISO file\nand burn it on CD。\n2, One USB stick,USB3.0 is better.\n3, Ubuntu14.04.1 32bits desktop ISO file from official site.\n4, Electrum software from official site.\nFile list：\nFile list：\n1，file：ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso\nmd5: a4fc15313ef2a516bfbf83ce44281535\nOfficial web page://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop\n2，file：Electrum-1.9.8.zip\nmd5: 0f91f548ba64b1f5776a28b1522f07ec\nOfficial web page：\nhttps://www.electrum.org/download.html\nThe MD5 values of Ubuntu and Electrum can be found on official site.\nDownload above files,and record MD5 values on text file for verify.\nMD5 value verify ways：\nWindows user：Download WinMD5Free software to verify file。\nLinux user： run md5sum filename .\nCreation steps\nⅠ. USB stick partition\nWe will create two partitions on USB stick and install OS on the second partition.\nBecause, Windows doesnt recognize the second partition. This strategy has extra\nprotection where the USB inserted in online windows machine carelessly.\n1,Boot from Ubuntu CD，select Try Ubuntu button, and insert USB stick.\n2,Click \"Dash Home button\"（top-left button）-&gt;input \"disk\"-&gt;Click \"Disks\"，create partition on the USB stick。\nⅡ. Create persistent Live-USB stick\nClick \"Dash Home button\"（top-left button）-&gt;input \"creator\"-&gt;Click \"Startup Disk Creator\"，（please select \"Stored in extra space\" option）。\nAfter persistent Live-USB stick creation completion, Boot form the USB stick on a offline PC.\nSelect Try Ubuntu button on welcome screen.\n(For Thinkpad PC, press F12 to open the Boot menu during system post.\nThe shortcut key is various. it may be F12,F2,F10 or ESC.\nif it doesnt works we need look up the computer reference.)\nⅢ.System settings.\nThe following steps all run in the terminal window.\n1,Change the password of the default user ubuntu (default password is blank)\nrun\nCode:\npasswd\n2，Disable desktop automatic login\nCode:\nsudo vi /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\nEdit content with the following：\nCode:\n[SeatDefaults]\nallow-guest=false\nautologin-guest=false\nautologin-user=\nautologin-user-timeout=0\nautologin-session=lightdm-autologin\ngreeter-show-manual-login=true\n3，Disable other terminal automatic login.\nCode:\nsudo rm /etc/init/tty*.conf\n4，Cancel Ubuntu weclome screen when boot.\nCode:\nsudo vi /media/cdrom/syslinux/syslinux.cfg\nEdit content with the following：\nCode:\ndefault live\nlabel live\nmenu label ^Try Ubuntu without installing\nkernel /casper/vmlinuz\nappend noprompt cdrom-detect/try-usb=true persistent file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\nⅣ. Create normal account and encrypted folder\n1,Create normal account richard.\n2,Login with new account: richard, create encrypted Private folder\nrun\nCode:\necryptfs-setup-private\n3,Change electrum to store wallet data in Private folder by default.\nElectrum store wallet data in .electrum folder under user home folder by default.( in\nthe sample is:/home/richard/.electrum)\nrun:\nCode:\ncd ~/Private\nmkdir .electrum\ncd ..\nln -s ~/Private/.electrum .electrum\nⅤ Close system network connection\nCommonly, the cold wallet computer must be disconnect from network physically.\nUnplug network cable and close WIFI switch if available.\nIn the step, we disconnect network on software layer.\n1,Click \"Dash Home button\"-&gt; input \"startup\" -&gt; click \"Startup Applications\"\n2,Add startup program： nmcli nm enable false\nⅥ Offline Install Electrum\n1.Login with new user:richard\n2.Copy Electrum-1.9.8.zip file to the new user home folder: /home/richard\n(we can use another clean USB stick to copy the file)\n3.Verify the file\nIn terminal window，goto the home folder.\nCode:\ncd ~\nmd5sum Electrum-1.9.8.zip\n0f91f548ba64b1f5776a28b1522f07ec Electrum-1.9.8.zip\nVerify the MD5 value to make sure it is the same as the value on official site exactly\n4.

It's a product of a need and means to a way. I think that it has great resemblences to the invention of the bookpress and printing. The bookpress was invented because it was a necessity at that time to easely spread ideas that opposed the dogmatic autoritarian belief system and increased literacy in the progress. This in turn led (or at the very least greatly helped) to enlightment, scientific revolution and reformation. I believe the blockchain and bitcoin is an alternative to the dogmatic autoritarian system that is our current monetary system. And the understanding of the blockchain technology can lead to economic literacy.\nIt also coincides with the 6th/7th stage in the life cycles of great powers and the shift from greatly devaluated currency back to real money as it is explained here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdSq5H7awi8\nWhy are people so hung on the fact that our current monetary system is to big to fail. Do they believe we're at the pinnacle of social evolution and the political, economical and financial structures can't evolve any further? If you're looking at at all the events that happen in the world today we're slapped in the face with facts that the current status quo is starting to fall apart. The world is rebelling against the domination of the petrodollar, the formation of BRICS,.... The only way the dollar can uphold it's power is ultimatly through military power and as we have seen it's that very same military that siphons the wealth away from the empire that wields it.\nThe blockchain that can't exist without bitcoin (Andreas 'Anology' Antonopoulos explains this very well:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8y_GypCWf4\n) is a disruptive technology that can help society shapeshift into something more global. It enables global human economic interaction without the nationalistic connotations that are a burden on todays national fiat currencies and lead to devastating economical wrangling between nations. This doesn't mean the ones in power now suddenly won't be anymore but at least the'll have to alter the ways in which they siphon wealth from all of us and in the process we might get a bit of power back.\nFrom another discussion I cherrypicked the following: \"You are as much of slave to fiat as the rest of us.\"\nWhen I realised this a while ago, that was the moment I decided in order to try escape from this, I had to educate myself on how all this monetary shit really works. While educating myself I became flabbergasted by the level of oblivion we the sheeple have in regards to all these matters that rule our life.\nTo explain what I mean I'll again refer to the video series shown previously.( they did quite a good job to make it understandable)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0\nDo you also recognise how bitcoin creates an oppertunity to babystep out of this system and how it is invented out of an actual need?\nAnother thing I often hear is the fact that many hold on to their bitcoins and don't use them as a \"currency\" should be used. That is the whole situation backwards! It shows how brainwashed we are into our current system that we think it's a bad thing to be able to save a token that represents our labour instead of having to \"invest\" this token in order for it to remain of the same value. Or the simple fact that it encourages you to directly spend and live in the now instead of thinking about (and by doing so, questioning) the future. The more knowledgable I become about all of this the more I urge my mother, sisters, friends,.. to educate themselves and the more I'm convinced that dismissing Bitcoin is a mistake of a lifetime. Not recognizing the potential bitcoin holds, is mostly due to the fact that that we all have a tendency to dismiss change and hold on unto false and dogmatic premises. This could also explain why bitcoiners are often regarded and ridiculed to as a cult, one uses existing dominant templates as reference fields to compare new and unknown things.\nThe truth is, I wasn't interested in these kind of subjects like an illiterate isn't interested in getting information out of a book. The fact that I am now questioning and learning all of this leads me to believe that many more are becoming aware of this. After all, I'm not a special snowflake!\nThis gets me back to the beginning of this post so the circlejerk is completed.\n", "views": 834, "author": "Flatulenters Member Offline Activity: 71 Merit: 16 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe blockchain and it's timing in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-03-08 18:52:17", "content": "Hey, I've heard a lot about how the blockchain tech can change business and government but I've not yet read or heard a lot about the specifics.\nIt seems like the open record of the transactions and the community verification of the transactions could be the most useful element.

Revolution is a result of the existing social structures failing, and this failure is correlated with the financial health of that society.\nMy point is that bitcoin is a viable(better) alternative to the autoritarian, untransparant monetary system. An alternative that might lead to a beter awareness of the abuse and misuse of financial power that currently is in the hands of centralised entities that do with it as they please.\nI believe that the public awareness combined with this new technology could lead to a modernisation of our monetary system just like enlightment led to the evolution of our ideas about religion, art, science, filosofy and politics.\nThe monetary system is one aspect of society that didn't had an evolution during this big wave of modernisation because the basic conditions, namely the need of a trusted 3'd party did not change. The ideology that controls monetary system has seen different applications but the essence of how it works stayed the same.\nThis is what the blockchain is capable off. For the first time in 5000 years, we can have a monetary system that doesn't need and does'nt rise and fall with a central authority behind it. This is the first time we can have enlightment of money. Society and how the  monetary power is distributed to ensure we have a form of continuity can be fundamentally different for the first time.\nYou can entice people to spend their hard earned \"value\" other than hitting them with the stick that is called inflation.  Use a carrot instead! You'll just have to make it a better deal for people to spend it rather than save it all. Peoples needs don't go away after all.\nBtw, it's part of the illusion that the same value keeps getting pumped around right now. The truth is, it syphones out of the system you and I use and enters a private system that is the sole playground of the big entities that control the whole thing. Meaning, we spend and only they save.\n", "author": "Flatulenters Member Offline Activity: 71 Merit: 16 "}, {"date": "2015-03-08 22:00:00", "content": "I agree with a lot of what you're saying, not everything.\nFirst, what's the \"since 5000 years\" comment? What was the system before 5000 years ago? And the US has been off the gold standard for less than 50 years, which represents the time that the US Dollar was truly controlled by a private entity (rather than being valued against a global commodity).\nSecond, don't act like you can't \"siphon off value\" from current fiat systems for your own private wealth creation. Saving money is what you're describing and it seems you're pissed that the wealthy and corporations have the ability to control more money than you. Guess why they can do that, because 1) their families have saved money, therefore grown their wealth, and/or 2) they've found ways to earn money faster than everyone else. Both options are BEAUTIFUL human creations and within anyone's grasp based on the decisions they make and how they spend their time.\nYour bitching about the system is worthless if you're not willing to beat the system (by playing within it or finding a better way). Now, I believe you're probably doing that, but I just wanted to make the point.\nSave more than you spend. Let your earnings enter your own \"private system\" where you invest your money into smart operations to allow it to grow and compound. Stay away from debt as much as possible, the debt cycle is the enemy and excluding the need for higher education going into debt is largely a function of our own want to have luxuries now rather than save for them. No one needs a smart phone. No one needs to own a personal computer (go to the library). I think too many of us blame a system for taking advantage of our own dumb decisions.

In situations where what is being observed is truly random (i.e., independent trials of a random process), this belief, though appealing to the human mind, is false.\n", "author": "DannyHamilton Legendary Offline Activity: 2198 Merit: 1371 "}, {"date": "2015-03-06 19:40:13", "content": "statistically the blocks are being generated faster than 10min.\nCheck the expected time of halvings and the real time of the halvings to confirm it\nExactly, the next halving is slowly coming sooner and sooner.

I think \"oh, how unlucky the miners have been, but that's good, then they should find a new block any second now.\"\nIs that correct, or should I expect the average time until a new block is 10min no matter how long ago the last block was created?\nNo, this is not correct.  If you see that the last block was created 60 mins ago then the expected waiting time until the next block is 10 minutes and the expected length of time between the current block and the next block is 70 mins.\nIf blocks are solved every 10 minutes on average, then shouldn't the average answer to the question \"How long do I need to wait until the next block is solved?\" be 5 minutes?\nGood question.  You've stumbled into a probability paradox.\nConsider also that the block-generating process looks exactly the same with time reversed.  If you select points in time uniformly (between 2010-01-01 and 2012-12-31 say) you'll find that the next block is, on average, 10 minutes into the future just as you find that the previous block is, on average, 10 minutes into the past.  You'll find that the average time interval between the previous and next blocks is indeed 20 minutes!\nIn this case the marks aren't evenly spaced, but I have trouble seeing why that matters over a long timespan since the intervals average out to once per 10 minutes.\nResolving the paradox:\nSelecting a block at random is different to selecting a point in time at random.  When selecting a point in time at random you're more likely to land between blocks which are far apart than blocks which are close together.  Your averages are then biased towards longer waiting times.\n", "author": "teukon Legendary Offline Activity: 1246 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-03-06 22:36:16", "content": "While the expected time between blocks is 10 minutes the time until the next block is unknown.  The expected waiting time for a block in isolation is not very useful because it doesn't tell you the whole story instead it is more useful to look at the distribution of possible values and use probability to provide a level of confidence of how long the next block will take.   Often the question that is behind the question asked is \"What is the probability that my txn will be confirmed in the next x minutes?\"\nConsider these two questions:\n1) Right now what is the probability that the next block will be found in 10 minutes or less?\n2) What is the length of time such that there is a 50% probability that the next block will be found in that amount of time or less?\nSome people incorrectly think the answers are 50% and 10 minutes respectively but that isn't correct.  While the expected block time has a mean of 10 minutes the distribution is not linear.  We can use a CDF (cumulative distribution function) to graph the probability of the next block being found in the next x minutes.\nCDF (Bitcoin Blocks = mean of 10 minutes)\n50%    6.9 minutes\n63%   10.0 minutes\n80%   16.9 minutes\n90%   22.8 minutes\n99%   42.0 minutes\nSo the answer to the two questions above are 63% and 6.9 minutes respectively.  Some rounded easy to remember numbers as a rule of thumb 50% chance of of txn being confirmed in &lt;7 minutes, 75% chance of being confirmed in in &lt;15 minutes, 90% in less than a half an hour, and &gt;99% in an hour.   As others have pointed out that is always time from 'now'.  If I submit a txn there is a 50% chance the next block will be found in less than seven minutes but if two hours pass the probability from that point is still 50% chance in the next seven minutes.\nAll this assumes hashrate is constant and actual difficulty matches the expected difficulty for the hashrate.\n", "author": "DeathAndTaxes Donator Legendary Offline Activity: 1218 Merit: 1005 Gerald Davis "}, {"date": "2015-03-06 23:06:25", "content": "For every block that takes an hour, there should be one that takes a few seconds.\nTrue, but...\nIf you \"suffer through\" an unusually long streak (high wait time for blocks, dice rolls under 7, etc), then at some point you have to get fast blocks or high dice rolls in order for the stats to normalize.
