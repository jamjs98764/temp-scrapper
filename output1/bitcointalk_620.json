If Amazon recognizes the advantages to merchants (no counterfeiting, chargebacks, credit card fees, etc.) and offers a modest discount (say, 2%) to those paying with bitcoin, then people will convert cash to bitcoin to make their purchases at Amazon. This will cancel out the selling pressure if Amazon doesn't hold the bitcoins.\nOf course, it's also possible that Amazon begins to use bitcoin with its vendors once it starts accepting it.

This will cancel out the selling pressure if Amazon doesn't hold the bitcoins.\nOf course, it's also possible that Amazon begins to use bitcoin with its vendors once it starts accepting it.
