I've used bitcoin to exchange for goods with other bitcoiners, I do not support big companies who use bitcoin as a liquid item to dump for fiat. These people ruin BTC. They don't care what the BTC is worth, they only care about how fast it can be changed over to cash. Imagine you woke up tomorrow and BTC rocketed up to $1000.

I'm pretty surprised people think BTC will be worth 10k lol.\nHalf a million btc? You do realize there's only ever going to be 21 million total?\n10k is probably far fetched\nbut remember bitcoin was 1k with practically zero adoption. Imagine what would happen if we get mass adoption and it is used frequently all around the world? Then 10k wouldn't be so ridiculous in my opinion.\nWall Street went crazy saying Berkshire Hathaway's class A shares were overvalued when they hit $10,000 for the first time. In 2006, those Class A shares crossed over $100,000 per share. Less than 10 years later, they closed this week at nearly $225,000 per share.\nWith adoption and being at such an early stage with BTC, I don't see $10,000 all that far fetched after the next halving (or two). Bitcoin can (has already, to a small degree) revolutionize the payment industry with countless more utility uses. If we can stave off the ADD somewhat, the value per BTC could be beyond some of the most optimistic predictions.\n", "author": "tins Hero Member Offline Activity: 602 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-01-17 08:02:48", "content": "1000 btc will be enough for me.

Many of these will be overcome with time but for now I think they are holding it back.\nAcquisition\n- Too difficult to get (fiat =&gt; Bitcoin, Bitcoin =&gt; fiat)\nTrust\n- With exchanges being hacked or acting as Ponzis, trust is a very big concern. Someday, perhaps, exchanges will be unneccessary but for now, there are no laws or oversight like there are with banks. If you're going to trade fiat for Bitcoin, you're going to have to trust them, whether it is Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, or the next company that hasn't yet hit the news. You could buy locally. Although a personal exchange is probably safer because you're there, there is always the possibility of being robbed so you're going to have to trust them.\nSecurity\n- I just read about cold storage being hacked this morning. I worry that my smartphone could be lost or hacked. I worry that there could be a keylogger on my PC. I get an uneasy feeling everytime I login and spend some Bitcoin. I worry if I keep a backup on a piece of paper somewhere that it could get lost, stolen, burnt up in a fire, etc.\nEducation\n- I think we are, compared to the timeline of the Internet, in the early days of computing where getting on and using the Internet was easy for a few. But most people didn't know what a modem was, how to install it, how to use it, what a BBS was, how to find a POP, what the Internet was useful for, how to use a BBS or even a browser. The average user just found it all too difficult. Today, I think the biggest challenge the\naverage\nperson faces is understanding best practices such as creating a password they can remember, yet is difficult enough. Or how to keep a backup. Or how to generally be safe and secure and get a warm fuzzy feeling whenever they use Bitcoin and not a very uneasy feeling that they could be doing something wrong and may someday find their life savings has been liberated from them and there is no one (FBI, FDIC, etc.) they can turn to to get it back.\nConfirmation times\n- 10 minutes to an hour is not a problem for many online transactions but there are circumstances when that wait is just too long, especially with in person transactions.\nTaxation\n- Either you shirk your responsibilities to pay taxes on your gains with Bitcoin and hope you never get caught or you somehow have to keep track of it all and try to reconcile your taxes. Either way it sucks.\nStigma\n- There is a lot of bad stigma when it comes to Bitcoin. People correlate Mt. Gox being hacked to Bitcoin being hacked, obviously not the same thing. Or they think it is only useful for nefarious purposes, i.e. Silk Road. Or they think it is just some Ponzi scheme designed to part suckers from their money. People also used to think the Internet was only useful for watching porn. They'll come around, eventually.\nVolatility\n- Why would someone spend their Bitcoin today when they think it will be worth more tomorrow and more the day after that? Holding Bitcoin for any length of time would be an issue for most people watching the price go up and down. If they only plan to hold it for a short term so that they can spend it then volatility is moot. But, see point #1 above. When it is too difficult to convert one to the other then it becomes too difficult to buy and spend it fast enough to not be affected by the volatility. I think volatility will someday not be so much of an issue once Bitcoin is mainstream but it will be a long and rocky road getting to that point.\nInvestor mentality\n- There are plenty of reasons to\nUSE\nBitcoin. Here is just one example. A worker in America collects a paycheck every other week and wants to send a portion of each paycheck back home to his family in India. As soon as his money is reconciled in his bank account, he buys some Bitcoin from some provider where his price is guaranteed from the moment he bought it (even though it may take a few days to actually receive the Bitcoin). As soon as he gets the bitcoins he sends them off to his family and sends an email to notify them of the transaction. As soon as they receive it, they sell those bitcoins to a provider who guarantees the price at the time of the transaction (even though it may take a few days for their fiat to get into their bank account). Here is a person who is using Bitcoin for one of the\nmany\nthings it is good for and who is completely unaffected by the current price (whether $1,000 or $100 is completely irrelevant in this case), and is minimally impacted by volatility. He may have gained or lost a few dollars during the whole course but he could gain or he could lose. It would average out vs. sending the money via a moneygram or wire transfer where he is guaranteed to spend a lot of money for each transaction ($50 at my bank to send an international wire transfer). But many people today buy Bitcoin strictly as an investment vehicle (I'll admit I am hodling too but I don't jump on the bandwagon when the price starts going up and panic when it starts going down either). Their speculation WILL and HAS already caused bubbles in Bitcoin. Every time the bubble bursts it is a black eye for Bitcoin as a whole and the idiots say, \"I told you so\". Hopefully someday Bitcoin will find its value and hold a somewhat stable price causing people to stop wanting to invest in it so much. But people will ALWAYS speculate with Bitcoin, unfortunately.\nThreat to current money businesses\n- I believe Bitcoin is already at war with the central banks and other money businesses, such as credit card companies, payment processors, the IRS, etc. They perceive it as a threat to their business and they pull a ton of power in goverments around the world. They will try to use propaganda and laws to prevent its widestream acceptance.\n", "author": "keelba Member Offline Activity: 104 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2015-01-16 20:30:36", "content": "people that it have money ... are old.\nthey prefer\nGOLD\nover bitcoin.\nwait a new generation for this.\n", "author": "Meuh6879 Legendary Offline Activity: 1512 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-01-16 20:31:39", "content": "Public perception of bitcoin is a significant issue too, but I guess it's human nature to form opinions about something you know nothing about\n", "author": "rexxarofmoknathal Sr. Member Offline Activity: 403 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-01-18 13:09:17", "content": "transaction times.\n", "author": "becker Full Member Offline Activity: 146 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-01-18 13:13:23", "content": "All other issues can be overcome except incentive.

Add in that they are among the top natural gas producers, top hydro-electricity producers, top nuclear power producers, and have significant coal reserves and wind energy projects, and the prospect of losing an \"energy war\" to even a united middle east becomes somewhat remote.\nAnd yeah, all the middle east countries working together?\nDon't forget also that that oil is all they've got, basically no other significant natural resources, no forests, no rolling prairies full of wheat, no thousands of freshwater lakes, no uranium deposits, limited minerals and metals....\nBasically their current policy is enough like an all or nothing game of chicken for them, I doubt they will take any increased risk.\nPersonally I think they are a day late and a dollar short on this price dump, for a start, with the development of tar sands and shale oil etc, they no longer hold the trump, they're just a large fraction, rather than a majority. Now, they can kill production on those fields in the race to the bottom, their oil is cheaper to get out of the ground. But, too late, infrastructure is there, it will just get mothballed, we'll just freaking buy up  every last barrel, and given their \"extremely optimistic\" proved reserve numbers, those last barrels will be coming out sooner than they think. Then what, western companies will pour billions into developing marginal resources in middle east? Don't think so, not any more. I think they'd rather spend $3 anywhere else in the world than $2 in middle east again.\nBut anyway, good luck to them..... as long as they save enough cash to buy some CANDUs\n", "author": "Flashman Hero Member Offline Activity: 518 Merit: 500 Hodl!

I really doubt the Saudis are that dumb as they can't do it for very long and they're just selling oil for a discount(not very economically feasible). I would suspect there have been some backroom deals with the USA and Saudi Arabia, potentially involving ISIS and Russia. Can't anyone remember in April when the US started selling reserves to bring down the price of oil. I think it went from around $105 to $80 in about a month. They specifically said this was a warning shot to Russia over Crimea. Then ISIS emerged and Saudi needed a tactical ally to stop the advancement towards their boarders.\n", "author": "General_A Member Offline Activity: 70 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2015-01-02 14:07:00", "content": "That's a possibility, that US is dangling F-35s or something under Saudi's nose as a carrot to play ball for the Russian reasons.\n", "author": "Flashman Hero Member Offline Activity: 518 Merit: 500 Hodl!

However, it only produces about 30 million barrels of oil per day (since not all the oil in the ground is taken out at once).\nA single barrel of oil can be harnessed to produce about 1.7 megawatts of electricity. Therefore, 30 million barrels of oil is equal to about 51 terawatts.\nA current state-of-the-art miner such as the Antminer S5 uses just 0.51 watts per GH/s. If the Middle East decided to shut down oil exports and consumption for one day and instead dedicated it all towards attacking Bitcoin, 51 terawatts of electricity would be enough to supply a total hashrate of exactly 100 billion terahashes. The current hashrate of the Bitcoin network is roughly about 300,000 terahashes. This would give the Middle East about 99.9997 percent of the total hashrate of the entire network.\nYou can also do the same calculations for other countries and groups of countries too. See how much electricity they consume and then imagine if they dedicated all of that towards attacking Bitcoin. OK, so maybe not all of the electricity used in one day would be used to attack Bitcoin in a hypothetical attack scenario but even if a medium sized nation decided to dedicate only 10 percent of its typical per-day electrical consumption towards performing an attack, the results are still pretty terrifying.\nit could be.

We don't have this information, we know only that he was chatting with DPR. To be admin for a web like this is not easy to be accepted. Or maybe that \"admin\" is the creator of the SK.\n- If that agent has access to see the location of DPR just chatting, why they didn't localize also all the clients that used SK to sell/buy drogs.

Maybe 10% of the countries in the world have managed to achieve something like this 10% of the time. In many cases it has appeared to be achieved but been proven a fragile illusion. In the current global financial climate, no country has natural immunity. Truly it is unstoppable, it is inevitable. The only question is, how long the patients fight it, and whether they will then surrender and enter symbiosis sooner rather than later. In that regard it's a virus that's more like gut bacteria, in the end it strengthens the host. However in the process of becoming infected, the patients might try ridiculous extreme measures, like blood letting, burning their hair, drinking mercury, one hundred kinds of quackery that may either bring their demise, hasten colonisation of the virus, or just bring pain and suffering unnecessarily.\nLike the flu, it will have high mutagenic potential, this years flu vaccine will be ineffective against next years strain, bitcoin is in the wild, the wilderness tests it, shapes it, makes it stronger. Bitcoin is as great an innovation as the printing press. Governments and tyrants have sought to control printing and mass dissemination of information, this has proved impossible, we came out of the dark ages, into the age of enlightenment. We are the vanguard of a new age upon this earth, the tide of history rises behind us.\n", "author": "Flashman Hero Member Offline Activity: 518 Merit: 500 Hodl!

What you're advocating isn't freedom, it's suppression. If you've ever taken drugs(Highly addictive ones i.e crystal meth etc) before or know someone who has, then you'd know that those things don't give people freedom, it takes it away.\nYou, grendel25, is the perfect example of why we need centralization in matters like this. What Ross did was wrong and also right in some respects. He brought the drug exchange to the internet in a simple way, which probably helped curb the violence usually seen in drug trades on the streets. But, he also made drugs more easily accessible to people, especially minors.\nIt's in my honest opinion, that I believe online drug markets should be allowed, with the exception that the exchange of child pornography be completely and wholly banned and that anyone buying drugs be over the age of 21, and the markets should be overseen and monitored by the \"feds\". The site administrators and staff(as well as the vendors) should be on the lookout for minors trying to get drugs and report them, and definitely on the lookout for the exchange of child pornography. Such exchanges might help stop the violence seen with drug trades IRL, along with making things like this a lot safer and more democratic.\n**Of course if the site administrators don't listen and abide by those rules, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law**\n", "author": "darkota Hero Member Online Activity: 714 Merit: 500 ONe Social Network "}, {"date": "2015-01-18 02:23:57", "content": "[quote athor=DarthCoinX link=topic=927750.msg10185804#msg10185804 date=1421501417]\nhttp://imgur.com/07VStSK\nAnd something to read more about:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2smm94/silk_road_case_just_another_fakery/\nAlso the post was deleted after few minutes:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2sqacm/this_reddit_sub_is_censoring_posts/\n[/quote]Anybody can show this shit face.\n", "author": "Agestorzrxx Sr. Member Offline Activity: 462 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-01-18 02:29:02", "content": "http://imgur.com/07VStSK\nAnd something to read more about:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2smm94/silk_road_case_just_another_fakery/\nAlso the post was deleted after few minutes:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2sqacm/this_reddit_sub_is_censoring_posts/\nOne flaw in it, as far as price goes drugs give bitcoin a baseline value.

Therefore, it is correct to assume that\nif\nthe device is compromised, you could lose the BTC stored on it.\nCan the device be compromised? For instance, can the attacker convince it to run software supplied by the attacker?\nFrom time to time, the firmware on the device has to be updated. The update is downloaded from the site of the producer and signed with several (3? Don't recall any more) secret keys of the developers. The signatures are checked with the public keys of the developers, which are stored in the firmware of the device. Can this process be subverted?\nIf the PC downloading the new firmware is compromised, the malware on it can modify the new firmware - but it would invalidate the signatures. Therefore, a different approach is needed.\nOne possibility is if the signing (secret) keys of the developers are compromised - either by a disgruntled employee, or because they go rogue, or because the company is hacked. Such things have happened in the past. However,\nseveral\nkeys would have to be compromised (and the breach not noticed); just one would not be enough. While not impossible, I consider this highly unlikely.\nThere is another approach, however - one that exploits not cryptography but human nature. We call is \"social engineering\" but it's basically lying and manipulation. Suppose that the malware on the compromised PC intercepts all communications to and from the company server and changes the firmware update page. It puts a HUGE warning that the company's keys have been compromised, there are new ones and the new firmware is signed with them, so trust us and ignore any warnings from the device - with screen shots of what to do and everything. (The same thing can be achieved by hacking the company's site - but that would be noticed and fixed fast enough.)\nWhile many people will realize that something is fishy, many more would not.

It would be nice to see some docs about how to do this.\nThe biggest part of the problem was becoming familiar with compiling software and installing it on the operating systems that were involved:  Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7.  Initially, I just focused on Ubuntu.  I started out running it in a VMware virtual machine (free version) that ran under Window 7, but this was interfering with the performance of other things I use the machine for, so I spend $300 and put together an Atom based Intel NUC system with 120 GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM.  I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on this machine.  Initially I was using a spare keyboard and mouse and VGA display, but after I got the system running OK and set up SSH I have managed the system headless using PUTTY from my Windows 7 machine.\nI went to the Electrum web site and then to Github and found the instructions for installing Electrum Server, which involve building it from source. This was pretty straightforward, just involved tracing down some dependencies.  I am no Linux expert, so a certain amount of Googling was needed to interpret error messages and figure out how to do things, such as increasing the number of open files.  The first part of the directions was to build a bitcoin node from source on this machine.  After I got this working, and installed on the system and it seemed to be working OK, I moved on to the electrum server and got it to work with electrum clients on one of my other machines (the release version, not the Trezor version. At this point I was running a couple of PUTTY terminal windows.  The last thing to do on this box was to rig it so that bitcoind and Electrum server started up automatically at boot. The machine runs unattended and draws almost no power (less than 15 watts) and sits behind a  UPS, so it does not glitch with my frequent power interruptions.  The Electrum Server is not very robust and if the system is shut down without waiting for the Electrum server to finish processing, the database can be corrupted and this can take hours to recover, so don't do this.\nThe next step was to get an Electrum 2.0 client running.  I did this first under an Ubuntu virtual machine on my Windows system. The directions are at the Electrum git-hub site. Again, some tracing down dependencies and loading them with apt-get.  At this point the next step was to get the Trezor running.  This requires installation of appropriate routines to allow Python programs to access the Trezor via the USB. This is the Python Trezor code, also available from Github. It includes a \"hello world\" test program to verify that a Python program can talk to the Trezor.  I ran into one obscure problem getting this to work. I had to find the utility to see what was going on on the (virtual) USB, bypassing the \"Cython\" wrapper that connected Python to the C code that talked to the USB. I thought something was seriously broken, but then I discovered that everything worked fine so long as I was running as root.  Once I set up the USB protections so the account used for the my normal login was permitted to access the Trezor (both read and write) then everything was fine.  At this point it was just a matter of starting with no wallets in the .electrum directory and Electrum 2.0 prompted me for the rest and my Trezor based wallet showed up.\nI ran this way for a month.  Eventually, I got bored and curious and figured out how to get Electrum 2.0 to run under Windows 7.  This involved installing Python, Python-Qt and a development environment for C code.  This was another learning experience on my part, but it was all possible by downloading free software.  I got waylaid for a few hours until I realized that the free C compiler I had used was only 32 bits, and so I had to redownload and reinstall the appropriate versions of Python and Python-Qt.\nFor someone with more skill that I had, all of this would be an easy process.  The longest time required was the time for the initial download and block sync of bitcoind and the downloading of the electrum server database and initial sync of the electrum server.   If all you want to do is use Trezor via Electrum, none of this server work is needed, but then you will have to trust the electrum servers, which means you had better not be paranoid.\nI deliberately picked a low end Intel Nuc (1.4 GHz single core) for a server machine  to see if it would be fast enough. It takes less than 10 percent of CPU time for bitcoind to keep up with the network, even where 1 MB blocks are back to back.  I can't say as much for the Electrum Server.  The CPU seems to be saturated and uses about 30-40 percent of the CPU on this slow machine for large blocks.  This seems unnecessary, as I understand it, but I don't know enough about Python to know how to profile the software and speed it up.  (I'm sure that this can be done, because running an Electrum Server doesn't involve verifying transactions in the block chain, which is the time consuming part of bitcoin processing.  The server is just doing database processing which ought to be lightening fast with 8 GB of RAM and an SSD.)\nI would not recommend doing this if you aren't already an expert or (as in my case) you \"enjoy\" learning experiences. :-)\nhttps://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-server\nhttps://github.com/spesmilo/electrum\nhttps://github.com//trezor/python-trezor\n", "author": "tl121 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 279 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 19:30:30", "content": "AFAIK, the Trezor has a hardware random device so the random numbers it produces should be good.  Just in case, it also adds random numbers from the computer on first initialization.\nBut if you really want to, you can enter your own seed generated from dice rolls.

If you go this way, you need to trust the computer where you compute the sequence.\nYou should never enter the 12/18/24 word sequence directly into a computer.  If you restore the Trezor from backup it will ask for the words in a random order (on its own display), so even if the javascript code or the local computer is compromised, it will not know the order of the words.  Of course, knowing which words occur in the sequence drastically reduces the security of the sequence.\nFirmware updates have to be sent manually to the trezor using a special procedure involving pressing both buttons while connecting the trezor to the computer.  So even if the firmware keys are compromised, an attacker has to convince you to make a firmware update.  So if you check the social networks for announcements before doing a firmware update you should be fine.  Another problem may be an unknown bug (0day exploit) in the current firmware.  Still an attacker needs to compromise first your computer or the mytrezor domain or the client you use to access the Trezor and second the Trezor firmware.\n", "author": "johoe Full Member Offline Activity: 217 Merit: 103 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 19:32:46", "content": "I will send Slush link to this thread, he may answer you...\n", "author": "sase007 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 364 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 19:40:09", "content": "I will send Slush link to this thread, he may answer you...\nIt has already been answered on the first page\n", "author": "SirChiko Legendary Offline Activity: 980 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 19:54:46", "content": "The private keys of your trezor never go out from it, and you can always check in its screen the transaction parameters to see if they are correct or not.\nI have not seen yet any trezor hack.\nBoy wouldn't it suck to find out one day that the Trezor devices were simply using wifi to transmit the information on them?\nThere are so many suspicious infommerical-sounding posts for the Trezor all over the internet right now, I really wonder how many are legit.\nIn my opinion, you have to be a complete idiot to trust your money to any electronic device, provided by any 3rd party, for any reason whatsoever right now.\nPaper wallets all the way.\n-B-\n", "author": "BittBurger Hero Member Offline Activity: 868 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 19:59:14", "content": "Trezor is one of the most secures ways to have your bitcoins stored.\nI don't agree, paper wallet or offline computer wallet is more secure and free\nA paper backup is a quite safe method to protect bitcoins, but you still need to load private keys from paper using a trusted computer to send your coins to somebody else - please see the docs -\nhttp://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-faq/differences.html\n", "author": "kamilosa Member Offline Activity: 61 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 20:08:56", "content": "The private keys of your trezor never go out from it, and you can always check in its screen the transaction parameters to see if they are correct or not.\nI have not seen yet any trezor hack.\nBoy wouldn't it suck to find out one day that the Trezor devices were simply using wifi to transmit the information on them?\nThere are so many suspicious infommerical-sounding posts for the Trezor all over the internet right now, I really wonder how many are legit.\nIn my opinion, you have to be a complete idiot to trust your money to any electronic device, provided by any 3rd party, for any reason whatsoever right now.\nPaper wallets all the way.\n-B-\nPlease read the docs first\nhttp://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/securityphilosophy.html\n.

On January 13th, one who may have done just that went on trial in federal court in Manhattan, accused of drug-trafficking, money-laundering and operating a criminal enterprise. Ross Ulbricht, a 30-year-old Texan physics graduate, is accused of being Dread Pirate Roberts, the founder and administrator of the Silk Road. This was the first website to make it possible to buy and sell illegal drugs online openly and with relative anonymity. His trial will raise questions not only about the extent and nature of cybercrime, but also about the limits of government snooping necessary to prevent it.\nThe Silk Road was shut down by the FBI at the end of 2013. It worked by combining two new technologies: Tor, which allows people to host websites without revealing where they are based, and bitcoin, a decentralised online currency which offers a close digital alternative to a bag of unmarked banknotes. On the site, buyers and sellers could trade with remarkable discretion. Over two years, deals generated 9.5m bitcoin in sales (worth $1.8 billion today, though the exchange rate has fluctuated wildly) and over 600,000 bitcoin in commission. That is enough booty to make Blackbeard throw away his cutlass and pick up a mouse.\nThe prosecution has already produced evidence that Mr Ulbricht was Dread Pirate Roberts. They argue that he left a digital trail, administering the Silk Road through unencrypted connections and using his personal e-mail address to look for technical help. More sensationally, they allege that he not only set up the site, but sought to defend it violently. As the Dread Pirate, Mr Ulbricht is accused of paying for the assassinations of several people who threatened the site, including one former employee. None of these murders seems to have happened, but they prevented Mr Ulbricht from being granted bail after his arrest in 2013.\nMr Ulbricht says he was framed: the real Dread Pirates remain at large. His lawyers also claim that the FBI may have used illegal methods to identify and seize the Icelandic server on which the Silk Road was hosted, and from which much of the evidence comes. The FBI says the site contained a vulnerability which revealed where it really was, despite Tor. But several technical specialists think this implausible. Sadly for Mr Ulbricht, it may not matter much. In a ruling in October, a judge concluded that since he has not admitted any legal interest in the Silk Road server, he is unable to claim under the Fourth Amendment that it was illegally searched, and so the evidence from the server is admissible however it was found. This, the judge admitted, might appear to place Ulbricht in a catch-22. If he admits to an interest in the server, he would weaken his defence at his trial; if he doesnt, he has no chance of getting the evidence against him dismissed.\nMr Ulbrichts defence, which has been generously funded by online donations, is thus likely to focus on the strength of the evidence linking him to the online activities of Dread Pirate Roberts. Nonetheless, cyber-criminalsas well as other users of the dark webwill be watching closely. Since the Silk Road was taken offline, several similar market-places have been started, and many closed by the authorities. But it is still far from clear whether police forces can crack the anonymity given by technology such as Tor, or how deeply they can legitimately snoop on the web to uncloak the hosts of criminal networks.\nSOURCE:\nhttp://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21639525-one-dread-pirate-trial-what-about-others-bitcoin-buccaneers\n", "views": 351, "author": "Coinbuddy Hero Member Offline Activity: 896 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Silk Road trial | THE ECONOMIST\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-01-16 16:29:30"}], "posts": [{"content": "if we are going to put usd value to bitcoin how much do you think you would need to hold in btc to become a millionaire in the next 5 years?\n", "views": 3237, "author": "Jungle Star Newbie Offline Activity: 2 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow much Bitcoin do you think you would need to hold to become a millionaire?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-01-15 23:42:20", "content": "if we are going to put usd value to bitcoin how much do you think you would need to hold in btc to become a millionaire in the next 5 years?\nThis will require you to buy 5 bitcoin today.  Buy 5 bitcoin, hold them, sell them in 5 years - you will have over a million.  No problem.\n", "author": "DGulari Legendary Offline Activity: 1161 Merit: 1000 Create Your Decentralized Life "}, {"date": "2015-01-15 23:42:45", "content": "at least 1000.\n", "author": "tokeweed Legendary Offline Activity: 1890 Merit: 1031 Life, Love and Laughter...

I'm pretty surprised people think BTC will be worth 10k lol.\nHalf a million btc? You do realize there's only ever going to be 21 million total?\n10k is probably far fetched\nbut remember bitcoin was 1k with practically zero adoption. Imagine what would happen if we get mass adoption and it is used frequently all around the world? Then 10k wouldn't be so ridiculous in my opinion.\nWall Street went crazy saying Berkshire Hathaway's class A shares were overvalued when they hit $10,000 for the first time. In 2006, those Class A shares crossed over $100,000 per share. Less than 10 years later, they closed this week at nearly $225,000 per share.\nWith adoption and being at such an early stage with BTC, I don't see $10,000 all that far fetched after the next halving (or two). Bitcoin can (has already, to a small degree) revolutionize the payment industry with countless more utility uses. If we can stave off the ADD somewhat, the value per BTC could be beyond some of the most optimistic predictions.\n", "author": "tins Hero Member Offline Activity: 602 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-01-17 08:02:48", "content": "1000 btc will be enough for me.

Many of these will be overcome with time but for now I think they are holding it back.\nAcquisition\n- Too difficult to get (fiat =&gt; Bitcoin, Bitcoin =&gt; fiat)\nTrust\n- With exchanges being hacked or acting as Ponzis, trust is a very big concern. Someday, perhaps, exchanges will be unneccessary but for now, there are no laws or oversight like there are with banks. If you're going to trade fiat for Bitcoin, you're going to have to trust them, whether it is Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, or the next company that hasn't yet hit the news. You could buy locally. Although a personal exchange is probably safer because you're there, there is always the possibility of being robbed so you're going to have to trust them.\nSecurity\n- I just read about cold storage being hacked this morning. I worry that my smartphone could be lost or hacked. I worry that there could be a keylogger on my PC. I get an uneasy feeling everytime I login and spend some Bitcoin. I worry if I keep a backup on a piece of paper somewhere that it could get lost, stolen, burnt up in a fire, etc.\nEducation\n- I think we are, compared to the timeline of the Internet, in the early days of computing where getting on and using the Internet was easy for a few. But most people didn't know what a modem was, how to install it, how to use it, what a BBS was, how to find a POP, what the Internet was useful for, how to use a BBS or even a browser. The average user just found it all too difficult. Today, I think the biggest challenge the\naverage\nperson faces is understanding best practices such as creating a password they can remember, yet is difficult enough. Or how to keep a backup. Or how to generally be safe and secure and get a warm fuzzy feeling whenever they use Bitcoin and not a very uneasy feeling that they could be doing something wrong and may someday find their life savings has been liberated from them and there is no one (FBI, FDIC, etc.) they can turn to to get it back.\nConfirmation times\n- 10 minutes to an hour is not a problem for many online transactions but there are circumstances when that wait is just too long, especially with in person transactions.\nTaxation\n- Either you shirk your responsibilities to pay taxes on your gains with Bitcoin and hope you never get caught or you somehow have to keep track of it all and try to reconcile your taxes. Either way it sucks.\nStigma\n- There is a lot of bad stigma when it comes to Bitcoin. People correlate Mt. Gox being hacked to Bitcoin being hacked, obviously not the same thing. Or they think it is only useful for nefarious purposes, i.e. Silk Road. Or they think it is just some Ponzi scheme designed to part suckers from their money. People also used to think the Internet was only useful for watching porn. They'll come around, eventually.\nVolatility\n- Why would someone spend their Bitcoin today when they think it will be worth more tomorrow and more the day after that? Holding Bitcoin for any length of time would be an issue for most people watching the price go up and down. If they only plan to hold it for a short term so that they can spend it then volatility is moot. But, see point #1 above. When it is too difficult to convert one to the other then it becomes too difficult to buy and spend it fast enough to not be affected by the volatility. I think volatility will someday not be so much of an issue once Bitcoin is mainstream but it will be a long and rocky road getting to that point.\nInvestor mentality\n- There are plenty of reasons to\nUSE\nBitcoin. Here is just one example. A worker in America collects a paycheck every other week and wants to send a portion of each paycheck back home to his family in India. As soon as his money is reconciled in his bank account, he buys some Bitcoin from some provider where his price is guaranteed from the moment he bought it (even though it may take a few days to actually receive the Bitcoin). As soon as he gets the bitcoins he sends them off to his family and sends an email to notify them of the transaction. As soon as they receive it, they sell those bitcoins to a provider who guarantees the price at the time of the transaction (even though it may take a few days for their fiat to get into their bank account). Here is a person who is using Bitcoin for one of the\nmany\nthings it is good for and who is completely unaffected by the current price (whether $1,000 or $100 is completely irrelevant in this case), and is minimally impacted by volatility. He may have gained or lost a few dollars during the whole course but he could gain or he could lose. It would average out vs. sending the money via a moneygram or wire transfer where he is guaranteed to spend a lot of money for each transaction ($50 at my bank to send an international wire transfer). But many people today buy Bitcoin strictly as an investment vehicle (I'll admit I am hodling too but I don't jump on the bandwagon when the price starts going up and panic when it starts going down either). Their speculation WILL and HAS already caused bubbles in Bitcoin. Every time the bubble bursts it is a black eye for Bitcoin as a whole and the idiots say, \"I told you so\". Hopefully someday Bitcoin will find its value and hold a somewhat stable price causing people to stop wanting to invest in it so much. But people will ALWAYS speculate with Bitcoin, unfortunately.\nThreat to current money businesses\n- I believe Bitcoin is already at war with the central banks and other money businesses, such as credit card companies, payment processors, the IRS, etc. They perceive it as a threat to their business and they pull a ton of power in goverments around the world. They will try to use propaganda and laws to prevent its widestream acceptance.\n", "author": "keelba Member Offline Activity: 104 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2015-01-16 20:30:36", "content": "people that it have money ... are old.\nthey prefer\nGOLD\nover bitcoin.\nwait a new generation for this.\n", "author": "Meuh6879 Legendary Offline Activity: 1512 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-01-16 20:31:39", "content": "Public perception of bitcoin is a significant issue too, but I guess it's human nature to form opinions about something you know nothing about\n", "author": "rexxarofmoknathal Sr. Member Offline Activity: 403 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-01-18 13:09:17", "content": "transaction times.\n", "author": "becker Full Member Offline Activity: 146 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-01-18 13:13:23", "content": "All other issues can be overcome except incentive.

Plus you've got neighbours each claiming the whole of the field that goes across borders.\nTherefore it's plausible that Canada has largest real proven reserves in the world. Unproven and speculative arctic reserves have huge potential also. Add in that they are among the top natural gas producers, top hydro-electricity producers, top nuclear power producers, and have significant coal reserves and wind energy projects, and the prospect of losing an \"energy war\" to even a united middle east becomes somewhat remote.\nAnd yeah, all the middle east countries working together?\nDon't forget also that that oil is all they've got, basically no other significant natural resources, no forests, no rolling prairies full of wheat, no thousands of freshwater lakes, no uranium deposits, limited minerals and metals....\nBasically their current policy is enough like an all or nothing game of chicken for them, I doubt they will take any increased risk.\nPersonally I think they are a day late and a dollar short on this price dump, for a start, with the development of tar sands and shale oil etc, they no longer hold the trump, they're just a large fraction, rather than a majority. Now, they can kill production on those fields in the race to the bottom, their oil is cheaper to get out of the ground. But, too late, infrastructure is there, it will just get mothballed, we'll just freaking buy up  every last barrel, and given their \"extremely optimistic\" proved reserve numbers, those last barrels will be coming out sooner than they think. Then what, western companies will pour billions into developing marginal resources in middle east? Don't think so, not any more.

I really doubt the Saudis are that dumb as they can't do it for very long and they're just selling oil for a discount(not very economically feasible). I would suspect there have been some backroom deals with the USA and Saudi Arabia, potentially involving ISIS and Russia. Can't anyone remember in April when the US started selling reserves to bring down the price of oil. I think it went from around $105 to $80 in about a month. They specifically said this was a warning shot to Russia over Crimea.

However, it only produces about 30 million barrels of oil per day (since not all the oil in the ground is taken out at once).\nA single barrel of oil can be harnessed to produce about 1.7 megawatts of electricity. Therefore, 30 million barrels of oil is equal to about 51 terawatts.\nA current state-of-the-art miner such as the Antminer S5 uses just 0.51 watts per GH/s. If the Middle East decided to shut down oil exports and consumption for one day and instead dedicated it all towards attacking Bitcoin, 51 terawatts of electricity would be enough to supply a total hashrate of exactly 100 billion terahashes. The current hashrate of the Bitcoin network is roughly about 300,000 terahashes. This would give the Middle East about 99.9997 percent of the total hashrate of the entire network.\nYou can also do the same calculations for other countries and groups of countries too. See how much electricity they consume and then imagine if they dedicated all of that towards attacking Bitcoin. OK, so maybe not all of the electricity used in one day would be used to attack Bitcoin in a hypothetical attack scenario but even if a medium sized nation decided to dedicate only 10 percent of its typical per-day electrical consumption towards performing an attack, the results are still pretty terrifying.\nit could be.

(just realized that I'll need to wear those socks) An example of the suit is pictured below. I'm thinking more casual than formal. As far as the bola, I'm considered hand tooled leather that Martin could do. Of course I'll have a Bitcoin themed leather wallet.\nI would rather not include many Bitcoin only related companies, but would consider it provided ad space was paid for. It wouldn't be much, but would at least cover the cost of the embroidery.\nhttp://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Morgan+Spurlock+Buys+Rights+Name+Altoona+PA+Hkj2tnty13Zl.jpg\n", "author": "ulatec Newbie Offline Activity: 17 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-01-11 10:40:30", "content": "cool, hopefully its a fair show!\n", "author": "LiteCoinGuy Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1001 In Satoshi I Trust "}, {"date": "2015-01-18 05:00:02", "content": "Think it's on Thurs night can't wait.\n", "author": "Ghepetto Sr. Member Offline Activity: 249 Merit: 250 "}], "date": "2015-01-11 04:59:02"}, {"content": "Mike Maloney is bullish on Bitcoin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j_J0lbXkcA\nwatch also:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyV0OfU3-FU\ngreat news in my opinion\n", "views": 685, "author": "LiteCoinGuy Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1001 In Satoshi I Trust ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMike Maloney is bullish on Bitcoin :-) !\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-01-17 21:04:06", "content": "thanks\nenjoyed\nI like Mike Maloney a lot\n", "author": "Guido Legendary Offline Activity: 1053 Merit: 1001 "}, {"date": "2015-01-17 21:35:33", "content": "thanks\nenjoyed\nI like Mike Maloney a lot\nGuess you bought silver at 40 eh?\n", "author": "TheDreadPirateDickstein Member Offline Activity: 168 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2015-01-17 21:53:09", "content": "over month, quality of videos decrease ... from malloney.\nhave you problem with bank blacklisted client ?\n", "author": "Meuh6879 Legendary Offline Activity: 1512 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-01-18 03:20:15", "content": "I also checked Mike Maloney's vids.\nIt must be a tough time for him recently, for US dollar being strong and gold mostly decline in price.\n", "author": "nextblast Hero Member Offline Activity: 672 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-01-18 03:27:47", "content": "I also checked Mike Maloney's vids.\nIt must be a tough time for him recently, for US dollar being strong and gold mostly decline in price.\nUSD strong is not a good sign.

We don't have this information, we know only that he was chatting with DPR. To be admin for a web like this is not easy to be accepted. Or maybe that \"admin\" is the creator of the SK.\n- If that agent has access to see the location of DPR just chatting, why they didn't localize also all the clients that used SK to sell/buy drogs. So all those users are not prosecuted...

Maybe 10% of the countries in the world have managed to achieve something like this 10% of the time. In many cases it has appeared to be achieved but been proven a fragile illusion. In the current global financial climate, no country has natural immunity. Truly it is unstoppable, it is inevitable. The only question is, how long the patients fight it, and whether they will then surrender and enter symbiosis sooner rather than later. In that regard it's a virus that's more like gut bacteria, in the end it strengthens the host. However in the process of becoming infected, the patients might try ridiculous extreme measures, like blood letting, burning their hair, drinking mercury, one hundred kinds of quackery that may either bring their demise, hasten colonisation of the virus, or just bring pain and suffering unnecessarily.\nLike the flu, it will have high mutagenic potential, this years flu vaccine will be ineffective against next years strain, bitcoin is in the wild, the wilderness tests it, shapes it, makes it stronger. Bitcoin is as great an innovation as the printing press. Governments and tyrants have sought to control printing and mass dissemination of information, this has proved impossible, we came out of the dark ages, into the age of enlightenment. We are the vanguard of a new age upon this earth, the tide of history rises behind us.\n", "author": "Flashman Hero Member Offline Activity: 518 Merit: 500 Hodl!

What you're advocating isn't freedom, it's suppression. If you've ever taken drugs(Highly addictive ones i.e crystal meth etc) before or know someone who has, then you'd know that those things don't give people freedom, it takes it away.\nYou, grendel25, is the perfect example of why we need centralization in matters like this. What Ross did was wrong and also right in some respects. He brought the drug exchange to the internet in a simple way, which probably helped curb the violence usually seen in drug trades on the streets. But, he also made drugs more easily accessible to people, especially minors.\nIt's in my honest opinion, that I believe online drug markets should be allowed, with the exception that the exchange of child pornography be completely and wholly banned and that anyone buying drugs be over the age of 21, and the markets should be overseen and monitored by the \"feds\". The site administrators and staff(as well as the vendors) should be on the lookout for minors trying to get drugs and report them, and definitely on the lookout for the exchange of child pornography. Such exchanges might help stop the violence seen with drug trades IRL, along with making things like this a lot safer and more democratic.\n**Of course if the site administrators don't listen and abide by those rules, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law**\n", "author": "darkota Hero Member Online Activity: 714 Merit: 500 ONe Social Network "}, {"date": "2015-01-18 02:23:57", "content": "[quote athor=DarthCoinX link=topic=927750.msg10185804#msg10185804 date=1421501417]\nhttp://imgur.com/07VStSK\nAnd something to read more about:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2smm94/silk_road_case_just_another_fakery/\nAlso the post was deleted after few minutes:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2sqacm/this_reddit_sub_is_censoring_posts/\n[/quote]Anybody can show this shit face.\n", "author": "Agestorzrxx Sr. Member Offline Activity: 462 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-01-18 02:29:02", "content": "http://imgur.com/07VStSK\nAnd something to read more about:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2smm94/silk_road_case_just_another_fakery/\nAlso the post was deleted after few minutes:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2sqacm/this_reddit_sub_is_censoring_posts/\nOne flaw in it, as far as price goes drugs give bitcoin a baseline value.

Therefore, it is correct to assume that\nif\nthe device is compromised, you could lose the BTC stored on it.\nCan the device be compromised? For instance, can the attacker convince it to run software supplied by the attacker?\nFrom time to time, the firmware on the device has to be updated. The update is downloaded from the site of the producer and signed with several (3? Don't recall any more) secret keys of the developers. The signatures are checked with the public keys of the developers, which are stored in the firmware of the device. Can this process be subverted?\nIf the PC downloading the new firmware is compromised, the malware on it can modify the new firmware - but it would invalidate the signatures. Therefore, a different approach is needed.\nOne possibility is if the signing (secret) keys of the developers are compromised - either by a disgruntled employee, or because they go rogue, or because the company is hacked. Such things have happened in the past. However,\nseveral\nkeys would have to be compromised (and the breach not noticed); just one would not be enough. While not impossible, I consider this highly unlikely.\nThere is another approach, however - one that exploits not cryptography but human nature. We call is \"social engineering\" but it's basically lying and manipulation. Suppose that the malware on the compromised PC intercepts all communications to and from the company server and changes the firmware update page. It puts a HUGE warning that the company's keys have been compromised, there are new ones and the new firmware is signed with them, so trust us and ignore any warnings from the device - with screen shots of what to do and everything. (The same thing can be achieved by hacking the company's site - but that would be noticed and fixed fast enough.)\nWhile many people will realize that something is fishy, many more would not.

It would be nice to see some docs about how to do this.\nThe biggest part of the problem was becoming familiar with compiling software and installing it on the operating systems that were involved:  Ubuntu 14.04 and Windows 7.  Initially, I just focused on Ubuntu.  I started out running it in a VMware virtual machine (free version) that ran under Window 7, but this was interfering with the performance of other things I use the machine for, so I spend $300 and put together an Atom based Intel NUC system with 120 GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM.  I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on this machine.  Initially I was using a spare keyboard and mouse and VGA display, but after I got the system running OK and set up SSH I have managed the system headless using PUTTY from my Windows 7 machine.\nI went to the Electrum web site and then to Github and found the instructions for installing Electrum Server, which involve building it from source. This was pretty straightforward, just involved tracing down some dependencies.  I am no Linux expert, so a certain amount of Googling was needed to interpret error messages and figure out how to do things, such as increasing the number of open files.  The first part of the directions was to build a bitcoin node from source on this machine.  After I got this working, and installed on the system and it seemed to be working OK, I moved on to the electrum server and got it to work with electrum clients on one of my other machines (the release version, not the Trezor version. At this point I was running a couple of PUTTY terminal windows.  The last thing to do on this box was to rig it so that bitcoind and Electrum server started up automatically at boot. The machine runs unattended and draws almost no power (less than 15 watts) and sits behind a  UPS, so it does not glitch with my frequent power interruptions.  The Electrum Server is not very robust and if the system is shut down without waiting for the Electrum server to finish processing, the database can be corrupted and this can take hours to recover, so don't do this.\nThe next step was to get an Electrum 2.0 client running.  I did this first under an Ubuntu virtual machine on my Windows system. The directions are at the Electrum git-hub site. Again, some tracing down dependencies and loading them with apt-get.  At this point the next step was to get the Trezor running.  This requires installation of appropriate routines to allow Python programs to access the Trezor via the USB. This is the Python Trezor code, also available from Github. It includes a \"hello world\" test program to verify that a Python program can talk to the Trezor.  I ran into one obscure problem getting this to work. I had to find the utility to see what was going on on the (virtual) USB, bypassing the \"Cython\" wrapper that connected Python to the C code that talked to the USB. I thought something was seriously broken, but then I discovered that everything worked fine so long as I was running as root.  Once I set up the USB protections so the account used for the my normal login was permitted to access the Trezor (both read and write) then everything was fine.  At this point it was just a matter of starting with no wallets in the .electrum directory and Electrum 2.0 prompted me for the rest and my Trezor based wallet showed up.\nI ran this way for a month.  Eventually, I got bored and curious and figured out how to get Electrum 2.0 to run under Windows 7.  This involved installing Python, Python-Qt and a development environment for C code.  This was another learning experience on my part, but it was all possible by downloading free software.  I got waylaid for a few hours until I realized that the free C compiler I had used was only 32 bits, and so I had to redownload and reinstall the appropriate versions of Python and Python-Qt.\nFor someone with more skill that I had, all of this would be an easy process.  The longest time required was the time for the initial download and block sync of bitcoind and the downloading of the electrum server database and initial sync of the electrum server.   If all you want to do is use Trezor via Electrum, none of this server work is needed, but then you will have to trust the electrum servers, which means you had better not be paranoid.\nI deliberately picked a low end Intel Nuc (1.4 GHz single core) for a server machine  to see if it would be fast enough. It takes less than 10 percent of CPU time for bitcoind to keep up with the network, even where 1 MB blocks are back to back.  I can't say as much for the Electrum Server.  The CPU seems to be saturated and uses about 30-40 percent of the CPU on this slow machine for large blocks.  This seems unnecessary, as I understand it, but I don't know enough about Python to know how to profile the software and speed it up.  (I'm sure that this can be done, because running an Electrum Server doesn't involve verifying transactions in the block chain, which is the time consuming part of bitcoin processing.  The server is just doing database processing which ought to be lightening fast with 8 GB of RAM and an SSD.)\nI would not recommend doing this if you aren't already an expert or (as in my case) you \"enjoy\" learning experiences. :-)\nhttps://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-server\nhttps://github.com/spesmilo/electrum\nhttps://github.com//trezor/python-trezor\n", "author": "tl121 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 279 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 19:30:30", "content": "AFAIK, the Trezor has a hardware random device so the random numbers it produces should be good.  Just in case, it also adds random numbers from the computer on first initialization.\nBut if you really want to, you can enter your own seed generated from dice rolls.

If you go this way, you need to trust the computer where you compute the sequence.\nYou should never enter the 12/18/24 word sequence directly into a computer.  If you restore the Trezor from backup it will ask for the words in a random order (on its own display), so even if the javascript code or the local computer is compromised, it will not know the order of the words.  Of course, knowing which words occur in the sequence drastically reduces the security of the sequence.\nFirmware updates have to be sent manually to the trezor using a special procedure involving pressing both buttons while connecting the trezor to the computer.  So even if the firmware keys are compromised, an attacker has to convince you to make a firmware update.  So if you check the social networks for announcements before doing a firmware update you should be fine.  Another problem may be an unknown bug (0day exploit) in the current firmware.  Still an attacker needs to compromise first your computer or the mytrezor domain or the client you use to access the Trezor and second the Trezor firmware.\n", "author": "johoe Full Member Offline Activity: 217 Merit: 103 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 19:32:46", "content": "I will send Slush link to this thread, he may answer you...\n", "author": "sase007 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 364 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 19:40:09", "content": "I will send Slush link to this thread, he may answer you...\nIt has already been answered on the first page\n", "author": "SirChiko Legendary Offline Activity: 980 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 19:54:46", "content": "The private keys of your trezor never go out from it, and you can always check in its screen the transaction parameters to see if they are correct or not.\nI have not seen yet any trezor hack.\nBoy wouldn't it suck to find out one day that the Trezor devices were simply using wifi to transmit the information on them?\nThere are so many suspicious infommerical-sounding posts for the Trezor all over the internet right now, I really wonder how many are legit.\nIn my opinion, you have to be a complete idiot to trust your money to any electronic device, provided by any 3rd party, for any reason whatsoever right now.\nPaper wallets all the way.\n-B-\n", "author": "BittBurger Hero Member Offline Activity: 868 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 19:59:14", "content": "Trezor is one of the most secures ways to have your bitcoins stored.\nI don't agree, paper wallet or offline computer wallet is more secure and free\nA paper backup is a quite safe method to protect bitcoins, but you still need to load private keys from paper using a trusted computer to send your coins to somebody else - please see the docs -\nhttp://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-faq/differences.html\n", "author": "kamilosa Member Offline Activity: 61 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2015-01-12 20:08:56", "content": "The private keys of your trezor never go out from it, and you can always check in its screen the transaction parameters to see if they are correct or not.\nI have not seen yet any trezor hack.\nBoy wouldn't it suck to find out one day that the Trezor devices were simply using wifi to transmit the information on them?\nThere are so many suspicious infommerical-sounding posts for the Trezor all over the internet right now, I really wonder how many are legit.\nIn my opinion, you have to be a complete idiot to trust your money to any electronic device, provided by any 3rd party, for any reason whatsoever right now.\nPaper wallets all the way.\n-B-\nPlease read the docs first\nhttp://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/securityphilosophy.html\n.

On January 13th, one who may have done just that went on trial in federal court in Manhattan, accused of drug-trafficking, money-laundering and operating a criminal enterprise. Ross Ulbricht, a 30-year-old Texan physics graduate, is accused of being Dread Pirate Roberts, the founder and administrator of the Silk Road. This was the first website to make it possible to buy and sell illegal drugs online openly and with relative anonymity. His trial will raise questions not only about the extent and nature of cybercrime, but also about the limits of government snooping necessary to prevent it.\nThe Silk Road was shut down by the FBI at the end of 2013. It worked by combining two new technologies: Tor, which allows people to host websites without revealing where they are based, and bitcoin, a decentralised online currency which offers a close digital alternative to a bag of unmarked banknotes. On the site, buyers and sellers could trade with remarkable discretion. Over two years, deals generated 9.5m bitcoin in sales (worth $1.8 billion today, though the exchange rate has fluctuated wildly) and over 600,000 bitcoin in commission. That is enough booty to make Blackbeard throw away his cutlass and pick up a mouse.\nThe prosecution has already produced evidence that Mr Ulbricht was Dread Pirate Roberts. They argue that he left a digital trail, administering the Silk Road through unencrypted connections and using his personal e-mail address to look for technical help. More sensationally, they allege that he not only set up the site, but sought to defend it violently. As the Dread Pirate, Mr Ulbricht is accused of paying for the assassinations of several people who threatened the site, including one former employee. None of these murders seems to have happened, but they prevented Mr Ulbricht from being granted bail after his arrest in 2013.\nMr Ulbricht says he was framed: the real Dread Pirates remain at large. His lawyers also claim that the FBI may have used illegal methods to identify and seize the Icelandic server on which the Silk Road was hosted, and from which much of the evidence comes. The FBI says the site contained a vulnerability which revealed where it really was, despite Tor. But several technical specialists think this implausible. Sadly for Mr Ulbricht, it may not matter much. In a ruling in October, a judge concluded that since he has not admitted any legal interest in the Silk Road server, he is unable to claim under the Fourth Amendment that it was illegally searched, and so the evidence from the server is admissible however it was found. This, the judge admitted, might appear to place Ulbricht in a catch-22. If he admits to an interest in the server, he would weaken his defence at his trial; if he doesnt, he has no chance of getting the evidence against him dismissed.\nMr Ulbrichts defence, which has been generously funded by online donations, is thus likely to focus on the strength of the evidence linking him to the online activities of Dread Pirate Roberts. Nonetheless, cyber-criminalsas well as other users of the dark webwill be watching closely. Since the Silk Road was taken offline, several similar market-places have been started, and many closed by the authorities.
