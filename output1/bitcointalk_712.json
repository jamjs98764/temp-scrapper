The exported inflation by QE has officially ended, as a result, a world wide deflation is on going, and the people in USA is the beneficiary since they received the money at the first place\nAnd FED is going to raise the rate later this year, further tightening the USD supply. However, many banks have received enough cash for future 30 years, so the rate is not a big deal for banks\nThis is a big opportunity for bitcoin: When FED tightens, could bitcoin take over? As proved by history, when FED tightens, everything's price will go down, due to people are desperately dependent on USD supply to live. But now they have the choice of using cryptocurrency to do the transaction, thus become FED independent, but how to make that transition happen is the question\nIt seems quite difficult, because fiat money is pushed into everyone in form of new loan and salary, as long as the income or financing arrives in the form of fiat money, people will use it without second thought. However bitcoin comes neither in forms of loan nor salary, people must actively acquire bitcoin before they can spend it, and they need a strong motivation to do that\n", "author": "johnyj Legendary Offline Activity: 1848 Merit: 1000 Beyond Imagination "}], "date": "2015-03-20 09:06:46"}, {"content": "It is usually argued that the hash of the latest block is not a good source of randomness because miners can manipulate that outcome.\nI was thinking in the case of Euromillions if it would seem secure enough to use the hash of the hashes of latest 1000 blocks.\nTo further make it more difficult to manipulate all hashes to be hashed would be ordered according to their position in terms natural counting ordering, that is, the lowest hash would come first in the concatenation.\nFurther, each hash would be hashed with its Unix timestamp, before entering the special order concatenation.\nI think this would be an ultra safe extraction for a game like euromillions.\nWhat do you think?

Intel is advertising for a cryptographic researcher position to work on the ledger side of the tech.\nThe blockchain is the distribution ledger that records a bitcoin transaction over the exchange network, which runs the bitcoin software. The blockchain allows for money to be transferred using the blockchain technology, which cuts out the middle man (like a bank) when getting the funds transferred  cutting down on the time and money it costs to send that money from one network to another.\nAccording to Intels job post, here is what Intel has to say about monetizing the bitcoin technology: Digital currencies like Bitcoin have captured the imagination of the press. Related startups are generating a great deal of VC interest and investment because of the potential significance of any disruption of the financial payment industry.\nThe job would be with Intel Labs Special Innovation Projects group and would involve investigating hardware and software capabilities that advance the performance, robustness, and scalability of open, decentralized ledgers. The post even goes on to explain how the blockchain tech works, including the benefits of using it on digital marketplaces.\nIts fundamental technical innovation is the decentralized transaction ledger called the block-chain. It allows bitcoin to prevent double-spending of currency by recording all transactions in an open ledger without the need for a central authority. Such a distributed, public, secure, peer-to-peer transaction record enables not just the exchange of bitcoins but many secondary uses that the research and startup community are exploring such as digital marketplaces.\nCan't wait until Blockchain tech in almost every computing device...sh#t's gonna get real, real soon!\n", "views": 1142, "author": "ChuckBuck Hero Member Offline Activity: 840 Merit: 510 Vietnamese translator - https://goo.gl/Muc9xi ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCore i7's and Blockchains together, now you know you in trouble!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-03-19 15:09:53", "content": "I can see this being apparant in majority of our machines that we use everyday.
