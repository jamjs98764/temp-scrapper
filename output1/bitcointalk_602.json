Centralization is indeed a problem, albeit nobody has a real solution for this.

Maybe it is not a concern right now but it will be soon. Don't think Satoshi imagined that mining will become like this. But I don't think there is a solution to this now.\nWhat if there was a way to make bitcoin's code aware of mining data such as in this pie chart..\nAnd then vary difficulty based on who is connected and how much hash they are putting on to where connections of lesser hash would be hashing on a smaller difficulty then the mega hash connections. Like assign the greatest hash difficulty + 10% and the smallest hash difficulty -10%. To where if say actual difficulty was \"find a hash with value less than 10\" assign the greatest hash connection \"must be less than 9\" and the least hash connection \"must be less than 11\" and assign every hashing connection in the middle between least and greatest a difficulty somewhere in the middle..\nhash=100=less than 9\nhash=75=less than 9.5\nhash=50=less than 10\nhash=25 less than 10.5\nhash=1= less than 11\nWhere hash=100 is the greatest hash connection and hash=1 is the least hashing connection.\nThis could be done linearly or exponentially or variably based on the difference between the least and greatest hashing connection and the solved block would be accepted based on difficulty X (connection hash % of max/min) and could even be weighted based on the % of miners that fall into a certin ange between least and greatest. Give an advantage of lower difficulty to connections with less hash power to bust up the mining monopolies.\nOfcourse I have no idea if something like this is possible because I really don't know what I'm talking about but I think it would be good to find a way to put the mining monopolies at a disadvantage VS the more decentralized miners.\nI also think that this must not be done with rules or laws but rather in a way that provides incentives based on the code so the free market will sort it out.\nTook me a while to find this post again..\nSomeone who could very well be Satoshi\nsaid\n:\nI have been following the recent block size debates through the mailing list.  I had hoped the debate would resolve and that a fork proposal would achieve widespread consensus.  However with the formal release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A, this looks unlikely to happen, and so I am forced to share my concerns about this very dangerous fork.\nThe developers of this pretender-Bitcoin claim to be following my original vision, but nothing could be further from the truth.  When I designed Bitcoin, I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement.  Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it.  By doing a fork in this way, these developers are violating the \"original vision\" they claim to honour.\nThey use my old writings to make claims about what Bitcoin was supposed to be.  However I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time, and new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early opinions.\nFor example I didn't anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network.  Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution.  I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.\nIf two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what \"Bitcoin\" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project.  Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust.  This present situation has been very disappointing to watch unfold.\nI like that post a lot and think it is something that should really be thought about.\nI don't know. I wish I was a genius and understood all the code but I don't.

(try not to pick a national chain but local stores*)\n3. group together some useful links that prove bitcoins legitimacy, eg video's that dont mention silkroad but show US/canadian/european senates/committee's discussing bitcoin. links to IRS that show they recognise bitcoin. and even intro video's of how to set up bitpay/coinbase accounts.\n4. approach the store individually and ask the shop workers at different times if they accept bitcoin. expect them to say no, but ask them if they can find out from their manager if or when they might..\n5. give it a bit of time for everyone in your area to have popped the question to the store at different times (so it doesnt seem like a flashmob advertising campaign). that way the manager see's there might be a true demand for it.\n6. if you get to talk to the manager direct or if later finding contact details. hand them the link to all the info you think they will need to get their questions asked and try setting up a bitpay/coinbase account\n*point 2 is because local managers of national chains dont have decision making powers, so try out independant shops first\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Offline Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2016-02-07 23:52:01", "content": "To be honest i agree.

That helps a potential future ally and gives the \"sharing economy\" more of what it needs to thrive, and you get the benefit of a chance to tell an Uber driver about this cool new way to accept payments for his \"ride sharing\" side gig.\n", "views": 280, "author": "commandrix Hero Member Offline Activity: 798 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf we want governments off our backs, we need to quit being so hyperfocused.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-02-07 17:38:53", "content": "As you said using decentralised services is the way to go,  most off the ones you mention i already use.\n", "author": "calkob Hero Member Offline Activity: 714 Merit: 500 "}], "date": "2016-02-07 17:29:55"}, {"content": "https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492972/gs-16-1-distributed-ledger-technology.pdf\n\"Algorithms that enable the creation of distributed ledgers are powerful, disruptive\ninnovations that could transform the delivery of public and private services and\nenhance productivity through a wide range of applications.\nLedgers have been at the heart of commerce since ancient times and are used to\nrecord many things, most commonly assets such as money and property. They\nhave moved from being recorded on clay tablets to papyrus, vellum and paper.\nHowever, in all this time the only notable innovation has been computerisation,\nwhich initially was simply a transfer from paper to bytes. Now, for the first time\nalgorithms enable the collaborative creation of digital distributed ledgers with\nproperties and capabilities that go far beyond traditional paper-based ledgers.\nA distributed ledger is essentially an asset database that can be shared across\na network of multiple sites, geographies or institutions. All participants within\na network can have their own identical copy of the ledger. Any changes to the\nledger are reflected in all copies in minutes, or in some cases, seconds. The\nassets can be financial, legal, physical or electronic. The security and accuracy\nof the assets stored in the ledger are maintained cryptographically through the\nuse of keys and signatures to control who can do what within the shared ledger.\nEntries can also be updated by one, some or all of the participants, according to\nrules agreed by the network.\nUnderlying this technology is the block chain, which was invented to create\nthe peer-to-peer digital cash Bitcoin in 2008. Block chain algorithms enable\nBitcoin transactions to be aggregated in blocks and these are added to a\nchain of existing blocks using a cryptographic signature. The Bitcoin ledger is\nconstructed in a distributed and permissionless fashion, so that anyone can\nadd a block of transactions if they can solve a new cryptographic puzzle to add\neach new block. The incentive for doing this is that there is currently a reward\nin the form of twenty five Bitcoins awarded to the solver of the puzzle for each\nblock. Anyone with access to the internet and the computing power to solve\nthe cryptographic puzzles can add to the ledger and they are known as Bitcoin\nminers. The mining analogy is apt because the process of mining Bitcoin is\nenergy intensive as it requires very large computing power. It has been estimated\nthat the energy requirements to run Bitcoin are in excess of 1GW and may be\ncomparable to the electricity usage of Ireland.\"\n", "views": 335, "author": "jyakulis Sr. Member Offline Activity: 467 Merit: 250 Resident Retard ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK.gov paper on blockchain and distributed ledgers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-02-07 16:26:13", "content": "Ooo page 55 they compare it to the industrial revolution amongst other advances.\n\"Previous technological revolutions had little or no impact on pyramidal,\nhierarchical systems of organisation and governance.

Once the block sizes increase (which wont happen until January 2016, and then only if 75% of the miners have switched to Bitcoin XT), the two versions of bitcoin will be incompatible.

For bitcoin's entire existence there has always been the very real possibility that disagreements, bugs, and other events could result in a huge loss (or simply a lack of growth, which is an opportunity loss) of whatever value you stored in it.  Those that are willing to take that risk are rewarded with significantly higher exchange rates in the future if it succeeds and continues to grow.\nBitcoin is an experimental concept and you should never hold so much value in bitcoin that you would be devastated to lose it.  Instead, if you have some extra cash laying around that you won't mind losing, and you want to take a chance that bitcoin will continue to succeed, you could hold that value as bitcoins.\nPersonally, I feel that the quotes that you posted are alarmist, misleading, exaggerations, and not entirely accurate.\nIf you hold some bitcoins now, and a few years from now this whole blocksize debate is settled without any disasters, how high do you suppose the exchange rate will be when the public has much more faith in bitcoin's long term potential?\nFortunately, bitcoin is a consensus based system.  It is impossible to change it without the consensus of the users.  So, its rather unlikely that the users will continue to accept a disastrous decision over the long term.  Eventually users will either abandon the system (which will make it easier for the remaining users to improve it since there are less users that need to consent), or users will agree on improvements to the system.  You'll notice that in either of those two scenarios, the system is eventually improved.\n", "author": "DannyHamilton Legendary Offline Activity: 2198 Merit: 1371 "}, {"date": "2016-02-06 18:25:29", "content": "it will not split anything, it will simply create a legit chain and a uselesses one that will eventually die, because it has not enough consensus, and will become the altcoin, the other will be again the bitcoin chain we all know\nso there is no two chain ever, as a many believe, that is simply wrong on so many level it's not even funny anymore\nAmph is right.

Then those two Governments probably had fear to release publicly their project and its product (bitcoin and blockchain) and asked the help of Satoshi Nakamoto promising to him the first 1 million produced bitcoin. But with one condition. Satoshi must disappear after a while and after the having its part of bitcoin. Then The US Government (in accordance with UK Government) will order Fed to study their work in order to learn about what is talking about and to see the possibility to apply that technology when and where FED will think is more profitable for FED and the US Government.\nFinally the big secret is known.

Come on, I mean you've got Merkel Trees (a linux technology), Poisson distribution, networking, public/private encryption, TOR, a recipe in the whitepaper that implies the idea has been tried and tested in depth on a private network. The way the paper is written is EXTREMELY professional. I have read quite a few whitepapers and this is more professional than many I have read which have multiple authors (and this is supposedly just 1 individual). This is 100% not an individual writing this but a team of people.\nsatoshi pseudonym was used by 1 individual.. but that individual didnt invent everything from scratch. many coders are known to use existing resources and include elements from other sources.\nsatoshi was talking to many people, cypherfunks, sourceforge, IRC, even this forum was developed so that he could collaborate with others.\nno denying that,\nbut it was satoshi, a single entity/person that put all the puzzle pieces of other peoples work together into one seamless and working project. even the white paper credits multiple people on the last page.. so yes, its true he didnt make every technology from scratch, many coders use functions that already exist.. but it was satoshi that pieced it together and utilised other peoples ideas in ways no one else thought of\n* The thing just freakin works as soon as it is released with no problems. This is very suspect and unusual. Anyone who ever did programming knows that nothing works like that unless it has been EXTENSIVELY tested for months and months (if not years). That requires a lot of skill and resources, more than any individual has.\nthey were testing it for months. infact on day one, satoshi (again only one person using the pseudonym) had people like hal finney, |)ruid and others all working together and debugging it as they went on. if you compare the very very first release of bitcoin in january 2009 to lets say the release in december 2009, the code is very different. because there were bugs. and by the time of december 2009 there were dozens of people working with bitcoin, debugging and adding new code/features.\neven in 2016 its not perfect, many people say that satoshi could/should have gone in a different direction or included different code libraries.. so satoshi was not god.\nhe was though the single inventer that made the puzzle complete. utilising other peoples puzzle pieces and then open sourcing his puzzle to debug it\n* The paper was released at the beginning of the year (suspicious.... implies it was professionally scheduled)\nit was released late part of 2008 actually, but oh well\nLets also remember at this point that most of the protocols behind the internet were invented by the US government. It's a no brainer.\nBasically this is a 100% US government project (I think US &amp; UK, given the mix of spellings). It is 100% a team that worked on it and it was an idea that was worked on for years until it was released.\nnah, the spelling is due to the racist nature of web browsers thinking that america dominates the world and makes people spell american style purely by having that irritating red line underneath british spellings. where as adobe and microsoft word (offline writing tools) are less racist and let UK folk write how we want without much irritation. so i can easily see why the PDF looks more british than online posts\nas for the technology being american government.. well actually TCP/IP, HTML, Java, C++ was an international effort. but highly adopted later by america, and then the whole world had to pander to the american way.\nso assuming he must be american purely because he used the internet and c++.. shows you might not be thinking out side of the box..\n50 years in the future we will know when the files come out. Until then everything else in the media is a false flag. That's another reason why satoshi is so effective at keeping\nhis\nsilence and will never return.

Also it is no coincidence the marshalls coins went to one of the most established and trusted American VCs.\nso after that long amount of assumptions.. even your subconcious mind truly thinks satoshi was a single person.. by you saying \"his silence\" instead of \"their silence\".\nim safe to assume you have yet to truly convince yourself that satoshi wasnt just one entity. whether you realise it or not\nall in all i dont think satoshi was a god.\nand here is an analogy.\nmany many many years ago, people realised they could turn wheat into flour\nmany many many years ago, people realised eggs could be eaten by humans\nmany many many years ago, people realised cows milk was not just for calves\nmany many many years ago, people realised putting these things together made dough\nmany many many years ago, people realised sugar tasted nice and sweet\nmany many many years ago, people realised food colourings added nice aesthetics to otherwise bland looking food.\nbut it was only one person that made the very first fully decorated colourful icing cake. by  putting it all together\nand then within hours others helped by making it better tweaking the ingredients colours, amount of icing, adding a bit of chocolate to improve flavouring.\n(basically debugging it as the cake wasnt perfect)\n(not important side note: while writing this i have irritating red lines for colour and flavour, but i didnt edit them to make a point)\niced cakes today are not the exact same recipe as that very first invention.. and is it really important that the first cake chef is discovered and praised as a god? or do we just eat our cake and be happy\nI enjoyed reading your Legendary post.\n\"We've been Franked!\"\nmany many many years ago, people realised they could turn wheat into flour\nThe people who\n\"basically debugged\"\nthe flour forgot to consider/test what a gluten-filled diet would eventually do to humans.\n", "author": "Bit_Happy Legendary Offline Activity: 1778 Merit: 1004 A Great Time to Start Something!

Centralization is indeed a problem, albeit nobody has a real solution for this.

Maybe it is not a concern right now but it will be soon. Don't think Satoshi imagined that mining will become like this. But I don't think there is a solution to this now.\nWhat if there was a way to make bitcoin's code aware of mining data such as in this pie chart..\nAnd then vary difficulty based on who is connected and how much hash they are putting on to where connections of lesser hash would be hashing on a smaller difficulty then the mega hash connections. Like assign the greatest hash difficulty + 10% and the smallest hash difficulty -10%. To where if say actual difficulty was \"find a hash with value less than 10\" assign the greatest hash connection \"must be less than 9\" and the least hash connection \"must be less than 11\" and assign every hashing connection in the middle between least and greatest a difficulty somewhere in the middle..\nhash=100=less than 9\nhash=75=less than 9.5\nhash=50=less than 10\nhash=25 less than 10.5\nhash=1= less than 11\nWhere hash=100 is the greatest hash connection and hash=1 is the least hashing connection.\nThis could be done linearly or exponentially or variably based on the difference between the least and greatest hashing connection and the solved block would be accepted based on difficulty X (connection hash % of max/min) and could even be weighted based on the % of miners that fall into a certin ange between least and greatest. Give an advantage of lower difficulty to connections with less hash power to bust up the mining monopolies.\nOfcourse I have no idea if something like this is possible because I really don't know what I'm talking about but I think it would be good to find a way to put the mining monopolies at a disadvantage VS the more decentralized miners.\nI also think that this must not be done with rules or laws but rather in a way that provides incentives based on the code so the free market will sort it out.\nTook me a while to find this post again..\nSomeone who could very well be Satoshi\nsaid\n:\nI have been following the recent block size debates through the mailing list.  I had hoped the debate would resolve and that a fork proposal would achieve widespread consensus.  However with the formal release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A, this looks unlikely to happen, and so I am forced to share my concerns about this very dangerous fork.\nThe developers of this pretender-Bitcoin claim to be following my original vision, but nothing could be further from the truth.  When I designed Bitcoin, I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement.  Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it.  By doing a fork in this way, these developers are violating the \"original vision\" they claim to honour.\nThey use my old writings to make claims about what Bitcoin was supposed to be.  However I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time, and new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early opinions.\nFor example I didn't anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network.  Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution.  I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.\nIf two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what \"Bitcoin\" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project.  Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust.  This present situation has been very disappointing to watch unfold.\nI like that post a lot and think it is something that should really be thought about.\nI don't know. I wish I was a genius and understood all the code but I don't.

(try not to pick a national chain but local stores*)\n3. group together some useful links that prove bitcoins legitimacy, eg video's that dont mention silkroad but show US/canadian/european senates/committee's discussing bitcoin. links to IRS that show they recognise bitcoin. and even intro video's of how to set up bitpay/coinbase accounts.\n4. approach the store individually and ask the shop workers at different times if they accept bitcoin. expect them to say no, but ask them if they can find out from their manager if or when they might..\n5. give it a bit of time for everyone in your area to have popped the question to the store at different times (so it doesnt seem like a flashmob advertising campaign). that way the manager see's there might be a true demand for it.\n6. if you get to talk to the manager direct or if later finding contact details. hand them the link to all the info you think they will need to get their questions asked and try setting up a bitpay/coinbase account\n*point 2 is because local managers of national chains dont have decision making powers, so try out independant shops first\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Offline Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2016-02-07 23:52:01", "content": "To be honest i agree.

That helps a potential future ally and gives the \"sharing economy\" more of what it needs to thrive, and you get the benefit of a chance to tell an Uber driver about this cool new way to accept payments for his \"ride sharing\" side gig.\n", "views": 280, "author": "commandrix Hero Member Offline Activity: 798 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf we want governments off our backs, we need to quit being so hyperfocused.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-02-07 17:38:53", "content": "As you said using decentralised services is the way to go,  most off the ones you mention i already use.\n", "author": "calkob Hero Member Offline Activity: 714 Merit: 500 "}], "date": "2016-02-07 17:29:55"}, {"content": "https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492972/gs-16-1-distributed-ledger-technology.pdf\n\"Algorithms that enable the creation of distributed ledgers are powerful, disruptive\ninnovations that could transform the delivery of public and private services and\nenhance productivity through a wide range of applications.\nLedgers have been at the heart of commerce since ancient times and are used to\nrecord many things, most commonly assets such as money and property. They\nhave moved from being recorded on clay tablets to papyrus, vellum and paper.\nHowever, in all this time the only notable innovation has been computerisation,\nwhich initially was simply a transfer from paper to bytes. Now, for the first time\nalgorithms enable the collaborative creation of digital distributed ledgers with\nproperties and capabilities that go far beyond traditional paper-based ledgers.\nA distributed ledger is essentially an asset database that can be shared across\na network of multiple sites, geographies or institutions. All participants within\na network can have their own identical copy of the ledger. Any changes to the\nledger are reflected in all copies in minutes, or in some cases, seconds. The\nassets can be financial, legal, physical or electronic. The security and accuracy\nof the assets stored in the ledger are maintained cryptographically through the\nuse of keys and signatures to control who can do what within the shared ledger.\nEntries can also be updated by one, some or all of the participants, according to\nrules agreed by the network.\nUnderlying this technology is the block chain, which was invented to create\nthe peer-to-peer digital cash Bitcoin in 2008. Block chain algorithms enable\nBitcoin transactions to be aggregated in blocks and these are added to a\nchain of existing blocks using a cryptographic signature. The Bitcoin ledger is\nconstructed in a distributed and permissionless fashion, so that anyone can\nadd a block of transactions if they can solve a new cryptographic puzzle to add\neach new block. The incentive for doing this is that there is currently a reward\nin the form of twenty five Bitcoins awarded to the solver of the puzzle for each\nblock. Anyone with access to the internet and the computing power to solve\nthe cryptographic puzzles can add to the ledger and they are known as Bitcoin\nminers. The mining analogy is apt because the process of mining Bitcoin is\nenergy intensive as it requires very large computing power. It has been estimated\nthat the energy requirements to run Bitcoin are in excess of 1GW and may be\ncomparable to the electricity usage of Ireland.\"\n", "views": 335, "author": "jyakulis Sr. Member Offline Activity: 467 Merit: 250 Resident Retard ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUK.gov paper on blockchain and distributed ledgers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-02-07 16:26:13", "content": "Ooo page 55 they compare it to the industrial revolution amongst other advances.\n\"Previous technological revolutions had little or no impact on pyramidal,\nhierarchical systems of organisation and governance.

Once the block sizes increase (which wont happen until January 2016, and then only if 75% of the miners have switched to Bitcoin XT), the two versions of bitcoin will be incompatible.

For bitcoin's entire existence there has always been the very real possibility that disagreements, bugs, and other events could result in a huge loss (or simply a lack of growth, which is an opportunity loss) of whatever value you stored in it.  Those that are willing to take that risk are rewarded with significantly higher exchange rates in the future if it succeeds and continues to grow.\nBitcoin is an experimental concept and you should never hold so much value in bitcoin that you would be devastated to lose it.  Instead, if you have some extra cash laying around that you won't mind losing, and you want to take a chance that bitcoin will continue to succeed, you could hold that value as bitcoins.\nPersonally, I feel that the quotes that you posted are alarmist, misleading, exaggerations, and not entirely accurate.\nIf you hold some bitcoins now, and a few years from now this whole blocksize debate is settled without any disasters, how high do you suppose the exchange rate will be when the public has much more faith in bitcoin's long term potential?\nFortunately, bitcoin is a consensus based system.  It is impossible to change it without the consensus of the users.  So, its rather unlikely that the users will continue to accept a disastrous decision over the long term.  Eventually users will either abandon the system (which will make it easier for the remaining users to improve it since there are less users that need to consent), or users will agree on improvements to the system.  You'll notice that in either of those two scenarios, the system is eventually improved.\n", "author": "DannyHamilton Legendary Offline Activity: 2198 Merit: 1371 "}, {"date": "2016-02-06 18:25:29", "content": "it will not split anything, it will simply create a legit chain and a uselesses one that will eventually die, because it has not enough consensus, and will become the altcoin, the other will be again the bitcoin chain we all know\nso there is no two chain ever, as a many believe, that is simply wrong on so many level it's not even funny anymore\nAmph is right.

Then those two Governments probably had fear to release publicly their project and its product (bitcoin and blockchain) and asked the help of Satoshi Nakamoto promising to him the first 1 million produced bitcoin. But with one condition. Satoshi must disappear after a while and after the having its part of bitcoin. Then The US Government (in accordance with UK Government) will order Fed to study their work in order to learn about what is talking about and to see the possibility to apply that technology when and where FED will think is more profitable for FED and the US Government.\nFinally the big secret is known.

Come on, I mean you've got Merkel Trees (a linux technology), Poisson distribution, networking, public/private encryption, TOR, a recipe in the whitepaper that implies the idea has been tried and tested in depth on a private network. The way the paper is written is EXTREMELY professional. I have read quite a few whitepapers and this is more professional than many I have read which have multiple authors (and this is supposedly just 1 individual). This is 100% not an individual writing this but a team of people.\nsatoshi pseudonym was used by 1 individual.. but that individual didnt invent everything from scratch. many coders are known to use existing resources and include elements from other sources.\nsatoshi was talking to many people, cypherfunks, sourceforge, IRC, even this forum was developed so that he could collaborate with others.\nno denying that,\nbut it was satoshi, a single entity/person that put all the puzzle pieces of other peoples work together into one seamless and working project. even the white paper credits multiple people on the last page.. so yes, its true he didnt make every technology from scratch, many coders use functions that already exist.. but it was satoshi that pieced it together and utilised other peoples ideas in ways no one else thought of\n* The thing just freakin works as soon as it is released with no problems. This is very suspect and unusual. Anyone who ever did programming knows that nothing works like that unless it has been EXTENSIVELY tested for months and months (if not years). That requires a lot of skill and resources, more than any individual has.\nthey were testing it for months. infact on day one, satoshi (again only one person using the pseudonym) had people like hal finney, |)ruid and others all working together and debugging it as they went on. if you compare the very very first release of bitcoin in january 2009 to lets say the release in december 2009, the code is very different. because there were bugs. and by the time of december 2009 there were dozens of people working with bitcoin, debugging and adding new code/features.\neven in 2016 its not perfect, many people say that satoshi could/should have gone in a different direction or included different code libraries.. so satoshi was not god.\nhe was though the single inventer that made the puzzle complete. utilising other peoples puzzle pieces and then open sourcing his puzzle to debug it\n* The paper was released at the beginning of the year (suspicious.... implies it was professionally scheduled)\nit was released late part of 2008 actually, but oh well\nLets also remember at this point that most of the protocols behind the internet were invented by the US government. It's a no brainer.\nBasically this is a 100% US government project (I think US &amp; UK, given the mix of spellings). It is 100% a team that worked on it and it was an idea that was worked on for years until it was released.\nnah, the spelling is due to the racist nature of web browsers thinking that america dominates the world and makes people spell american style purely by having that irritating red line underneath british spellings. where as adobe and microsoft word (offline writing tools) are less racist and let UK folk write how we want without much irritation. so i can easily see why the PDF looks more british than online posts\nas for the technology being american government.. well actually TCP/IP, HTML, Java, C++ was an international effort. but highly adopted later by america, and then the whole world had to pander to the american way.\nso assuming he must be american purely because he used the internet and c++.. shows you might not be thinking out side of the box..\n50 years in the future we will know when the files come out. Until then everything else in the media is a false flag. That's another reason why satoshi is so effective at keeping\nhis\nsilence and will never return.

Also it is no coincidence the marshalls coins went to one of the most established and trusted American VCs.\nso after that long amount of assumptions.. even your subconcious mind truly thinks satoshi was a single person.. by you saying \"his silence\" instead of \"their silence\".\nim safe to assume you have yet to truly convince yourself that satoshi wasnt just one entity. whether you realise it or not\nall in all i dont think satoshi was a god.\nand here is an analogy.\nmany many many years ago, people realised they could turn wheat into flour\nmany many many years ago, people realised eggs could be eaten by humans\nmany many many years ago, people realised cows milk was not just for calves\nmany many many years ago, people realised putting these things together made dough\nmany many many years ago, people realised sugar tasted nice and sweet\nmany many many years ago, people realised food colourings added nice aesthetics to otherwise bland looking food.\nbut it was only one person that made the very first fully decorated colourful icing cake. by  putting it all together\nand then within hours others helped by making it better tweaking the ingredients colours, amount of icing, adding a bit of chocolate to improve flavouring.\n(basically debugging it as the cake wasnt perfect)\n(not important side note: while writing this i have irritating red lines for colour and flavour, but i didnt edit them to make a point)\niced cakes today are not the exact same recipe as that very first invention.. and is it really important that the first cake chef is discovered and praised as a god? or do we just eat our cake and be happy\nI enjoyed reading your Legendary post.\n\"We've been Franked!\"\nmany many many years ago, people realised they could turn wheat into flour\nThe people who\n\"basically debugged\"\nthe flour forgot to consider/test what a gluten-filled diet would eventually do to humans.\n", "author": "Bit_Happy Legendary Offline Activity: 1778 Merit: 1004 A Great Time to Start Something!
