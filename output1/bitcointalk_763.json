If there's decent positive take up I'll move forward with it.\nAs most of us will remember, and some of us still be in pain about, Mt Gox fell about a year ago now, taking vast reserves and a chunk of the good name of cryptocurrencies with it. Since then we've moved on. DACs and distributed exchanges have been developed and we're all far more savvy in using third party services. However, I think we're also starting to forget the full sweep of the fall and how it hit us so hard so early on.\nI'm proposing then that we capture our collective memory of what happened before it fades. As a starting point, but over to you guys if there's a better way, I've put up a small wiki site here:\nhttp://willyreport.com/\nAnd seeded it with the basics. The site is under creative common's license. I've no personal beef with Mt Gox - I didn't lose money - but I'm passionate about helping us move on to a better world. I also know that this is just an aside in the story ark we're all on. But nevertheless I think it's important to record and remember now. Any thoughts?

I started thinking but not in a negative way how important adoption was by date \"x\".\nLets propose for a minute that the miners with farms are using this purely as a money venture and that there is no care for bitcoin outside what they can mine and dump i.e. as long as cost of miners and power &lt; profit from coin = win. At the same time the miners are important for our transactions to keep the network strong.\nSo i got thinking... is there a day x where adoption/market saturation should reach a certain point to ensure the future strong growth? This day x i'm assuming would be a point where minimal coins enter the market because of costs and reward per block. If mining becomes more unfeasible and people leave the game if we don't have the adoption and use in the market would it be in danger?\nWould it be harder to foster a growing bitcoin market if less coins were entering the market for new adopters to acquire? I'm assuming coins at $2000 would be less attractive to the market as new people would compare it to fiat and feel more comfortable with that due to costings?\nJust some ramblings related to coins left to required market adoption.

If there's decent positive take up I'll move forward with it.\nAs most of us will remember, and some of us still be in pain about, Mt Gox fell about a year ago now, taking vast reserves and a chunk of the good name of cryptocurrencies with it. Since then we've moved on. DACs and distributed exchanges have been developed and we're all far more savvy in using third party services. However, I think we're also starting to forget the full sweep of the fall and how it hit us so hard so early on.\nI'm proposing then that we capture our collective memory of what happened before it fades. As a starting point, but over to you guys if there's a better way, I've put up a small wiki site here:\nhttp://willyreport.com/\nAnd seeded it with the basics. The site is under creative common's license. I've no personal beef with Mt Gox - I didn't lose money - but I'm passionate about helping us move on to a better world. I also know that this is just an aside in the story ark we're all on. But nevertheless I think it's important to record and remember now. Any thoughts?

I started thinking but not in a negative way how important adoption was by date \"x\".\nLets propose for a minute that the miners with farms are using this purely as a money venture and that there is no care for bitcoin outside what they can mine and dump i.e. as long as cost of miners and power &lt; profit from coin = win. At the same time the miners are important for our transactions to keep the network strong.\nSo i got thinking... is there a day x where adoption/market saturation should reach a certain point to ensure the future strong growth? This day x i'm assuming would be a point where minimal coins enter the market because of costs and reward per block. If mining becomes more unfeasible and people leave the game if we don't have the adoption and use in the market would it be in danger?\nWould it be harder to foster a growing bitcoin market if less coins were entering the market for new adopters to acquire? I'm assuming coins at $2000 would be less attractive to the market as new people would compare it to fiat and feel more comfortable with that due to costings?\nJust some ramblings related to coins left to required market adoption.
