Anyone can create a genesis block (which is why there are so many alts), but the power of bitcoin is consensus created around the block chain and the amount of computational power behind it.\nToday we are at block 301,981.\nIf you were to visualize the block chain it would be a single very very long chain, with a very small number of orphan chains, sort of like tiny threads that branch off and quickly die. Most orphan chains are only 1 block long, a very small number are 2 blocks long and in March 2013 the fork caused an orphan chain of only 40 or so blocks.\nThen there is a massive amount of computational power that goes into \"building\" this chain, and any small branch quickly dies because this computation power quickly shifts to the longest branch, growing the chain forever.\nShowing the block chain as a single long entity to me really represents how the block chain is used to maintain consensus globally and just how powerful bitcoin is.\nI have zero artistic ability, but think it would be awesome if someone could find a way to visualize the block chain.\n", "author": "rocks Legendary Offline Activity: 1153 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-05-21 23:59:26", "content": "Nice artwork.\ndo you making those just for fun?\n", "author": "Bibop Full Member Offline Activity: 222 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-05-22 00:10:38", "content": "These are incredible.

Anyone can create a genesis block (which is why there are so many alts), but the power of bitcoin is consensus created around the block chain and the amount of computational power behind it.\nToday we are at block 301,981.\nIf you were to visualize the block chain it would be a single very very long chain, with a very small number of orphan chains, sort of like tiny threads that branch off and quickly die. Most orphan chains are only 1 block long, a very small number are 2 blocks long and in March 2013 the fork caused an orphan chain of only 40 or so blocks.\nThen there is a massive amount of computational power that goes into \"building\" this chain, and any small branch quickly dies because this computation power quickly shifts to the longest branch, growing the chain forever.\nShowing the block chain as a single long entity to me really represents how the block chain is used to maintain consensus globally and just how powerful bitcoin is.\nI have zero artistic ability, but think it would be awesome if someone could find a way to visualize the block chain.\n", "author": "rocks Legendary Offline Activity: 1153 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-05-21 23:59:26", "content": "Nice artwork.\ndo you making those just for fun?\n", "author": "Bibop Full Member Offline Activity: 222 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-05-22 00:10:38", "content": "These are incredible.
