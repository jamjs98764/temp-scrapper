Thanks in advance for any help!\nIt is the most easy thing to do. And the safest one. Bitcoin always go there when is sent. There are to many ways to realize your wish. I am giving my three year experience to you with only few steps; very simple steps. Then naturally you can do what you think. First you need a wallet to store your bitcoin. I use for almost three years Coinbase. For me a fantastic wallet. You can register spending not more than 2-3 minutes (including 2 step verification which make you 100% sure that only you can enter there). Coinbase has to many advantages which you can read yourself if will go at their site. I can name only one which affect direct your bitcoins. You don't pay any kind of fee when send bitcoins. Then you need bitcoin. May be several ways to have some but the most easy thing to do, is to buy some. If chose this way, I suggest cex.io to buy. Can be bought within 3-4 minutes and send in your wallet within 1-2 minutes. You will need more time only the first bought during which needed to make some verifications. Then from the second one you will have the above mentioned by me times. So you need to open an account in cex.io, deposit money from your credit card and buy bitcoin. Everything is very clear if you enter in your account at cex.io. After the bought you can withdraw those and within seconds they will be at your wallet.

I am giving my three year experience to you with only few steps; very simple steps. Then naturally you can do what you think. First you need a wallet to store your bitcoin. I use for almost three years Coinbase. For me a fantastic wallet. You can register spending not more than 2-3 minutes (including 2 step verification which make you 100% sure that only you can enter there). Coinbase has to many advantages which you can read yourself if will go at their site. I can name only one which affect direct your bitcoins. You don't pay any kind of fee when send bitcoins. Then you need bitcoin. May be several ways to have some but the most easy thing to do, is to buy some. If chose this way, I suggest cex.io to buy. Can be bought within 3-4 minutes and send in your wallet within 1-2 minutes. You will need more time only the first bought during which needed to make some verifications. Then from the second one you will have the above mentioned by me times. So you need to open an account in cex.io, deposit money from your credit card and buy bitcoin. Everything is very clear if you enter in your account at cex.io. After the bought you can withdraw those and within seconds they will be at your wallet.

For example you can try multibit hd (just google it, download and install it). Encrypt your wallet (I think you can do it in your installation proccess) and send your bitcoins from coinbase to multibit HD.\nSetup the backups in multibit hd and store your passphrase in a safe place.\nI think that is quite safe, but you can also make paper wallets and all (which I have no idea how to do)\n", "author": "maokoto Hero Member Offline Activity: 770 Merit: 500 ✪ NEXCHANGE | BTC, LTC, ETH &amp; DOGE ✪ "}, {"date": "2016-01-11 14:47:43", "content": "Try Xapo and you can open an e-wallet account at the same time.\nwww.xapo.com\n", "author": "fuathan Hero Member Offline Activity: 812 Merit: 512 "}, {"date": "2016-01-11 16:49:19", "content": "Having the secured feeling are somewhat we are trying to cope when using such new technology.\nBut try to find more resource of about the technology and the wallet\ntry to search about \"multisig bitcoin\" on youtube that will give you the finer perspective about the security\nand after that knowledge, choose the best way you feel more comfortable about buying the bitcoin\nthrough exchanger? local meetup?\n", "author": "yohanip Full Member Offline Activity: 122 Merit: 100 A Programmer "}, {"date": "2016-01-11 17:14:38", "content": "You should give us some more information...

If they did $880 would have been 183 BTC during that post which is now worth $82,802 (Assuming they went into a coma after spending $880) today. If they paid attention, that would be more or less $219,600 in 2013.\nDo we have better materials now to present to Boomers?\nThe reality is that Boomers aren't really subject to change or take a chance that much.  I'm sure if you presented the same person that Phinnaeus Gage presented this too (if he actually did), then the person will probably feel discouraged to go into bitcoin, because that $880 that a boomer could have invested will only get the person less than 2 BTC, rather than getting the 183 BTC they could have gotten.\nI don't think Boomers are going to look at Bitcoin as currency, just merely a speculative stock that they can't or won't want to learn about.  When you present them with gold, they can at least wrap their minds around why it would be beneficial to them to invest there, because it's way less volatile/risky.\nI've tried to influence my parents and other family that are on the older side to buy into bitcoin around this time, and they just merely laughed and scoffed at me.  They are just looking forward to collecting their social security checks and living happily ever after.  So I just kind of stopped trying to attempt to explain my view point, and just worry about my self now.\n", "author": "chennan Legendary Offline Activity: 1316 Merit: 1004 "}], "date": "2012-03-20 16:32:50"}, {"content": "Sorry if this question asked in wrong place or too stupid to ask.\nI'm a frequent bitcoins user as well as investor, but I didn't really understand how different bitcoin wallets client works.\nI want something that's safe, not relying on third party, but also comes with mobility, right now I'm using MyCelium HD Wallet.\nSo just quick question, does HD Wallet (MyCelium Android wallet),\nrelies on 3rd party\n?\nThe recover key were 12 different words, is it\npossible to recover\nmy wallet with this 12 different words on different client ?\nWhat is the safest wallet that met below criteria ?\nDoesn't rely on 3rd party\nMobility(Apps/easy to recover on different devices)\nSecurity\n", "views": 879, "author": "outofmind Member Offline Activity: 84 Merit: 10 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat does HD Wallets meaning ?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-01-09 04:11:42", "content": "Sorry if this question asked in wrong place or too stupid to ask.\nI'm a frequent bitcoins user as well as investor, but I didn't really understand how different bitcoin wallets client works.\nI want something that's safe, not relying on third party, but also comes with mobility, right now I'm using MyCelium HD Wallet.\nSo just quick question, does HD Wallet (MyCelium Android wallet),\nrelies on 3rd party\n?\nThe recover key were 12 different words, is it\npossible to recover\nmy wallet with this 12 different words on different client ?\nWhat is the safest wallet that met below criteria ?\nDoesn't rely on 3rd party\nMobility(Apps/easy to recover on different devices)\nSecurity\nAll the same, there is a list of which relies on 3rd party and which does not on the bitcoin.orp's official page;\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet\nHD means hyperdeterministic.
