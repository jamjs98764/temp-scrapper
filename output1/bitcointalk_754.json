The remaining transactions would have to be re-confirmed on the full network.\nIn Satoshi's own words back in 2010:\nIt's hard to imagine the Internet getting segmented airtight.  It would have to be a country deliberately and totally cutting itself off from the rest of the world.\nAny node with access to both sides would automatically flow the block chain over, such as someone getting around the blockade with a dial-up modem or sat-phone.  It would only take one node to do it.  Anyone who wants to keep doing business would be motivated.\nIf the network is segmented and then recombines, any transactions in the shorter fork that were not also in the longer fork are released into the transaction pool again and are eligible to get into future blocks.  Their number of confirmations would start over.\nIf anyone took advantage of the segmentation to double-spend, such that there are different spends of the same money on each side, then the double-spends in the shorter fork lose out and go to 0/unconfirmed and stay that way.\nIt wouldn't be easy to take advantage of the segmentation to double-spend.  If it's impossible to communicate from one side to the other, how are you going to put a spend on each side?  If there is a way, then probably someone else is also using it to flow the block chain over.\nYou would usually know whether you're in the smaller segment.  For example, if your country cuts itself off from the rest of the world, the rest of the world is the larger segment.  If you're in the smaller segment, you should assume nothing is confirmed.\n", "author": "DannyHamilton Legendary Offline Activity: 2198 Merit: 1371 "}, {"date": "2014-12-10 14:24:48", "content": "Depends really which countries.\nThere would be quite a number with no pools worth speaking of, and probably no large solo concerns. So if they were cut off, all their miners would drop off the foreign pools and all the nodes would just get a huge backlog of unconfirmed tx. Provided, nobody does something stupid like think \"Hey, we need to process these tx\" and get up a temporary pool. Then when the rest of the network reconnects the backlog would be processed. Otherwise, any tx that do get processed will be orphaned with the blocks they are in.\nWhere it would get \"interesting\" is if maybe China got cut off, and because of cross border pooling, it would be hard to tell if you were on the winning or losing side of the deal. i.e. the network hash left on the network might only be 40% of it, and you would be unsure if maybe 5%, 10%, 20% was cut off from outside China pools, whether it's reconnecting inside China, or what is happening, same if you were inside China and looking at only 40%.\nAlso could happen with north american outage maybe, not sure.\nAt a quick spitball, though the exact figure is debatable. I'd say that if you are on the side of the split where network hash is 30% or less, the responsible thing to do would be to turn your miners off. You will not gain anything, and by reducing hash further you prevent tx being processed and thus orphaned, so are doing least damage, and it's more to your personal benefit to at least save on the electricity at this point.\nHowever, over about 30% without any information about what is happening, then it may be wiser to keep the miners spinning. There could be a good chunk of hashpower \"disabled\" by the split, and it may appear on your side or the other side, or not at all. It's also possible that certain countries getting cut off, could cause more fracturing of the internet than just a 2 way split. i.e. 3 or 4 way splits. In that situation, 30% might produce the longest chain, make the most blocks, and be the \"winner\" when everything gets back together again.\n", "author": "Flashman Hero Member Offline Activity: 518 Merit: 500 Hodl!

Last year, the Syrian government took down the entire coutnry's internet for two days. However, not every country's internet infrasture is as simple and centralized. In countries with more complex infrastructures, tweaking router configurations alone is not enough to turn off the internet. Fiber optics gateways must also be physically cut, along with signal jamming at border areas.\nRenesys took a close look at this subject a couple of years ago, and computed the risk factors of countries going offline. In the map below, the green spectrum indicates a country's susceptibility to disconnection - dark green for high risk, and light green for very low risk. The firm argued that light green countries are highly resistant to complete internet shutdown.\nAs you can see, most first world countries (including G7 countries) fare well in their estimation.\nI wonder if there are any Syrian forum members around that could share their experience in the wake of last year's two days' blackout.\n", "author": "rugrats Sr. Member Offline Activity: 364 Merit: 250 🤖UBEX.COM 🤖 "}], "date": "2014-12-10 11:27:49"}, {"content": "https://www.theprotocol.tv/micah-winkelspecht-gem/\nMicah Winkelspecht is founder and CEO of Gem, a secure and simple platform for Bitcoin developers.

One donor (who wants to remain anonymous for now) has agreed to cover all costs for the written submission that is due in a few weeks. This made it possible for me to hire\nMannheimer Swartling\n, a very reputable Swedish law firm with the necessary experience of the EU court as well as VAT questions related to financial institutions. This means that I am\nnot\nlooking for more funds at this point. We will assess the financial situation again if and when there is an oral hearing coming up. At that point it\nmight\nbe necessary to raise more funds.\nBig thanks to everyone who has contributed so far! (money, legal assistance, contacts etc.  I have received a lot of friendly e-mails and phone calls this past week).\nI now have a lot of contacts that can offer insight into the situation in other EU countries. I will pass this information on to my lawyer and we will of course try to learn as much as possible about the legal status in other countries but there won't be time to talk to everyone. There is one thing that everyone in other EU countries can do to help and that is to lobby your own government! All EU countries have the oppurtunity to intervene in the case and the more countries we have on our side the better.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal post\nAs some of you may already know there is an ongoing case regarding Bitcoin and VAT exemption in Sweden and the EU. The Supreme Administrative Court (Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen) has now requested a preliminary ruling from the EU Court of Justice. The case, C-264/14, can be found\nhere\nand has been covered quite a lot in media (\nBloomberg\n,\nLaw360\n,\nCoinDesk\n).\nI got involved in this simply by asking for an advance ruling in Sweden because I wanted to start selling bitcoin on my site bitcoin.se. It has now escalated and I find myself in a situation where my case will likely decide if and how VAT should be applied to Bitcoin throughout the EU.\nIt took me a while to realize the significance of this case and I have to appoint a top law firm team here in Sweden that can prepare a written submission (and were short on time here - this has to be done in 3 weeks) as well as a potential oral hearing later on. The Swedish counsel will also cooperate with interested parties throughout Europe to get input and support from other European countries if deemed necessary. I am currently discussing with teams at three of Swedens top firms in VAT and EU-law. After asking about the costs I have received fee estimates that range from 22 000 to 38 000 EUR (approximately 56 to 96 bitcoin at the time of writing).\nSo here is my problem. There is no way that I can finance this personally. I dont have enough commercial interest in the case to throw all of my savings on it, the business that we wanted to start on bitcoin.se has not been launched so there is no money there. This is why I am now reaching out to the Bitcoin community.\nDisclaimer: Donating is in no way a guarantee that we will win the case but if I cant raise the money the risks are dramatically increased that I will lose since I will have to deal with the court proceedings on my own (which one of the parties I have discussed the case with has described as catastrophical for Bitcoin in Europe).\nIf the donated money is in excess of the costs I will donate the excess funds to Bitcoin organizations in Europe. If, for some reason, none of the funds raised are used I will return all bitcoins to the sender address (so make sure that you donate from an address that you control!)\n-----------------------------------------------------\nPlease send your donations to this Bitcoin address:\n(no more donations necessary at this point)\n-----------------------------------------------------\nAbout me\nMy name is David Hedqvist and have been running bitcoin.se since early 2012.

This has been a dream of the Bitcoin faithful for some time; now, the technology is showing signs of evolving to support the ambitions.\nThe hopes rest on the adaptability of the blockchain, the distributed, public ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. This is one of the main innovations that have fed hopes that the ideas behind the digital currency make it more than just a haven for speculators, drug dealers and crypto-anarchists.\nEssentially, the blockchain provides a way to transfer value between two people online without the need for any central authority to validate the transaction. When a bitcoin is bought and sold, both parties can be certain the digital bits have been transferred and cant be copied or replicated elsewhere.\nBringing that kind of certainty to peer-to-peer activities in a distributed digital marketplace is quite a feat. Imagine what it could do to buying and selling tokens that represent other assets, such as shares or houses. The potential uses are limited only by the imagination  and the tech entrepreneurs being drawn to Bitcoin have plenty of that.\nRather than representing just digital assets, for instance, entries in the blockchain could represent virtual keys that could be used to claim ownership of physical assets, such as cars, or to verify identity. From passports to wills to patents, the theoretical uses seem limitless.\nReality, however, has been slow to catch up. Bobby Goodlatte, an angel investor in Silicon Valley who has backed two Bitcoin companies, sums up the current state of the art: Its really early, and a lot of stuff has been over-promised.\nAdam Shapiro, of Promontory Financial Group, adds that separating the blockchain from its Bitcoin roots will not be simple. Its become fashionable for people to talk about being a fan of the blockchain and not of Bitcoin, he says, but because they involve a transfer of value, all the potential uses are Bitcoin-like to some degree and so at least a little bit financial services.\nFrom registrars to escrow agents  the world would never be the same again\nTweet this quote\nThe blockchain was not developed with other digital assets or smart contracts in mind and building on top of it causes other problems, says Adam Back, a British developer who came up with a key piece of the Bitcoin infrastructure. Its a little bit of a hack, really, he says of attempts to adapt the technology.\nOne response has been the creation of alternative blockchains. One of the most ambitious projects, Ethereum, hopes to launch a network soon for contracts based on its own unit of currency, known as ether. But ideas like this involve starting afresh, making them all-or-nothing bets that dont draw on the headway already made by Bitcoin.\nThe latest buzz to spread through the cyber currency world involves sidechains, or ledgers designed with specific purposes in mind  a market for trading equities, for instance  that are still pegged to Bitcoin, rather than requiring the creation of an entirely new currency. If it works, this would keep the network effects of being part of the Bitcoin world while freeing developers to come up with new models for cyber-transactions.\nBlockstream, the company that Mr Back and a handful of other prominent Bitcoin developers have set up to create this infrastructure, raised more than $20m last month from luminaries such as Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Eric Schmidt of Google. That is a colossal amount for an initial seed round of financing, and a sign of the high hopes.\nIn the longer term, says Mr Back, shares or other forms of property could be issued directly through a sidechain, as well as being bought and sold that way. For all the intermediaries involved in those markets  from the registrars to the brokers and escrow agents  the world would never be the same again.\nThe potent technology of Bitcoin has always made it a good place for dreamers, and version 2.0 raises even more disruptive possibilities than its predecessor. The implications for a wide range of online interactions are intriguing  just as long as it can survive the inevitable hype.\n", "author": "miztaziggy Sr. Member Offline Activity: 469 Merit: 500 Decentralize $15-Trillion Global Trade Industry "}], "date": "2014-12-05 00:49:15"}], "posts": [{"content": "CoinScrums event at 93 Feet East marked the end of a year full of busy and diverse meetups and, the launch of Proof of Work.

The remaining transactions would have to be re-confirmed on the full network.\nIn Satoshi's own words back in 2010:\nIt's hard to imagine the Internet getting segmented airtight.  It would have to be a country deliberately and totally cutting itself off from the rest of the world.\nAny node with access to both sides would automatically flow the block chain over, such as someone getting around the blockade with a dial-up modem or sat-phone.  It would only take one node to do it.  Anyone who wants to keep doing business would be motivated.\nIf the network is segmented and then recombines, any transactions in the shorter fork that were not also in the longer fork are released into the transaction pool again and are eligible to get into future blocks.  Their number of confirmations would start over.\nIf anyone took advantage of the segmentation to double-spend, such that there are different spends of the same money on each side, then the double-spends in the shorter fork lose out and go to 0/unconfirmed and stay that way.\nIt wouldn't be easy to take advantage of the segmentation to double-spend.  If it's impossible to communicate from one side to the other, how are you going to put a spend on each side?  If there is a way, then probably someone else is also using it to flow the block chain over.\nYou would usually know whether you're in the smaller segment.  For example, if your country cuts itself off from the rest of the world, the rest of the world is the larger segment.  If you're in the smaller segment, you should assume nothing is confirmed.\n", "author": "DannyHamilton Legendary Offline Activity: 2198 Merit: 1371 "}, {"date": "2014-12-10 14:24:48", "content": "Depends really which countries.\nThere would be quite a number with no pools worth speaking of, and probably no large solo concerns. So if they were cut off, all their miners would drop off the foreign pools and all the nodes would just get a huge backlog of unconfirmed tx. Provided, nobody does something stupid like think \"Hey, we need to process these tx\" and get up a temporary pool. Then when the rest of the network reconnects the backlog would be processed. Otherwise, any tx that do get processed will be orphaned with the blocks they are in.\nWhere it would get \"interesting\" is if maybe China got cut off, and because of cross border pooling, it would be hard to tell if you were on the winning or losing side of the deal. i.e. the network hash left on the network might only be 40% of it, and you would be unsure if maybe 5%, 10%, 20% was cut off from outside China pools, whether it's reconnecting inside China, or what is happening, same if you were inside China and looking at only 40%.\nAlso could happen with north american outage maybe, not sure.\nAt a quick spitball, though the exact figure is debatable. I'd say that if you are on the side of the split where network hash is 30% or less, the responsible thing to do would be to turn your miners off. You will not gain anything, and by reducing hash further you prevent tx being processed and thus orphaned, so are doing least damage, and it's more to your personal benefit to at least save on the electricity at this point.\nHowever, over about 30% without any information about what is happening, then it may be wiser to keep the miners spinning. There could be a good chunk of hashpower \"disabled\" by the split, and it may appear on your side or the other side, or not at all. It's also possible that certain countries getting cut off, could cause more fracturing of the internet than just a 2 way split. i.e. 3 or 4 way splits. In that situation, 30% might produce the longest chain, make the most blocks, and be the \"winner\" when everything gets back together again.\n", "author": "Flashman Hero Member Offline Activity: 518 Merit: 500 Hodl!

Last year, the Syrian government took down the entire coutnry's internet for two days. However, not every country's internet infrasture is as simple and centralized. In countries with more complex infrastructures, tweaking router configurations alone is not enough to turn off the internet. Fiber optics gateways must also be physically cut, along with signal jamming at border areas.\nRenesys took a close look at this subject a couple of years ago, and computed the risk factors of countries going offline. In the map below, the green spectrum indicates a country's susceptibility to disconnection - dark green for high risk, and light green for very low risk. The firm argued that light green countries are highly resistant to complete internet shutdown.\nAs you can see, most first world countries (including G7 countries) fare well in their estimation.\nI wonder if there are any Syrian forum members around that could share their experience in the wake of last year's two days' blackout.\n", "author": "rugrats Sr. Member Offline Activity: 364 Merit: 250 🤖UBEX.COM 🤖 "}], "date": "2014-12-10 11:27:49"}, {"content": "https://www.theprotocol.tv/micah-winkelspecht-gem/\nMicah Winkelspecht is founder and CEO of Gem, a secure and simple platform for Bitcoin developers.

What I can see is that his focus has been more on networking and network security (including hardware too), whereas my experience has been on making million user commercial software and I have always been as well a theoretical thinker. So I approach this from a more broad perspective and apparently more experience in scaling than he has. He is obviously no technical slouch and I suspect we might have interesting conversations someday. I suspect I have a much more broad understanding of political economics and macro economics than he does. In short, he appears to me to be somewhat pigeon-holed.\nAnd end-to-end is why Cryptonote ring signatures are best for on chain anonymity. And we still need an improved high-latency Tor for IP anonymity to transmit the transaction to the network.\nIt doesn't matter if you use a pigeon to deliver your transaction to the network to hide your IP address, Bitcoin's block chain is traceable and linkable because it doesn't have ring signatures.\nAnd the lack of anonymity for the miners remains the choke hold point weakness in Bitcoin. Miners can be regulated and forced to reject transactions that don't attach KYC identity.\nSorry I already had this debate with you and we will not repeat it again.

The case, C-264/14, can be found\nhere\nand has been covered quite a lot in media (\nBloomberg\n,\nLaw360\n,\nCoinDesk\n).\nI got involved in this simply by asking for an advance ruling in Sweden because I wanted to start selling bitcoin on my site bitcoin.se. It has now escalated and I find myself in a situation where my case will likely decide if and how VAT should be applied to Bitcoin throughout the EU.\nIt took me a while to realize the significance of this case and I have to appoint a top law firm team here in Sweden that can prepare a written submission (and were short on time here - this has to be done in 3 weeks) as well as a potential oral hearing later on. The Swedish counsel will also cooperate with interested parties throughout Europe to get input and support from other European countries if deemed necessary. I am currently discussing with teams at three of Swedens top firms in VAT and EU-law. After asking about the costs I have received fee estimates that range from 22 000 to 38 000 EUR (approximately 56 to 96 bitcoin at the time of writing).\nSo here is my problem. There is no way that I can finance this personally. I dont have enough commercial interest in the case to throw all of my savings on it, the business that we wanted to start on bitcoin.se has not been launched so there is no money there. This is why I am now reaching out to the Bitcoin community.\nDisclaimer: Donating is in no way a guarantee that we will win the case but if I cant raise the money the risks are dramatically increased that I will lose since I will have to deal with the court proceedings on my own (which one of the parties I have discussed the case with has described as catastrophical for Bitcoin in Europe).\nIf the donated money is in excess of the costs I will donate the excess funds to Bitcoin organizations in Europe. If, for some reason, none of the funds raised are used I will return all bitcoins to the sender address (so make sure that you donate from an address that you control!)\n-----------------------------------------------------\nPlease send your donations to this Bitcoin address:\n(no more donations necessary at this point)\n-----------------------------------------------------\nAbout me\nMy name is David Hedqvist and have been running bitcoin.se since early 2012.

This has been a dream of the Bitcoin faithful for some time; now, the technology is showing signs of evolving to support the ambitions.\nThe hopes rest on the adaptability of the blockchain, the distributed, public ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. This is one of the main innovations that have fed hopes that the ideas behind the digital currency make it more than just a haven for speculators, drug dealers and crypto-anarchists.\nEssentially, the blockchain provides a way to transfer value between two people online without the need for any central authority to validate the transaction. When a bitcoin is bought and sold, both parties can be certain the digital bits have been transferred and cant be copied or replicated elsewhere.\nBringing that kind of certainty to peer-to-peer activities in a distributed digital marketplace is quite a feat. Imagine what it could do to buying and selling tokens that represent other assets, such as shares or houses. The potential uses are limited only by the imagination  and the tech entrepreneurs being drawn to Bitcoin have plenty of that.\nRather than representing just digital assets, for instance, entries in the blockchain could represent virtual keys that could be used to claim ownership of physical assets, such as cars, or to verify identity. From passports to wills to patents, the theoretical uses seem limitless.\nReality, however, has been slow to catch up. Bobby Goodlatte, an angel investor in Silicon Valley who has backed two Bitcoin companies, sums up the current state of the art: Its really early, and a lot of stuff has been over-promised.\nAdam Shapiro, of Promontory Financial Group, adds that separating the blockchain from its Bitcoin roots will not be simple. Its become fashionable for people to talk about being a fan of the blockchain and not of Bitcoin, he says, but because they involve a transfer of value, all the potential uses are Bitcoin-like to some degree and so at least a little bit financial services.\nFrom registrars to escrow agents  the world would never be the same again\nTweet this quote\nThe blockchain was not developed with other digital assets or smart contracts in mind and building on top of it causes other problems, says Adam Back, a British developer who came up with a key piece of the Bitcoin infrastructure. Its a little bit of a hack, really, he says of attempts to adapt the technology.\nOne response has been the creation of alternative blockchains. One of the most ambitious projects, Ethereum, hopes to launch a network soon for contracts based on its own unit of currency, known as ether. But ideas like this involve starting afresh, making them all-or-nothing bets that dont draw on the headway already made by Bitcoin.\nThe latest buzz to spread through the cyber currency world involves sidechains, or ledgers designed with specific purposes in mind  a market for trading equities, for instance  that are still pegged to Bitcoin, rather than requiring the creation of an entirely new currency. If it works, this would keep the network effects of being part of the Bitcoin world while freeing developers to come up with new models for cyber-transactions.\nBlockstream, the company that Mr Back and a handful of other prominent Bitcoin developers have set up to create this infrastructure, raised more than $20m last month from luminaries such as Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and Eric Schmidt of Google. That is a colossal amount for an initial seed round of financing, and a sign of the high hopes.\nIn the longer term, says Mr Back, shares or other forms of property could be issued directly through a sidechain, as well as being bought and sold that way. For all the intermediaries involved in those markets  from the registrars to the brokers and escrow agents  the world would never be the same again.\nThe potent technology of Bitcoin has always made it a good place for dreamers, and version 2.0 raises even more disruptive possibilities than its predecessor. The implications for a wide range of online interactions are intriguing  just as long as it can survive the inevitable hype.\n", "author": "miztaziggy Sr. Member Offline Activity: 469 Merit: 500 Decentralize $15-Trillion Global Trade Industry "}], "date": "2014-12-05 00:49:15"}]}
