I mean, anyone who's read about this stuff knows there are a lot of people in western countries who openly preach jihad. Hell, in Britain and France they collect welfare checks, and everyone knows who they are and no one does shit about it. I read after those French attacks that the police knew about the attackers but there are\ntoo many\njihadis in France to watch all of them.\nWhat if there was something like that bitcoin bounty hunter site but targetting jihadis in the west. The press always goes apeshit calling people against jihad \"racists\" and trying to shut them up, so it's important for antijihadists to be anonymous. Well, plus there's the possibility of getting your fucking head cut off or burned alive.\nActually it's clear nothing can be done about today's jihad problem until the powers that be stop making people lie about \"Islam being all about peace\" and shit. Maybe the best thing would be to have a bitcoin bounty hunter program to go after the journalists who protect jihadis and lie about what they believe. You know, the kind of people who believe in\ndiversity\nso much that they think it was beautiful sign of\ndiversity\nin 630 when Mohammed invaded Mecca and destroyed all the other diverse religions because it brought about, um,\nunity\n.\nJournalists are afraid to report the truth. They're even afraid to show those drawings. Maybe someone could use bitcoin and Tor and other tools to make them afraid to lie, to make them afraid\nnot\nto show the drawings.\nEh, it's just a dream. Obviously isn't going to happen. The truth is that the people we currently call \"terrorists\" are going to win the future, because they're the only one's who want to.

I read after those French attacks that the police knew about the attackers but there are\ntoo many\njihadis in France to watch all of them.\nWhat if there was something like that bitcoin bounty hunter site but targetting jihadis in the west. The press always goes apeshit calling people against jihad \"racists\" and trying to shut them up, so it's important for antijihadists to be anonymous. Well, plus there's the possibility of getting your fucking head cut off or burned alive.\nActually it's clear nothing can be done about today's jihad problem until the powers that be stop making people lie about \"Islam being all about peace\" and shit. Maybe the best thing would be to have a bitcoin bounty hunter program to go after the journalists who protect jihadis and lie about what they believe. You know, the kind of people who believe in\ndiversity\nso much that they think it was beautiful sign of\ndiversity\nin 630 when Mohammed invaded Mecca and destroyed all the other diverse religions because it brought about, um,\nunity\n.\nJournalists are afraid to report the truth.
