This is how they're trying to fight Bitcoin since they're sheep are easy to redirect into another way. You should not worry about it. Bitcoin and blockchain technology have their own places. Bitcoin is a revolution to say at least. Blockchain technology is going to be helpful in many systems (make them efficient and whatnot). Bitcoin is technology based on a protocol that is constantly evolving.\n\"Bitcoin is a value transfer ownership registration protocol with a currency on top. It can do a lot more than traditional payment networks can't.\" In addition to giving you money sovereignty (which is why media and banks call it \"useless\"\n).\n", "author": "Lauda Legendary Offline Activity: 1974 Merit: 1585 GUNBOT Licenses up to 70% OFF - 'GrumpyKitty'.

So far this seems like the most cogent and viable strategy for banks to confront bitcoin that I have seen yet, and basically what it does is clone bitcoin, but use all of the wealth and power available to replace the current set of early adopters with the established elite.\nOf course one has to weigh the drawbacks for the banks- declining income from fees that can no longer be charged, shrinking of the fractional reserve deposit system as use of the cryptocurrency rises. Fractional reserve is a sword that cuts both ways- while deposits enable many times the amount of the deposit to be issued as interest bearing loans, as deposit volume declines the loan issuing potential declines by the same multiplier.\nThere is also the interest that is charged in the delay time on international transfers. Ultimately, in the final cost-benefit analysis I really think that for the bank to create a bitcoin clone that reinforces their power would require either such structural changes to the global financial system as to make it too risky for the present elite, or changes to the fundamental structure of the protocol as to lose some of the basic advantages of bitcoin.\nOf course, a basic component of the banks power is the power of deception, and I wouldn't underestimate their ability to suck a large number of people into their scam, however, since many of the people involved in bitcoin are the smartest and most dynamic people on earth I don't think they will be fooled, and bitcoin's value will be determined in part by the extent of their influence.\nI actually really wouldn't be surprised if this current media push is part of a coordinate p-r campaign with substantial capital backing it. And I honestly don't think that regulators are smart enough to understand the implications of what is coming- they are just trying to keep their jobs by pleasing their masters.\nThis whole drama gives the whole thing a nice air of a revolution. I think this really places a great responsibility on everyone in the bitcoin space to understand this development and work pro-actively toward education. While the power of the establishment sometime seems overwhelming, it actually is exceedingly fragile and teetering on a very delicate axis between inflationary and deflationary pressures. And the power of the truth is not to be underestimated, even if it may seem on the surface to be very fragile.\n", "author": "semaforo Hero Member Offline Activity: 728 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-10-17 18:16:21", "content": "It's kind of scary for the poor dupes who buy into it- I mean, imagine a pump and dump coin spawned by someone with hundreds of billions of dollars to throw at their scam.\nDoes anyone truly believe there'll be an actual coin released on the open market by a retail bank?

That's why at TouTrix, we found many ways to achieve this and we need help.\nHow many people on the earth is living with advertising?\nFirst of all, we developed a WordPress plugin and then webmaster get paid by displaying ads on their site. 25% of the Internet is made with WordPress. It's a huge market for this plugin. Also, advertisers can spend bitcoins in the plugin to purchase advertising space.\nhttp://github.com/TouTrix/wp_toutrix\nAlso, we developed a Get Paid system. Everyone visiting our website can get a share of the advertising profit. Everything is automated. The more visit we have, the more we pay, and the more people have bitcoins. They can also share any page of our website and get paid for all traffic they bring.\nhttp://toutrix.com/get-paid/\nFinally, even for myself, spending bitcoin in real life is hard. In our city, there is no local store accepting bitcoin. We are preparing a franchise so we could open dozen and dozen bitcoin store everywhere accepting only bitcoin. Of course, they should all have an ATM to let people buy bitcoin.

So far this seems like the most cogent and viable strategy for banks to confront bitcoin that I have seen yet, and basically what it does is clone bitcoin, but use all of the wealth and power available to replace the current set of early adopters with the established elite.\nOf course one has to weigh the drawbacks for the banks- declining income from fees that can no longer be charged, shrinking of the fractional reserve deposit system as use of the cryptocurrency rises. Fractional reserve is a sword that cuts both ways- while deposits enable many times the amount of the deposit to be issued as interest bearing loans, as deposit volume declines the loan issuing potential declines by the same multiplier.\nThere is also the interest that is charged in the delay time on international transfers. Ultimately, in the final cost-benefit analysis I really think that for the bank to create a bitcoin clone that reinforces their power would require either such structural changes to the global financial system as to make it too risky for the present elite, or changes to the fundamental structure of the protocol as to lose some of the basic advantages of bitcoin.\nOf course, a basic component of the banks power is the power of deception, and I wouldn't underestimate their ability to suck a large number of people into their scam, however, since many of the people involved in bitcoin are the smartest and most dynamic people on earth I don't think they will be fooled, and bitcoin's value will be determined in part by the extent of their influence.\nI actually really wouldn't be surprised if this current media push is part of a coordinate p-r campaign with substantial capital backing it. And I honestly don't think that regulators are smart enough to understand the implications of what is coming- they are just trying to keep their jobs by pleasing their masters.\nThis whole drama gives the whole thing a nice air of a revolution. I think this really places a great responsibility on everyone in the bitcoin space to understand this development and work pro-actively toward education. While the power of the establishment sometime seems overwhelming, it actually is exceedingly fragile and teetering on a very delicate axis between inflationary and deflationary pressures.
