Means 1 MB blocks might have a hard time reaching &gt;50% and might get orphaned often.\nWhen we now get 20MB blocks at one point, shouldnt the problem worsen then? I mean i can imagine the incentive to mine 1 transaction blocks will be even higher because the p2p speed wont keep up with that i think.\n* Wont this be a problem?\nMaybe a solution is to spread headers first, so some data identifying a found block. These headers are spread through all nodes in light time. The blocks follow later and can be verified. A one transaction block verified faster gets still orphaned when a 20 MB block gets verified later. That would ensure that empty blocks are not worth it.\nThere would need to be a timeout. Spreading faked headers wouldnt help because they would need to match a found block.\n* Will this be a solution?\nThen... when the spam happened, why did miners chose the huge transactions over many small ones with smaller fees? Shouldnt they chose many small transactions and shouldnt they be able to put more transactions with more fees into the block that way? Or only use the blocks that have the highest fee per satoshi. It shouldnt go after the fee per transaction because big transactions use much space and propagation time. It doesnt make so much sense to chose huge transactions that slow down a block and prevent more transactions being implemented only because they have a higher fee than small transactions. Though maybe its already handled that way.\n* How is it handled and if not so why?\nAnd what someone mentioned today... when we really want adoption we might need to drop the idea of a max block size completely and implement something like fee per output, since in fact each is its own transaction and should be treated like that. Since no post office allows you to bring 100 letters in a big box and send them out to 100 locations for 5 times the price for one letter. No, you either can chose the price of 5 times a letter to ship all letters to one location or you pay the price for 100 letters. I dont see a reason why bitcoin shouldnt handle it the same way.\n* Is there a good reason to prefer transactions with many outputs?\nWhy? What happens when amazon decides to accept bitcoins? We might get flooded with transactions and might have filled our max blocks pretty fast. We would fail at the end maybe because a fork cant be made fast enough. So i think in order to allow adoption the max block size idea has to be dropped.\n* What do you think about this potential adoption hinderness?\n", "views": 482, "author": "SebastianJu Legendary Offline Activity: 2184 Merit: 1013 Legendary Escrow Service - Tip Jar in Profile ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmpty blocks and max block size\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-07-21 20:24:21", "content": "That's a good point.\nConsidering the \"1 tx blocks during stress tests\" found by Chinese miners (f2pool found 2 blocks in a row etc).

Before publishing I want to see what the community has for feedback so I can make adjustments from there. The purpose of the article is to introduce newcomers to Bitcoin, so it's meant to be clear and reader friendly. Let me know what you think. Be brutally honest because the harsher your feedback is, the better I'll be able to improve the article.\nWhen finished the article will be published on my website:\nwww.CryptoWorldwide.com\nwhere I'll be dedicating a page to newcomers to crypto. I appreciate you taking the time to look this over and hope you have a nice day!\nHere is a copy:\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin can be thought of as a response to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. It is a peer-to-peer decentralized digital currency, meaning there is no need for a trusted third-party to intermediate between transfers. For example, I can send bitcoins directly to you without any third-party interference. This power in the hands of individuals is unprecedented. For the first time in history, people all over the world can transfer value across the world without the need for permission. Further, governments and banks have no power to devalue the bitcoin currency because its based on mathematics, which only allow 21 million bitcoins to ever come into existence. Once the public realizes the implications of a currency that deflates over time, cannot be inflated, and can be transferred anywhere in the world without limits by governments, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will explode in value.\nBitcoin is relatively new, and so, it is still widely unknown and many of the people that have heard of Bitcoin, heard about it as some internet money that criminals used to buy drugs on the underground black market, The Silk Road. Others heard about Bitcoin as this internet money that disappeared from an exchange site called Mt.Gox. On those grounds, its easy to understand why people dismiss Bitcoin as a scam or internet funny money, but I would encourage you to look passed the controversy and learn about what makes Bitcoin a revolutionary financial instrument.\nBitcoin is a trust-less payment system. This is not to be confused with untrustworthy, trust-less simply means there is no need for trusting in a third party for storing or transferring your funds, i.e. banks. You can store your bitcoins in a digital wallet on your computer or phone, or store them offline on a paper wallet. You receive funds using a public address generated by your digital wallet or given to you when you create a paper wallet. Your public address can be shown to anyone and all that it can be used for is depositing bitcoins to your wallet and searching it on the blockchain to view transactions. More on the blockchain later. To spend your bitcoins you use whats called a private key which you should always keep stored safely and never share with others. A paper wallet is basically a generated public and private key that you store offline, so bitcoins sent to the address are on the Bitcoin network, but can only be spent when you use your private key. Thus, you are essentially your own bank with Bitcoin, and with that comes responsibility. For instance, if you lose your private key and have no way of finding it again, your bitcoins are lost forever, making that original maximum of 21 million bitcoins slightly lesser which slightly increases the value of the rest of Bitcoin users. Lost bitcoins can be considered a donation spread out evenly to the people who use Bitcoin.\nWhen you spend your bitcoins, the network has to confirm the transactions and because Bitcoin has no third party authority, miners carry out the task of confirming transactions to prevent double spending. A miner is someone using a computer to do work on the network in an attempt to find the solution to mathematical problems. The work done helps validate transactions across the network, but cost time and electricity for the miner, so if they successfully solve the math problem, they earn a reward. Miners originally earned 50 bitcoins for every solution their computer finds. The Bitcoin protocol halves this reward every 4 years, so now miners receive 25 bitcoins for finding the solution. At the time of writing this, 25 bitcoins are worth approximately $7000 USD. Now, before you get too excited, mining has come alone way since the early days of Bitcoin and now it takes super complex and expensive equipment to compete with other miners because the more miners there are mining bitcoin, the more difficult it becomes to find the solution to the math problems. However, by pooling resources together, smaller miners can earn profits with their mining equipment, so if you are interested, here is a link to how to get started with mining Bitcoin.\nhttps://www.bitcoinmining.com/getting-started/\nWhat was this blockchain thing mentioned earlier? The blockchain is a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions. This technology has implications far-reaching and beyond Bitcoin because now we can use the blockchain in business, banking, and government as a decentralized public accounting system that is entirely transparent. This could be used to track all of government spending, for example, which has been a problem for some time in that when power is concentrated in few peoples hands, incentive for corruption is strong enough to cause even seemingly good people to slip from time to time. Government corruption would all be exposed on the blockchain for the public to see, so the incentive for corruption is greatly diminished, if not, eradicated due to the consequences.\nHopefully now Ive at least sparked your attention to Bitcoin in a way that will foster continued learning and usage of this brilliant technology. Its uncertain where this technology will take us, but what is certain is that the financial revolution is here and whether you get left behind or not, Bitcoin is here to stay.\n", "views": 249, "author": "ScottSidders Newbie Offline Activity: 8 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI'm working on an introduction to Bitcoin article - feedback would be great!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-07-22 17:54:33"}, {"content": "This topic has been moved to\nTrashcan\n.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1131279.0\nRef spam.\n", "views": 185, "author": "EFS Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1862 Merit: 1183 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMOVED: top 10 best faucet as i know\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-07-22 13:47:27"}, {"content": "These recent stress tests have made it clear that if they want to, groups can attack bitcoin.

Established payment systems.\nnot for now, since bitcoin is not big enough to be any kind of threat to their systems. and still everybody uses their system or at least the big majority of people.\n2. People who want to highlight a weakness in btc and force a change (i.e., larger block sizes).\nactually i think this is the most probable group of people who are doing the attack right now and will be the motivated group in the future too.\n3. The supporters/investors of a competing alt coin.\nnot likely. because no altcoin is big enough to compete with bitcoin and also nobody would leave bitcoin for an altcoin. also nobody trusts altcoin market as much as they trust bitcoin (both are volatile but altcoin price has much higher risk)\n4. Bitcoin shorters.\ndoesn't seem likely but possible.\n5. Bored billionaires.\nif they are sadistic yes\n6. Exchanges. Any volatility increases the income for exchanges.\ni don't see how they can profit prom these attacks.\n#7. miners\nit is possible that miners are doing this to force increasing the fees in order to have more income especially since the block halving is near,\nGood addition. The thought of miners being able to gather enough of the fees from their own attack to keep it going (to drive up fees) had occurred to me.  Although I wasn't capable of doing the math to see if it was feasible. Cryddit worked it out the math in his \"Golden ratio attack\" thread, and it seemed doable but he's since deleted his post so I'm not sure if it was after all.\nAs for (6), many exchanges seem to have shady trading accounts on their own exchange, probably with an enormous bankroll, so if they thought they could drop the price with an attack, they could benefit from shorting (admittedly unlikely). I think a more likely scenario would be just using an attack to induce volatility. If there was a period of great stability in the price of bitcoin, this could hurt exchanges because volume would likely decrease. I haven't checked the stats, but I'd guess increased volatility is correlated strongly with increased volume. And, increased volume means more income for the exchanges from trading fees. Price swings are what keep the exchanges in business. I guess it would come down to how much price volatility an attack could induce.\n", "author": "monsanto Legendary Offline Activity: 1222 Merit: 1003 ..like bright metal on a sullen ground.

If you cut out all the transactions under 5 cents that's like 90% of the traffic.

The best part about this idea is its completely optional and dose not require a hard fork. But at the same time allows all users to vote on what the minium fee should be under heavy load.  As the mempool size increases the minimum fees necessary for propagation threw the network would rise accordingly and fall accordingly.  A simple sliding scale GUI could be added to all Full node clients for easy adjustments or be hard coded but configurable by the more tech savvy.

Fucking long confirmation time.\nThis is not a bitcoin problem it is a math problem.  Bitcoin (for good or bad) relies on math.  The hope was that wallets would use math to calculate TX fees.  Many do... apparently... yours does not.  You might want to reconsider your choice of wallet programs, or do the math yourself.  If you don't want to do the math, I would set your TX fee commiserate to your disdain for the math required.  Again... switching wallets, or complaining to the wallet maker may be the easiest answer.\nThe transaction fee is a statistical question... As long as the entire mempool can fit in one block (which it can as of right now), you can go all the way down to 1 sat/byte.\nThe minimum TX fee to stay on the network (as of today) is 1000 sat / 1000 bytes (or 1 sat/byte).\nIf your TX has old coins, it is possible that the priority is high enough (as of today 57,600,000) to stay on the network with no TX fee\nIf the mempool is larger than one block (1,000,000 bytes) then your TX will need to compete with other TX to get in a block.\nWhen transactions have to compete for blockspace the following sorting is used.\nThe transactions are sorted by priority\nThe highest priority (coin age) TX are selected until the block is 5% filled\nThe remaining transactions are sorted by satoshi/byte\nThose payint the highest satoshi/byte are selected for the remaining 95% of the block space\nThe rest of the TX are left into pool for the next sorting\nIf you studied statistics, this is straight forward problem to solve, but as others have stated about 76 times already... hard coding a fee value will not solve a statistical equation.  Best to get a wallet app that is mempool aware with sliding fees, or do the stats yourself if the mempool ever fills up again.\nThe sample data to solve this simple statistical problem by hand is conveniently provided\nhere\nif you scroll down and select \"\nRaw Data\n\"\nPS: Admins... forgive my double post... just get weary of explaining it.\n", "author": "d4n13 Full Member Offline Activity: 210 Merit: 101 Create Your Decentralized Life "}, {"date": "2015-07-20 21:24:16", "content": "well bitcoin has a great potencial and the speed of confirmations just make it be more secure harder to hack currently a hacker can get into bank accounts ,can cloned credit or debit cards ,bitcoin as i know cant be  .\n", "author": "knowhow Hero Member Offline Activity: 560 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-07-21 16:51:55", "content": "jbreher In case the attackers are ...\nYes, I understand all the implications. However, history hath shewn that central planning is never as effective as the invisible hand of the marketplace. Block space _is_ a limited resource. Let us compete freely for it. If the miners clog all the block space sending big transaction fee transfers to themselves, they may crowd out regular users' lower fee transactions. Net effect: no new fees will enter the system. They will not make money. They'll eventually realize it, and roll back to a more market-appropriate level.\nThere is no problem here.\nIf history has shown something then that the invisible hand of the marketplace is very dangerous to the whole. I agree that central planning works even worse. But the marketplace brings out results like banks that trade with enourmous bubbles. They proceed because the others do so too. At the end they crash and bring misfortune to the whole market.\nThe thing is, when miners find a way to earn more, then they will do. SPV mining for example. So when it's possible to get an advantage and you even harm bitcoin, then they might do it. When they made their nice stash and bitcoin is dead then they have their money already. And they can be sure that most others won't do it, in order to protect bitcoin.

When he raises his own fee then the attack isn't changed.\njbreher In case the attackers are a combination of big miners then they will earn from spamming because what they invest will come back and more on top. When the minimum fee would be raised then they would get what they want without having to pay for it. Though that only when really miners are spamming.\nI think your making the \"Golden Ratio\" argument, which was debunked...\nWhen spammers spam, all miners REVENUE go up, but only the spammers have the added EXPENSE of the spam.  Therefore they get less PROFIT.\nI don't see that calculation debunking the theory. I mean when the biggest chinese pools stay together then they can fund the operation cheaply.\nFor sure they will raise profits for all other miners too but they most probably will have the ability to create more cheap miners for a lower price than small miners and pools. The profits from spamming would be miniscule, the same goes for the profits the other pools get. But an advantage in cost of creation of miners can be rather big. So even when others earn more, it could mean that the big pools still get more back in new mining hardware.\nThough it looks like it weren't the miners, or they dropped their plan since the spamming stopped now.\nThe proof is that \"Spammer Bob\" makes\n1821\nBTC / day when spamming is off, but only makes\n1810\nBTC / day when spamming is on.\nYou may think that 11 BTC is no big deal for a miner, but the question remains... why would a miner engage in a behavior that reduces thier profit margin?\nI think that graphic includes some errors. First, with spam the fees are higher. Second, a potential mining corporation build out of all big chinese miners, could be more than 60%. So i think it's possible to increase mining profit with that.

Means 1 MB blocks might have a hard time reaching &gt;50% and might get orphaned often.\nWhen we now get 20MB blocks at one point, shouldnt the problem worsen then? I mean i can imagine the incentive to mine 1 transaction blocks will be even higher because the p2p speed wont keep up with that i think.\n* Wont this be a problem?\nMaybe a solution is to spread headers first, so some data identifying a found block. These headers are spread through all nodes in light time. The blocks follow later and can be verified. A one transaction block verified faster gets still orphaned when a 20 MB block gets verified later. That would ensure that empty blocks are not worth it.\nThere would need to be a timeout. Spreading faked headers wouldnt help because they would need to match a found block.\n* Will this be a solution?\nThen... when the spam happened, why did miners chose the huge transactions over many small ones with smaller fees? Shouldnt they chose many small transactions and shouldnt they be able to put more transactions with more fees into the block that way? Or only use the blocks that have the highest fee per satoshi. It shouldnt go after the fee per transaction because big transactions use much space and propagation time. It doesnt make so much sense to chose huge transactions that slow down a block and prevent more transactions being implemented only because they have a higher fee than small transactions. Though maybe its already handled that way.\n* How is it handled and if not so why?\nAnd what someone mentioned today... when we really want adoption we might need to drop the idea of a max block size completely and implement something like fee per output, since in fact each is its own transaction and should be treated like that. Since no post office allows you to bring 100 letters in a big box and send them out to 100 locations for 5 times the price for one letter. No, you either can chose the price of 5 times a letter to ship all letters to one location or you pay the price for 100 letters. I dont see a reason why bitcoin shouldnt handle it the same way.\n* Is there a good reason to prefer transactions with many outputs?\nWhy? What happens when amazon decides to accept bitcoins? We might get flooded with transactions and might have filled our max blocks pretty fast. We would fail at the end maybe because a fork cant be made fast enough. So i think in order to allow adoption the max block size idea has to be dropped.\n* What do you think about this potential adoption hinderness?\n", "views": 482, "author": "SebastianJu Legendary Offline Activity: 2184 Merit: 1013 Legendary Escrow Service - Tip Jar in Profile ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmpty blocks and max block size\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-07-21 20:24:21", "content": "That's a good point.\nConsidering the \"1 tx blocks during stress tests\" found by Chinese miners (f2pool found 2 blocks in a row etc).

All nodes spread the headers to others and set this headers on top of the queue.\nIn the meanwhile the big block from Miner b propagates slowly.\nMiner A finds a block. His block is very small. He spreads his header data. Nodes receive them and put them on position 2 in queue.\nThe block from miner A gets to all nodes. He gets verified completely and is valid. And the headers match that were previously sent.\nThe block from miner B gets in later. He gets verified and is valid. Headers match too.\nIn that situation the block from miner B would have been orphaned when his big block gets propagated to &gt;50% of the nodes later. But with the queue the nodes would know that that block actually was found earlier and the block from miner A would get orphaned instead.\nThat way the advantage to mine empty blocks will vanish and the network will work more healthy.

Before publishing I want to see what the community has for feedback so I can make adjustments from there. The purpose of the article is to introduce newcomers to Bitcoin, so it's meant to be clear and reader friendly. Let me know what you think. Be brutally honest because the harsher your feedback is, the better I'll be able to improve the article.\nWhen finished the article will be published on my website:\nwww.CryptoWorldwide.com\nwhere I'll be dedicating a page to newcomers to crypto. I appreciate you taking the time to look this over and hope you have a nice day!\nHere is a copy:\nWhat is Bitcoin?\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin can be thought of as a response to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. It is a peer-to-peer decentralized digital currency, meaning there is no need for a trusted third-party to intermediate between transfers. For example, I can send bitcoins directly to you without any third-party interference. This power in the hands of individuals is unprecedented. For the first time in history, people all over the world can transfer value across the world without the need for permission. Further, governments and banks have no power to devalue the bitcoin currency because its based on mathematics, which only allow 21 million bitcoins to ever come into existence. Once the public realizes the implications of a currency that deflates over time, cannot be inflated, and can be transferred anywhere in the world without limits by governments, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will explode in value.\nBitcoin is relatively new, and so, it is still widely unknown and many of the people that have heard of Bitcoin, heard about it as some internet money that criminals used to buy drugs on the underground black market, The Silk Road. Others heard about Bitcoin as this internet money that disappeared from an exchange site called Mt.Gox. On those grounds, its easy to understand why people dismiss Bitcoin as a scam or internet funny money, but I would encourage you to look passed the controversy and learn about what makes Bitcoin a revolutionary financial instrument.\nBitcoin is a trust-less payment system. This is not to be confused with untrustworthy, trust-less simply means there is no need for trusting in a third party for storing or transferring your funds, i.e. banks. You can store your bitcoins in a digital wallet on your computer or phone, or store them offline on a paper wallet. You receive funds using a public address generated by your digital wallet or given to you when you create a paper wallet. Your public address can be shown to anyone and all that it can be used for is depositing bitcoins to your wallet and searching it on the blockchain to view transactions. More on the blockchain later. To spend your bitcoins you use whats called a private key which you should always keep stored safely and never share with others. A paper wallet is basically a generated public and private key that you store offline, so bitcoins sent to the address are on the Bitcoin network, but can only be spent when you use your private key. Thus, you are essentially your own bank with Bitcoin, and with that comes responsibility. For instance, if you lose your private key and have no way of finding it again, your bitcoins are lost forever, making that original maximum of 21 million bitcoins slightly lesser which slightly increases the value of the rest of Bitcoin users. Lost bitcoins can be considered a donation spread out evenly to the people who use Bitcoin.\nWhen you spend your bitcoins, the network has to confirm the transactions and because Bitcoin has no third party authority, miners carry out the task of confirming transactions to prevent double spending. A miner is someone using a computer to do work on the network in an attempt to find the solution to mathematical problems. The work done helps validate transactions across the network, but cost time and electricity for the miner, so if they successfully solve the math problem, they earn a reward. Miners originally earned 50 bitcoins for every solution their computer finds. The Bitcoin protocol halves this reward every 4 years, so now miners receive 25 bitcoins for finding the solution. At the time of writing this, 25 bitcoins are worth approximately $7000 USD. Now, before you get too excited, mining has come alone way since the early days of Bitcoin and now it takes super complex and expensive equipment to compete with other miners because the more miners there are mining bitcoin, the more difficult it becomes to find the solution to the math problems. However, by pooling resources together, smaller miners can earn profits with their mining equipment, so if you are interested, here is a link to how to get started with mining Bitcoin.\nhttps://www.bitcoinmining.com/getting-started/\nWhat was this blockchain thing mentioned earlier? The blockchain is a public ledger that records all Bitcoin transactions. This technology has implications far-reaching and beyond Bitcoin because now we can use the blockchain in business, banking, and government as a decentralized public accounting system that is entirely transparent. This could be used to track all of government spending, for example, which has been a problem for some time in that when power is concentrated in few peoples hands, incentive for corruption is strong enough to cause even seemingly good people to slip from time to time. Government corruption would all be exposed on the blockchain for the public to see, so the incentive for corruption is greatly diminished, if not, eradicated due to the consequences.\nHopefully now Ive at least sparked your attention to Bitcoin in a way that will foster continued learning and usage of this brilliant technology. Its uncertain where this technology will take us, but what is certain is that the financial revolution is here and whether you get left behind or not, Bitcoin is here to stay.\n", "views": 249, "author": "ScottSidders Newbie Offline Activity: 8 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI'm working on an introduction to Bitcoin article - feedback would be great!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-07-22 17:54:33"}, {"content": "This topic has been moved to\nTrashcan\n.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1131279.0\nRef spam.\n", "views": 185, "author": "EFS Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1862 Merit: 1183 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMOVED: top 10 best faucet as i know\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-07-22 13:47:27"}, {"content": "These recent stress tests have made it clear that if they want to, groups can attack bitcoin.

Established payment systems.\nnot for now, since bitcoin is not big enough to be any kind of threat to their systems. and still everybody uses their system or at least the big majority of people.\n2. People who want to highlight a weakness in btc and force a change (i.e., larger block sizes).\nactually i think this is the most probable group of people who are doing the attack right now and will be the motivated group in the future too.\n3. The supporters/investors of a competing alt coin.\nnot likely. because no altcoin is big enough to compete with bitcoin and also nobody would leave bitcoin for an altcoin. also nobody trusts altcoin market as much as they trust bitcoin (both are volatile but altcoin price has much higher risk)\n4. Bitcoin shorters.\ndoesn't seem likely but possible.\n5. Bored billionaires.\nif they are sadistic yes\n6. Exchanges. Any volatility increases the income for exchanges.\ni don't see how they can profit prom these attacks.\n#7. miners\nit is possible that miners are doing this to force increasing the fees in order to have more income especially since the block halving is near,\nGood addition. The thought of miners being able to gather enough of the fees from their own attack to keep it going (to drive up fees) had occurred to me.  Although I wasn't capable of doing the math to see if it was feasible. Cryddit worked it out the math in his \"Golden ratio attack\" thread, and it seemed doable but he's since deleted his post so I'm not sure if it was after all.\nAs for (6), many exchanges seem to have shady trading accounts on their own exchange, probably with an enormous bankroll, so if they thought they could drop the price with an attack, they could benefit from shorting (admittedly unlikely). I think a more likely scenario would be just using an attack to induce volatility. If there was a period of great stability in the price of bitcoin, this could hurt exchanges because volume would likely decrease. I haven't checked the stats, but I'd guess increased volatility is correlated strongly with increased volume. And, increased volume means more income for the exchanges from trading fees. Price swings are what keep the exchanges in business. I guess it would come down to how much price volatility an attack could induce.\n", "author": "monsanto Legendary Offline Activity: 1222 Merit: 1003 ..like bright metal on a sullen ground.

The best part about this idea is its completely optional and dose not require a hard fork. But at the same time allows all users to vote on what the minium fee should be under heavy load.  As the mempool size increases the minimum fees necessary for propagation threw the network would rise accordingly and fall accordingly.  A simple sliding scale GUI could be added to all Full node clients for easy adjustments or be hard coded but configurable by the more tech savvy.

It would be ranked at the bottom of the free transaction anyway.\nIf you consider using alts, you might have faster confirmation but the adoption rate would be low and the price would be highly violatile. Bitcoin fees is only $0.03 and you would have a confirmation is a second or two.\n", "author": "ranochigo Legendary Offline Activity: 1540 Merit: 1083 "}, {"date": "2015-07-12 04:00:54", "content": "Bitcoin fees is only $0.03 and you would have a confirmation is a second or two.\nthat is the problem, it should be so but it is not. $0.03 is not enough these days, and TX is not confirmed with so small fee.\n", "author": "marecek666 Member Offline Activity: 186 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2015-07-12 04:04:13", "content": "Bitcoin fees is only $0.03 and you would have a confirmation is a second or two.\nthat is the problem, it should be so but it is not. $0.03 is not enough these days, and TX is not confirmed with so small fee.\nNah.

If we start implying artificial fees to fend off attacks, it can lead down a road where we might not want to go.\nA problem with a fixed btc fee is the price of bitcoin. If the price would drop an attack could happen as it would be cheaper. If the price rises then legitimate users would be affected negatively. Percentage fees lead to a similar problem with bitcoin losing its edge over the banking system.\nAfter all, wouldn't this problem be solved - at a cost of storage space - with increasing the block size?\ni agree with you bitcoin were made to take out those killing fees that banks takes for any thing we wanna pay or tranfer to others,if we raise it we will come to a point that bitcoin would loose all interest since use it or bank will cost the same,on those time bitcoin would be dead.\nI'm not worrying about this as long as the fee remains very low. We have free SEPA transfers within the EU, so it looks better than\nBTC\nbut a .10 cents transaction fee is not a deal breaker, considering the other advantages of\nBTC\n.\nsepa may be free but then they charge you fees when you exchange with money outside the euro zone or when you withdraw or for you credit card(monthly) and other random crap\nbitcoin from 10k to 100k satoshi can still work well and be very less expensive than fiat system\n", "author": "Amph Legendary Offline Activity: 1988 Merit: 1001 "}, {"date": "2015-07-20 08:05:47", "content": "I think this will get faucet users down.

Fucking long confirmation time.\nThis is my take on the situation as well. While I do see the need for transaction fees, I also see people complaining why bitcoin does not go more mainstream. While the .0005 fee may currently be 15 cents as someone pointed out, if I am going to use bitcoin for my everyday purchases that 15 cents will add up. If I make 30 small bitcoin transactions a day that would be an extra $4.50 just to use bitcoin. While I can see someone willing to pay $5.00 to move a $1,000+ transaction through a bit quicker, I cannot see a lot of people wanting to paying an extra $5 a day just to use bitcoin for their day-to-day activities.\n", "author": "Za1n Legendary Offline Activity: 952 Merit: 1007 "}, {"date": "2015-07-20 21:07:06", "content": "Why not just raise the transaction fee to .0005 per transaction??

Fucking long confirmation time.\nThis is not a bitcoin problem it is a math problem.  Bitcoin (for good or bad) relies on math.  The hope was that wallets would use math to calculate TX fees.  Many do... apparently... yours does not.  You might want to reconsider your choice of wallet programs, or do the math yourself.  If you don't want to do the math, I would set your TX fee commiserate to your disdain for the math required.  Again... switching wallets, or complaining to the wallet maker may be the easiest answer.\nThe transaction fee is a statistical question... As long as the entire mempool can fit in one block (which it can as of right now), you can go all the way down to 1 sat/byte.\nThe minimum TX fee to stay on the network (as of today) is 1000 sat / 1000 bytes (or 1 sat/byte).\nIf your TX has old coins, it is possible that the priority is high enough (as of today 57,600,000) to stay on the network with no TX fee\nIf the mempool is larger than one block (1,000,000 bytes) then your TX will need to compete with other TX to get in a block.\nWhen transactions have to compete for blockspace the following sorting is used.\nThe transactions are sorted by priority\nThe highest priority (coin age) TX are selected until the block is 5% filled\nThe remaining transactions are sorted by satoshi/byte\nThose payint the highest satoshi/byte are selected for the remaining 95% of the block space\nThe rest of the TX are left into pool for the next sorting\nIf you studied statistics, this is straight forward problem to solve, but as others have stated about 76 times already... hard coding a fee value will not solve a statistical equation.  Best to get a wallet app that is mempool aware with sliding fees, or do the stats yourself if the mempool ever fills up again.\nThe sample data to solve this simple statistical problem by hand is conveniently provided\nhere\nif you scroll down and select \"\nRaw Data\n\"\nPS: Admins... forgive my double post... just get weary of explaining it.\n", "author": "d4n13 Full Member Offline Activity: 210 Merit: 101 Create Your Decentralized Life "}, {"date": "2015-07-20 21:24:16", "content": "well bitcoin has a great potencial and the speed of confirmations just make it be more secure harder to hack currently a hacker can get into bank accounts ,can cloned credit or debit cards ,bitcoin as i know cant be  .\n", "author": "knowhow Hero Member Offline Activity: 560 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-07-21 16:51:55", "content": "jbreher In case the attackers are ...\nYes, I understand all the implications. However, history hath shewn that central planning is never as effective as the invisible hand of the marketplace. Block space _is_ a limited resource. Let us compete freely for it. If the miners clog all the block space sending big transaction fee transfers to themselves, they may crowd out regular users' lower fee transactions. Net effect: no new fees will enter the system. They will not make money. They'll eventually realize it, and roll back to a more market-appropriate level.\nThere is no problem here.\nIf history has shown something then that the invisible hand of the marketplace is very dangerous to the whole. I agree that central planning works even worse. But the marketplace brings out results like banks that trade with enourmous bubbles. They proceed because the others do so too. At the end they crash and bring misfortune to the whole market.\nThe thing is, when miners find a way to earn more, then they will do. SPV mining for example. So when it's possible to get an advantage and you even harm bitcoin, then they might do it. When they made their nice stash and bitcoin is dead then they have their money already.
