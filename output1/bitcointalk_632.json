If Bitcoin was revolutionary, poor people would have lots of it and rich people would trade their worldly goods for those coins.\nEarly adopters who paid a penny for a handful of bitcoins didn't lose much but gained a lot as the current price shows.\nSince Bitcoin is NOT being used as a major medium of exchange, its time hasn't come yet.\nWe don't know for sure where Bitcoin will go. Perhaps someone will find a bizarre way of breaking it tomorrow. Perhaps it will become the world trade currency someday.\nThe democratic thing about Bitcoin is, almost anybody who has a little cash can own a little of it. Bitcoin is simply a gamble as far as an investment goes. It isn't anything else as far as being a practical trade medium for poor people.\nIf a poor person is into investing, Bitcoin is as good as any other investment or better. Why? Because a poor person can get some from a faucet for free, or for a small amount of computer labor. He can save up $20, and buy a fraction of a bitcoin. Often, this is difficult for him to do with other kinds of investments.\nIf bitcoin really starts to take off, those who are hodling now, no matter how small the amount, stand to gain many times over in value. If Bitcoin is going to become a major currency in the world, now is the time to invest, since the past is gone. If Bitcoin goes down, we lose, just like any other investment.\nBitcoin gives poor people an easy chance... especially welfare people who are living high-on-the-hog off what Obama gives them.

If they just dissapear what will happen when all the bitcoins will be mined? Bitcoins can't be printed out like banknotes isn't it?\n)\nHi ChrisPop,\nIt is a common misconception that Bitcoins actually are stored in your wallet. The coins themselves are actually stored on the blockchain, and each wallet is the key to unlocking your personal stash of wealth. A perfect analogy is that we all belong to the first national bank of blockchain, and each one of us can get a safe deposit box (the wallet). If we want to get inside one of these safe deposit boxes, our wallets needs to generate a key (private key) in order to gain access.\nIf you delete your key (which is a part of the wallet) the coins are still located at the first national bank of blockchain. But its near impossible to get back into the safe deposit box.\nAs the topic's subject says my question is what happens to the bitcoins that were in deleted wallets? If they just dissapear what will happen when all the bitcoins will be mined? Bitcoins can't be printed out like banknotes isn't it?\n)\nhttp://en.bitcoinwiki.org/Bitcoin_Myths#Lost_coins_can.27t_be_replaced_and_this_is_bad\nThe whole \"everyone's coins goes up in value\" argument is silly and at this point a fallacy. In order for this to happen certain criteria need to be met (which non have). And even if these were to happen that doesnt mean everyone's coins naturally increase in value.\n1. All Bitcoins needs to be mined\n2. All bitcoins need to be actively traded (last I saw, only %30 of coins ever mined are actively traded and are just being recirculated)\nWithout either or both of these happening, there is near zero effect of Bitcoins value and someone burning their coins. If I had 500,000 Bitcoins today in cold storage, and I secretly burned them, no one would be the wiser therefore price still says the same.

Bitcoins can't be printed out like banknotes isn't it?\n)\nAbout the first question depends what kind of wallet you are talking about. If it is a bitcoin core wallet installed in your compute and you have saved your .dat file you can download a new wallet bitcoin core and replace the .dat file of the last one with the save from you. In this you will have all your bitcoins.\nIf the bitcoins will in an hard disk and you will destroy it without having any copy your bitcoins are gone forever. If the bitcoins are in a cold storage or in a deep cold storage or any other offline storage and you destroy physically those your bitcoins are again gone forever.\nIf your bitcoins are in an online wallet that depends from the option offered by every online wallet. I have bitcoin at coinbase for example. This online wallet offer protection from hacking (storing more than 97% of bitcoin offline) or even other protections. I have no knowledge about the other online wallets.\nIf there are bitcoin destroyed the overall number of those will be less. And yes bitcoin cannot be printed like the banknotes.\n", "author": "n2004al Legendary Offline Activity: 1050 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-11-09 09:38:28", "content": "the wallet will floating around and no one can own it\n1 year ago i just suddenly deleted my wallet (containt 0.01 BTC +) and i'm already trying any way to get it back, but nothing as a result\n", "author": "aubert Legendary Offline Activity: 1218 Merit: 1003 "}, {"date": "2015-11-09 11:28:44", "content": "It would be interested to know how many bitcoins exactly are lost.

But Bankers on Wall St. want cocaine, and cocaine can be purchased with Bitcoin.\nAre Cartels and Mafia groups using BTC?\nWhat's your point?\nYou'd like for Bitcoin to make everyone equal? To \"spread the wealth\"? Not happening.\nBitcoin is pure unadulterated crack capitalism cocaine. Of course bankers, traders and every one that is power hungry will love it.\nI think you just summarized his point. Bitcoin is no more noble, altruistic, or romantic than the current commodity market. Well, maybe a bit more romantic...\nBitcoin is special for its access and infrastructure...it's not saving the world.\nYes, I'd say that's what the point was. If Bitcoin was revolutionary, poor people would have lots of it and rich people would trade their worldly goods for those coins.\nEarly adopters who paid a penny for a handful of bitcoins didn't lose much but gained a lot as the current price shows.\nSince Bitcoin is NOT being used as a major medium of exchange, its time hasn't come yet.\nWe don't know for sure where Bitcoin will go. Perhaps someone will find a bizarre way of breaking it tomorrow. Perhaps it will become the world trade currency someday.\nThe democratic thing about Bitcoin is, almost anybody who has a little cash can own a little of it. Bitcoin is simply a gamble as far as an investment goes. It isn't anything else as far as being a practical trade medium for poor people.\nIf a poor person is into investing, Bitcoin is as good as any other investment or better. Why? Because a poor person can get some from a faucet for free, or for a small amount of computer labor. He can save up $20, and buy a fraction of a bitcoin. Often, this is difficult for him to do with other kinds of investments.\nIf bitcoin really starts to take off, those who are hodling now, no matter how small the amount, stand to gain many times over in value. If Bitcoin is going to become a major currency in the world, now is the time to invest, since the past is gone. If Bitcoin goes down, we lose, just like any other investment.\nBitcoin gives poor people an easy chance... especially welfare people who are living high-on-the-hog off what Obama gives them. Bitcoin is way more democratic for these people than they are for the rest of the country.\n", "author": "BADecker Legendary Online Activity: 1792 Merit: 1046 "}], "date": "2015-11-09 18:23:53"}, {"content": "Was thinking the other night about odd or interesting ways to generate keys and came up with this idea:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3re0au/use_any_picture_as_your_bitcoin_wallet_in_a_few/\nHere is a sample of what one looks like after the conversion.  Its a pretty popular bitcoin google search image.\nWhat do you guys think?\nEdited to add straight link to our blog:\nhttp://www.mycryptovault.net/blogs/news/75839620-create-a-bitcoin-wallet-from-a-picture\n", "views": 769, "author": "mycryptovault Full Member Offline Activity: 125 Merit: 100 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse any picture to create a Bitcoin wallet\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-11-04 03:32:30", "content": "does it work?\n", "author": "target Legendary Offline Activity: 1078 Merit: 1006 IGT-crypto - lifetime income from working exchange "}, {"date": "2015-11-04 03:40:29", "content": "Yeah, I have it working.  Tried to recreate using the same image and came up with the same 8x8 16 color image.  You just have to be careful and take your time when matching the colors in the image to the colors on the key.  And also be careful when entering the finished hex sequence into bitaddress.org so you dont have any typos.\n", "author": "mycryptovault Full Member Offline Activity: 125 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-11-04 06:04:41", "content": "I think it may be a bit risky... a bit change in contrast/saturation of the picture might give you a totally different address...

If they just dissapear what will happen when all the bitcoins will be mined? Bitcoins can't be printed out like banknotes isn't it?\n)\nHi ChrisPop,\nIt is a common misconception that Bitcoins actually are stored in your wallet. The coins themselves are actually stored on the blockchain, and each wallet is the key to unlocking your personal stash of wealth. A perfect analogy is that we all belong to the first national bank of blockchain, and each one of us can get a safe deposit box (the wallet). If we want to get inside one of these safe deposit boxes, our wallets needs to generate a key (private key) in order to gain access.\nIf you delete your key (which is a part of the wallet) the coins are still located at the first national bank of blockchain. But its near impossible to get back into the safe deposit box.\nAs the topic's subject says my question is what happens to the bitcoins that were in deleted wallets? If they just dissapear what will happen when all the bitcoins will be mined? Bitcoins can't be printed out like banknotes isn't it?\n)\nhttp://en.bitcoinwiki.org/Bitcoin_Myths#Lost_coins_can.27t_be_replaced_and_this_is_bad\nThe whole \"everyone's coins goes up in value\" argument is silly and at this point a fallacy. In order for this to happen certain criteria need to be met (which non have). And even if these were to happen that doesnt mean everyone's coins naturally increase in value.\n1. All Bitcoins needs to be mined\n2. All bitcoins need to be actively traded (last I saw, only %30 of coins ever mined are actively traded and are just being recirculated)\nWithout either or both of these happening, there is near zero effect of Bitcoins value and someone burning their coins. If I had 500,000 Bitcoins today in cold storage, and I secretly burned them, no one would be the wiser therefore price still says the same. That section needs to be removed from myths because it is a myth itself.\n", "author": "TheMage Hero Member Offline Activity: 812 Merit: 1000 Litecoin Association Director "}, {"date": "2015-11-09 01:37:31", "content": "The chance of lost bitcoins to be found is zero, but who knows maybe there is one day someone is so so so lucky to generate the same private key?

Bitcoins can't be printed out like banknotes isn't it?\n)\nAbout the first question depends what kind of wallet you are talking about. If it is a bitcoin core wallet installed in your compute and you have saved your .dat file you can download a new wallet bitcoin core and replace the .dat file of the last one with the save from you. In this you will have all your bitcoins.\nIf the bitcoins will in an hard disk and you will destroy it without having any copy your bitcoins are gone forever. If the bitcoins are in a cold storage or in a deep cold storage or any other offline storage and you destroy physically those your bitcoins are again gone forever.\nIf your bitcoins are in an online wallet that depends from the option offered by every online wallet. I have bitcoin at coinbase for example. This online wallet offer protection from hacking (storing more than 97% of bitcoin offline) or even other protections. I have no knowledge about the other online wallets.\nIf there are bitcoin destroyed the overall number of those will be less. And yes bitcoin cannot be printed like the banknotes.\n", "author": "n2004al Legendary Offline Activity: 1050 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-11-09 09:38:28", "content": "the wallet will floating around and no one can own it\n1 year ago i just suddenly deleted my wallet (containt 0.01 BTC +) and i'm already trying any way to get it back, but nothing as a result\n", "author": "aubert Legendary Offline Activity: 1218 Merit: 1003 "}, {"date": "2015-11-09 11:28:44", "content": "It would be interested to know how many bitcoins exactly are lost.

Moreover, people can easily use those address as cold storage and not have any transactions with it for extended period of time.\nIf those wallets are deleted and coins are sent to it, the coins will be gone forever. They can't be reclaimed without a fork but majority of the community probably wouldn't agree to this. To spend those coins, you definitely need the private key.
