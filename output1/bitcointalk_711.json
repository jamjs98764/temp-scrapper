IMHO there are too many scams/hacks out there.\nNo, not an early adopter. That's probably what saved me in the case of Mt. Gox. I got into bitcoin after thinking about the poor future and instability of fiat currencies around Christmas 2013. This led me to a little project of drawing up a list of characteristics that I thought \"good money\" should have, and I started grading the Dollar based on it.\nI'd seen occasional brief mentions of something called \"bitcoin\" in regular news media, and that was ticking up with the huge rise in price in late 2013. So one day a little light bulb came on in my brain, \"maybe this bitcoin thing is more along the lines of what I think good money should be like?\" I started investigating, satisfied myself that while not perfect it was objectively superior in most measures to the Dollar... and within two weeks I was starting to mine altcoins, and by end of January was impatiently awaiting my altcoin mining rig.\nI started signing up for exchanges in January, but fortunately (for me) by that point Gox was running into all kinds of trouble. As the leading exchange it was natural I'd want an account with them, but by early February 2014 there were so many red flags I can't imagine I'd ever have used them.\nThe other cases are just good fortune for me, combined with making decisions and acting promptly and decisively whenever I hear meaningful news of trouble related to bitcoin/altcoin services I use.

IMHO there are too many scams/hacks out there.\nNo, not an early adopter. That's probably what saved me in the case of Mt. Gox. I got into bitcoin after thinking about the poor future and instability of fiat currencies around Christmas 2013. This led me to a little project of drawing up a list of characteristics that I thought \"good money\" should have, and I started grading the Dollar based on it.\nI'd seen occasional brief mentions of something called \"bitcoin\" in regular news media, and that was ticking up with the huge rise in price in late 2013. So one day a little light bulb came on in my brain, \"maybe this bitcoin thing is more along the lines of what I think good money should be like?\" I started investigating, satisfied myself that while not perfect it was objectively superior in most measures to the Dollar... and within two weeks I was starting to mine altcoins, and by end of January was impatiently awaiting my altcoin mining rig.\nI started signing up for exchanges in January, but fortunately (for me) by that point Gox was running into all kinds of trouble. As the leading exchange it was natural I'd want an account with them, but by early February 2014 there were so many red flags I can't imagine I'd ever have used them.\nThe other cases are just good fortune for me, combined with making decisions and acting promptly and decisively whenever I hear meaningful news of trouble related to bitcoin/altcoin services I use.

Since Bitcoins are the scarce currency units which are required to power these applications, they are valuable.

As the relative price rises, more people in general become interested in owning XBT, and more merchants will want to receive XBT in exchange for goods and services. This is all because people (incorrectly) value XBT relative to fiat.\n", "author": "687_2 Full Member Offline Activity: 164 Merit: 100 "}], "date": "2015-03-21 16:52:04"}, {"content": "This topic has been moved to\nAltcoin Discussion\n.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1000374.0\n", "views": 385, "author": "Mitchell Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1904 Merit: 1181 Verified awesomeness ✔ ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMOVED: Do girls use dogecoin ?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-03-23 12:56:15"}, {"content": "http://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1992/12/msg00075.html\nAlso Ref a name for cryptographic currency - Cypherpunk Mailing List 1992 / Eli Brandt\nhttp://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1992/11/msg00029.html\n", "views": 479, "author": "row5_seat47 Full Member Offline Activity: 226 Merit: 100 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCan anyone think of a good kind of game that we could play?

We build geo-mobile social apps that run on Android and iPhone. One is Field Trip, which watches where you go and tells you about interesting stuff nearby. I work on Ingress, a massively multi-player map-based augmented reality game. It's a lot of fun to work on.\nI worked on Prediction Markets (AKA Idea Futures) for several years. It started as work on my own time, and evolved into a position with CommerceNet. I've been interested in these markets since the late 1980s, and have been participating (at the Foresight Exchange) since '92 or '93.\nI helped run a private real-money market in 1999, and wrote sofware to implement them from 2003 through 2009.\nI built Zocalo, an Open Source toolkit for Prediction Markets, hosted at sourceforge. From March, 2005 through July, 2006, I worked on this project in CommerceNet's research lab as Principal Investigator. After my stint at CommerceNet ended, I continued to pursue the project for a couple more years, working with groups at MIT and Chapman University.\nIn 2003, I worked on an implementation of Idea Futures in E. I used it to explore some of Robin Hanson's ideas on how to support conditional claims. It is probably mostly of interest to people who are interested in learning E, or are very interested in the details of Idea Futures. Early in 2004, while working as a contractor on an Extreme Programming project, and discovered the power of the Idea Java IDE. I started over building the present version of Zocalo in Java. This version focuses on integrating book orders with an automated market maker.\nI wonder if Chris left anything off his résumé.\n", "author": "Gleb Gamow Legendary Offline Activity: 1428 Merit: 1118 "}], "date": "2015-03-22 23:24:28"}, {"content": "I have included this in bitcoin discussion as using btc to purchase on coinstand is relevant to all btc users\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=999271.new#new\nUnder what circumstances would you consider using  coinstand to buy goods?\nNever\nwait and see\nIf they were substantially cheaper and the site was proven to deliver\nI may try it for a test\nCant wait want to use it now and for ever\nI would only buy with bitcoin\nedit.
