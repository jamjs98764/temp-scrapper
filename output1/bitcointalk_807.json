If i did not have an empty fiat wallet i would have waited till the next day.\nThey are also a bit of a pain to use in my experience. I have about 15 messages in verification codes from using this machine just twice, once i put in 200e and then it told me this was over the limit and my withdraw would be confirmed manually and to come back in 30-60mins once i had received a code via SMS, if in a hurry that could have been a real pain.\nI then tried to get 100e so i could buy a beer while waiting, it then refunded the BTC and gave me no 100e, i first had to receive and enter several verification codes and go through the same stupid menus several times.\nAlso when the machine took my 100e worth, it didn't come up on screen saying the transaction could not be processed and was being refunded once a SMS verification was recieved. I was just left standing waiting for my 100e to come out when sddely i got a SMS with a code, had someone who was fimiliar with the ATM not been at the location, the actually staff and myself were a bit clueless.\n", "author": "elasticband Legendary Offline Activity: 1036 Merit: 1000 Nighty Night Don't Let The Trolls Bite Nom Nom Nom "}, {"date": "2014-08-19 10:01:29", "content": "Thanks for replies.\nI conclude that good old VISA is still best\n", "author": "Bitcoin++ Full Member Offline Activity: 180 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-08-19 12:07:21", "content": "Thanks for replies.\nI conclude that good old VISA is still best\nbecause they are here since 50 years and bitcoin since 5 years.\n", "author": "LiteCoinGuy Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1001 In Satoshi I Trust "}], "date": "2014-08-19 08:21:42"}, {"content": "This topic has been moved to\nService Discussion\n.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=745490.0\n", "views": 599, "author": "grue Legendary Offline Activity: 2100 Merit: 1140 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMOVED: Funds just vanished at cex.io!!!!!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2014-08-19 02:24:15"}]}
