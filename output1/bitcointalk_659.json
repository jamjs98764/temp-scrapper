It's actually a good solution to give a choice to the free market wills.\nI would also prefer to see these changes implemented in Core. However that does not seem to be possible since some of the other core developers will not compromise and do not want to increase the block size limit at all. Therefore if we decide to stay with Core we will have one megabyte blocks forever.\nWe should not think that we must have the consensus of the core developers if that consensus becomes impossible to reach, since that is tantamount to centralization of power. The ability to hard fork in this way represents the check that we have against such power that a core development team could hold. This is part of what makes Bitcoin truly so decentralized. I do suggest that everyone reads Mike Hearn's article on why we should fork. Everyone should remember that this is not a popularity contest it does not matter who you like more or what you think of these people what matters is what is in the code itself. This is a crossroads in history and I hope that we collectively will make the right decision.

You have the option. What are you waiting for?\n*insert \"I can't buy groceries with bitcoins in my area\" here*\nyup this is the major cause and because of bitcoin price fluctuations many businesses instantly sell their bitcoins which is no good for bitcoin in the first place. Its like no use to accept bitcoin as it will literally make no effect until businesses start to hold btc.\nIf I was in the US I could live off of so much more than I do in Europe.\nThe fact that you can buy groceries at Whole Foods, Target, CVS, Kmart, etc. And you can use Bitcoin to pay for your food at Applebees, Chilis, Dominos, Burger King, Charleston's, Cracker Barrel, Cold Stone Creamery, IHOP, Logan's Roadhouse, Morton's, Papa Johns, Red Robin, Saltgrass, Steak n Shake, Texas Roadhouse, TGI Fridays, Tony Roma's would allow me to go quite a while without needing dollars.\nAnd since you can buy just about everything else online at Amazon and e-bay. There is very little you can't buy online. Movie tickets at AMC theaters, Fandango.\nHome Depot, Lowes, TJ Maxx, Cabela's, Sports Authority, Toys R Us, Best Buy, Dell...etc.\nThere is little excuse in the US to not get paid in bitcoins. Or at least part of your paycheck if your employer allows for direct deposit to different accounts.\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2015-08-19 09:00:49", "content": "What do you think would happen if employees got paid in BTC?

Do you think the price of BTC would change?

And when people start to use it by buying stuff and eventually it will be converted to fiat so price would go down.\nIts a complicated situation.\nLet alone farmers, how about about major markets, like Walmart, target, etc. If they started to accept and pay their employees in btc, It'd benefit both the BTC community and the markets itself.\nI dont think it will make much difference to price as the end result is btc is still being converted to fiat, we may see a rise upto 2000$-5000$ max as constantly btc will be converted to fiat to pay for resources. Most likely developed countries will be the first to become full bitcoin based but 3rd world countries would still take time. But you dont expect big businesses to hold btc which will likely cause more dumping. Its very complicated to imagine this scenario.\nDo you think that the BTC is useful only in developed countries?\nNot Useful, Its currently hard for people to understand that something so valuable which we cant even hold in our hand exist is some virtual world, Now try explaining that to a person who is uneducated who cant use internet or smartphones properly. those who think internet is world of scams etc. Thats why i said that, Btc is useful in only developed economies. You can hardly find a store in developing economies where you can buy daily things.\nIt will take time, Just like it took internet time to become a thing of everyday's use.\n", "author": "Thekool1s Legendary Offline Activity: 1008 Merit: 1039 PM for Social Media/Signature Campaign Management "}, {"date": "2015-08-19 09:03:50", "content": "I receive part of my salary in\nBTC\n.

It's actually a good solution to give a choice to the free market wills.\nI would also prefer to see these changes implemented in Core. However that does not seem to be possible since some of the other core developers will not compromise and do not want to increase the block size limit at all. Therefore if we decide to stay with Core we will have one megabyte blocks forever.\nWe should not think that we must have the consensus of the core developers if that consensus becomes impossible to reach, since that is tantamount to centralization of power. The ability to hard fork in this way represents the check that we have against such power that a core development team could hold. This is part of what makes Bitcoin truly so decentralized. I do suggest that everyone reads Mike Hearn's article on why we should fork. Everyone should remember that this is not a popularity contest it does not matter who you like more or what you think of these people what matters is what is in the code itself. This is a crossroads in history and I hope that we collectively will make the right decision.

Bitcoin is governed by economic incentives. Or else we would  not have bitcoin today.\nIf you're not happy with the way bitcoin goes, you can switch to any altcoins as you pleased.\nI urge any noobs to remember, what is Bitcoin's \"intrinsic\" value ?\nHint: there is no such thing as intrinsic value of bitcoin!\nIntrinsic value is a buzz word that nobody seems to understand.  People say gold has intrinsic value because it can be used for things but does anyone beleive that if everyone in the world decided to stop using gold except for industrial purposes that its current price would still be supported.  ofcourse not because the price of gold would crash to almost nothing. Intrisic value doesn't save you from price declines.All  instrinsic value  means is  the asset's value won't goto 0 because it has a use.\nWith bitcoin the instrinsic value is again its use case.  If people use bitcoin to transact it has value just like paper currency has value because people transact with it.  The backing of a government does not create the value of currency its the adoption by the public.  If you don;t believe me look at the zimbabwe dollar for proof of a government backed currency that has no value because its citizens did not transact in it.\nDing ding ding! and when the economic majority speaks up , open your ears wide open!\n", "author": "meono Full Member Offline Activity: 196 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-08-18 17:26:08", "content": "Do you think the NSA had a little say via Gavin in preparing the new code being introduced as XT?
