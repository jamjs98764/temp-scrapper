The \"hobby\" miners are less likely going to be monitoring electric costs and the price of bitcoin closely enough so that they know right away when costs of mining exceed the value of the bitcoin they are mining.\nLarge mining farms are going to be monitoring the price of bitcoin and the cost of mining (electricity) very closely. If their goal is to acquire a large amount of bitcoin then they will attempt to do so in the most efficient manner possible. This means they make an initial investment in miners in order to buy bitcoin at a discount (via their electric bill) in the future, however if they both want to acquire additional bitcoin and the cost to mine bitcoin exceeds the value of the bitcoin they are acquiring via mining they will simply buy additional bitcoin via an exchange at a similar rate they would be mining and turn off their miners. To continue to mine at a loss is not economically rational\nI agree, it is kind of backwards. Hobbies take money, everyone knows that. If I have 5 rigs and a refrigerator and heating and lights to pay electricity for, I'm not going to care about my electricity bill being higher, I'm just going to pay it. However if I'm running a warehouse full of electricity leeches, then all I'm gonna think about is how to pay the bill.\nThat being said, Franky is absolutely correct. If you cannot pay the electricity bill without selling bitcoin to do so, you should not be mining, mining is not for you.\n", "author": "fryarminer Hero Member Offline Activity: 658 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-12-21 07:17:52", "content": "large miners wont just give up... it will be the small hobbyists that turn off first.\nlarge miners want bitcoin and use FIAT to buy rigs and pay electric and then hoard coins. yet its the small hobbyists that care about the bitcoin price because they have to sell coins to recoup losses. to be honest i enjoy seeing these stupid hobbyists turn their rigs off.. after all they are not investing in bitcoin. they are selling coins to invest their freshly received fiat into electric companies.\nmining is not suppose to be quick mining to fuel a FIAT lifestyle. it suppose to be a way for people that want bitcoin to accumulate bitcoin. and those that want to accumulate bitcoin do not care about the price, as they know and are planning on the long term. and not caring about the daily/weekly costs\nHobbyists should turn off their miners and pay hosting facilities to mine for them. Less electricity would be used, along with forcing the mega farms to shut down.

As it is, with only a 9.7% supply inflation rate, it would only result in 8.85% less price for a single coin.\nOf course all of that assumes the same \"market cap\".  There is no reason that the \"market cap\" needs to stay the same. Bitcoin with the same (or higher) price per coin will simply have a higher \"market cap\".\nexample:\n1 billion cap for 10 million coins makes 1 coin 100$\n1 billion cap vor 15 million coins makes 1 coin 66,6$\n- that's the kind of decline in purchase power you are looking at (aka inflation)\nNo it isn't.  See above.\ncan't talk about alts here. If there is no better one then it needs to be launched but there are good coins already - all kinds of them. POW of course. Merged mined or not doesn't matter.\nLow inflation alt just needs to be pumped and then it's: byby bitcoin.\nHow would a coin come into existence without coming into existence?  Any alt will have to have inflation in order to exist.\nBitcoin is now inflationary. Deflationary later on (10years or more down the road if it manages to survive) but also only if people continue pouring cash into it.\nIncorrect.  Supply deflation does not require people to pour cash into it.  It only requires that less bitcoins be created than are lost.\nMaybe it's not even a \"currency\" but just a digital token?\nIt is definitly NOT a \"digital token\" since there is no \"token\" in bitcoin.  It is simply a ledger maintaining a list of requirements necessary to re-assign requirements to someone else. As to whether or not it is a \"currency\", that will depend on what each individual considers to be requirements for being a currency.\nWhere is the line to be drawn between an inflationary coin and a deflationary one? Can it be both at the same time?\nSince \"inflationary\" means increase in available supply, and \"deflationary\" means decrease in available supply, I don't think it is possible to be both at the same time.  That would defy simple logic.\nNeeds new topic.\nNo.  It really doesn't.\nI was talking about the inflation aspect.

There are still areas in Europe (not sure about US) with no (or very poor) mobile network coverage.\nbitshark\nseem to be ...\ni have not used\nbitshark\n...\nIt's 'bitspark'\nUsing 'shark' in any money/trust related business would be pretty bad marketing move\nwhere I lived before the negative slang for white people was shark.  white people are a little like sharks. they are big, fat, and wherever they go they destroy anything in there. (plus sharks are one of the few animals that are kind of white)\nas for the whole \"there are places with no internet\" thing. almost everywhere now has a signal even if it is a weak one.  if somebody doesn't have internet in the third world, it is probably because the cost of the service and/or hardware is just too high and they don't see how it will make their life better.  but in the next few years prices of hardware/service will go down quite a bit and utility will go up.  there will be herd boys in the middle of Mongolia in 5 years from now living with no electricity or running water, but they will be playing games on their old worn out smart phone charging it with an old worn out car battery.\ncharging the phone is actually the cheap part, less than a dollar a year in electricity, and that is an iphone 5 that is offering high end performance, not exactly a phone that was designed for the third world needs.\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5948075/how-much-energy-a-smartphone-uses-in-a-year-and-what-it-means-for-your-budget\n", "author": "The Chainmaker Member Offline Activity: 112 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-12-21 08:15:43", "content": "transferring money would still be necessary as the agents that receive cash fiat will need to deposit the funds to the bank to replenish their exchange account while the agents disbursing the cash will need to sell bitcoin and withdraw to their bank account in order to replenish their cash on hand.

At that time, the supply will become deflationary.\nyou obviously have no idea what you talk about.\nLast year was 10 million coins\nnext year will be 15 million coins\nYou need to work on your math a bit.  You are clearly struggling with it.\nExactly a year ago, there were a total of 12,136,675 BTC (not 10 million)\nNow there are a total of 13,614,125 BTC (not 15 million)\nThat's an annual inflation rate of a bit over 12%.\nA year from now there will be approximately 14,928,125 BTC\nThat's an annual inflation rate of 9.7%\nIn the middle of the year 2016, the block subsidy will be cut in half and the inflation rate will drop to less than 4%, and will continue to drop after that.\nThis means bitcoin with the same marketcap has nex year 50% less price for a single coin.\nNo.  Again your math is horrible.\nEven if you were correct with your 10 million and 15 million numbers (which you aren't), the same \"market cap\" would only result in 33% less price for a single coin. As it is, with only a 9.7% supply inflation rate, it would only result in 8.85% less price for a single coin.\nOf course all of that assumes the same \"market cap\".  There is no reason that the \"market cap\" needs to stay the same.

Deflationary later on (10years or more down the road if it manages to survive) but also only if people continue pouring cash into it.\nIncorrect.  Supply deflation does not require people to pour cash into it.  It only requires that less bitcoins be created than are lost.\nMaybe it's not even a \"currency\" but just a digital token?\nIt is definitly NOT a \"digital token\" since there is no \"token\" in bitcoin.  It is simply a ledger maintaining a list of requirements necessary to re-assign requirements to someone else. As to whether or not it is a \"currency\", that will depend on what each individual considers to be requirements for being a currency.\nWhere is the line to be drawn between an inflationary coin and a deflationary one?

Print them out(nor sure about tails, but last time I tried a live os, i had to go back in my common os to use the printer, but that should still be safe, since the wallets are Bip38-encrypted). Print them multiples times to make sure, you don't lose them all.\n9. Install Mycelium:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet\n(android)\nor BreadWallet (iOS)\n10. Buy Bitcoin and send it directly to your paper wallets.\n11. When you want to use your Bitcoin, scan your private key QR-code(type in your passphrase for bip38-decrypion with your smartphone-app, send the amount you want and send the change to another of your paper wallets.\nI think, that are pretty easy steps and you don't have to spend a satoshi to take them.\nDoes anybody see a flaw?\nI haven't really tried it out, so there might be something in it.\n", "views": 875, "author": "turvarya Hero Member Offline Activity: 714 Merit: 500 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat do you guys think about this method to safely store your Bitcoin?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-12-19 08:48:50", "content": "-snip-\nDoes anybody see a flaw?\nI haven't really tried it out, so there might be something in it.\nNot really...\nLets make some assumptions and see where we end up.

Specially, because that people wont be comfortabe with the voltatility. I am not either, which is why I buy just a small amount.\n", "author": "cheekychap Full Member Offline Activity: 182 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-12-19 08:09:44", "content": "One of the problems I see with bitcoin for every day use is that you have to have the funds always available to pay for things.

Why for instance do you think there are those horrible overdraft fees in banks? I love the fact that when I enter in an amount that's higher than what I have in my wallet there's a little message that comes up preventing me from doing so which just proves to me how badly the banks want to get me into debt and scam me.\nWhile I do agree we need to make Bitcoin easier to use and more accessible, I don't agree with the idea of making it 'convenient' in the way you seem to have put it. Credit and debt is exceptionally dangerous in the wrong hands and Bitcoin has a lot of built in measures that I've seen to prevent stupid people from using it in the ways we're used to.\nI'm not going to lie down and let another generation corrupt the next generations future with debt yet again, having a finite supply is not a problem, it's a security measure for the entire network to prevent fraudulent spending.\n", "author": "Lethn Legendary Offline Activity: 1540 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-12-19 15:47:23", "content": "I think your idea is great and you should look to run with it.
