Then I started using coinbase, and then multibit, paper wallets, blockchain.info etc.\nIn all these applications change addresses do not really apply since it is automated. I didn't learn about change addresses, and how spent/unspent inputs worked until later.\n", "author": "coinableS Legendary Offline Activity: 1078 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-04-08 03:35:01", "content": "All of the examples in that article are really bad ones.\n1 - this example talks about you not backing up your QT wallet file prior to your keypool being used up. This is something that people simply need to know to do. Although I personally do not like to use QT as a wallet as most of it's features cannot be used with it's GUI but rather it's command line interface. You should be generating a new address every time you are receiving a payment anyway, so once you receive 100 payments, then you would incur a similar issue.\n2 - This is a non-issue. In this example you do not actually lose any funds. You are simply looking at the incorrect address(s) on a block explorer to monitor your \"balance\" (I use the term 'balance' in quotes because bitcoin addresses do not actually have balances, however the concept of having the sum of unspent outputs is probably too complex for the author of this article even though it briefly touches on it). You would be in full control of all of your private keys, even your change addresses at all times if you use armory/electrum as long as you, in one way or another have access to the seed.\n3 - This is actually an example of very bad security practices, however we can ignore those. It also ignores the fact that\npaper wallets are generally less secure then encrypted wallets\n. Anyone who destroys a wallet file without first ensuring that you have a backup of all the private keys is just asking to lose access to their bitcoin. IMO it should be common sense to view any transaction on a major block explorer to confirm that the transaction was accepted by the network (especially with light clients), and anyone paying semi-close attention should notice that the output addresses are different then the input address (and that of your paper wallet).\n4 - This does not actually result in the loss of any funds. Also someone who is using QT in this way is using it incorrectly. If you need to use a single wallet across multiple computers/devices then you should use some kind of deterministic wallet when each private key is calculated from the seed - or a web wallet like blockchain.info that is somewhat centralized (although this is not recommended)\n5 - Multibit is really not the best program to import paper wallets into. I have also noticed that multibit tends to reuse the same change address, although I have not really looked into how it determines which change address to use. If change addresses are used properly then a new one should be used for each transaction, so since the paper wallet has been used in the past it should not be used again. Any wallet program is that allowing you to manually import private keys should give you the option (and recommendation) to \"sweep\" the inputs from any private key you import as opposed to actually importing them, even blockchain.info strongly recommends doing this.\n", "author": "ACCTseller Hero Member Offline Activity: 532 Merit: 500 no longer selling accounts "}, {"date": "2015-04-08 03:37:24", "content": "Nice article, thanks for the inside ill make sure to remember this just in case.\n", "author": "¡ndustrialcoinmagic Newbie Offline Activity: 16 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-04-08 03:55:02", "content": "Two simple concepts are all that are needed to prevent those problems:\nBack up up your wallet/seed.\nA Bitcoin address is not an account number.

Even then, customers had been waiting months for refunds since their orders were never fulfilled.\nBackground\nAt the time, Chikhi confirmed the claims of many customers that they had been waiting 1-2 months for refunds. When asked if his company had ever shipped a single mining rig, Chikhi said:\n\"I wont point out a specific post, but on our official forum, you will find, among many negative comments, customers actively discussing our equipment.\"\nChikhi pointed to this fact with a note of pride. More recent events, such as the sock puppetry that takes place in the forums of a certain other mining rig company, make even this claim suspect. It is just as likely that every single word of positive feedback was bought and paid for as it is that it was not. He also claimed that 99% of pre-orders had been cleared.\nCustomers Still Not Refunded Over A Year Later\nWhat follows is the story of just one burned customer of Bitmine. It is not actually the story of the first person to contact us about Bitmines most recent attempt to rope its customers in one final time, as that customer appeared unable to provide the documents and evidence specific to his case. His initial tip read:\n\"I purchased a Bitcoin machine from Bitmine AG on December 2, 2013. I have not gotten a machine or a refund as of today. I have sent over 50 emails as well as called the listed number have gotten no response. I have followed the bitcointalk forum on Bitmine and have seen the same thing repeatedly with other individuals with the same issue. [] Mr. Giorgio Massarotto is the owner of Bitmine and has scammed many people out of their money. They have also violated Swiss law by not paying proper taxes, he has emptied out their bitcoin wallet and is no longer anywhere to be found or heard from. The most frustrating part of the whole thing is none of the authorities in Switzerland will do anything about it. I have send countless correspondence to Federal police, local police, tax agencies, and cybercrime agencies and have not gotten any response. I would like to request an investigative news piece to be published to make as many people aware of this as much as possible. I would really appreciate your help on this matter. If there is any other information I can provide please feel free to contact me. Thank you in advance.\"\nHere is a picture of how the BitcoinTalk community feels about Giorgio Massarotto.

But the scammers are still around.  Making a bet that they're planning how to get you to \"invest\" your money in their next house in the Bahamas would be a pretty good investment.\nThat said?  An investment in mining could be a good idea if and only if you live in an area with heavily subsidized electrical utilities and/or can work out a sweetheart deal that gets you at least a 50% discount on electricity.  Some people are installing bitcoin miners as electric heaters in chilly areas, which gets them free electricity out of what homeowners or business owners are willing to pay for utility costs for heating. Otherwise, mining reliably loses money for two reasons.  First, because you're competing with people who do their mining in exactly those conditions.  And second, because at least a few of them are deliberately mining at a loss, either as an expensive way to speculate on a future price rise or as a premium they're willing to pay for the \"virgin coins\" they mine, which have no transaction history whatsoever and, if spent carefully, cannot be traced at all.\nUmmm, yeah, that probably means exactly what it sounds like it means if you're paying attention.  Like I said, you should be very careful about whom you do business with and what business you do, because the law is catching up and the sort of people who are likely to come to their attention are by no means gone.\nAn investment in Bitcoin startups would be best for the community as a whole, but for the investor it's a risky play.  Could be astoundingly lucrative depending on what happens, but.... I guess it depends on how much money your coalition has to invest in the *whole* portfolio that determines how much you can put on something risky.\nProbably the most reliably profitable, least risky, and lowest-margin bitcoin business right now would be a currency exchange.  Right now there are dozens of players trying to be currency exchanges - and federal money transmitter laws are removing many of them from the business, so if you can navigate that legal maze the competition is getting weeded out for you as we speak.  But on that score you'd have to act pretty fast, because there are already some big players moving.  It's not just the Winklevii either; there are some sharper, faster-moving businessmen in some of those startups.\nSecond on the list is people who supply payment services;  Joe merchant wants to accept Bitcoin at his truck stop bar &amp; grill, but doesn't want the bother and complexity of managing it himself.  Payment services guy steps in and sets him up with the appropriate secured equipment, shows him how to use it, processes payments for him, etc.  Bitcoin here is a competitive advantage over Visa etc, because the per-transaction costs are lower.  That is, the bitcoin-to-bitcoin transaction costs are lower.  If you're paying an exchange to convert to and from other forms of money, you'll want to aggregate bitcoins to make fewer and smaller tx at the exchanges.  Or, you know, do vertical integration and be the exchange as well as the payment services provider.\n", "author": "Cryddit Legendary Offline Activity: 868 Merit: 1026 "}, {"date": "2015-04-03 23:28:36", "content": "The best tip is hold your coins!\nDon't invest in hardware!\nDon't invest in \"cloud mining\".\nDon't invest in securities!\nDon't invest in altcoins!\n", "author": "A10010 Jr. Member Offline Activity: 31 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-04-04 00:23:48", "content": "The best tip is hold your coins!\nDon't invest in hardware!\nDon't invest in \"cloud mining\".\nDon't invest in securities!\nDon't invest in altcoins!\nI do not think that  your point number 1 is valid strategy for a company.

There are a lot of scams in the mining world as many manufacturers either do not deliver at all or are horribly delayed in delivering their miners. Even if you do receive hardware and on time, the difficulty is more or less expected to rise at a quick enough pace so that it is unlikely that you will achieve a return on your investment after considering electric costs.\nCloud mining?\nThis has similar problems as buying mining hardware, however almost all cloud mining companies are scams. The ones that are not outright scams eventually end up scamming. In addition to the issue of the difficulty rising, you will have additional expenses when \"cloud mining\" because an additional company will need to earn a profit\nBitcoin startups?\nThis would probably be the best of your options. Although you will need to ensure that you are not investing in a scam. The good thing about investing in a startup that is already somewhat established is that the startup will likely benefit/profit in the event that crypto currencies are successful in general - they don't need bitcoin specifically to be successful; this is important because although bitcoin is so far superior to other alt/shit coins it does not mean that a supperior coin will not come at one point in time. Two companies that come to mind are coinbase and circle.\nAnother option would be to invest in bitcoin ATM's (this has been mentioned once or twice already). When someone would buy or sell bitcoin at your ATM they would pay a slightly above or below (depending if they are buying or selling bitcoin to you) market price and you would get to keep the difference between the market price and the rate your customer pays/receives. You would probably want to keep both bitcoin and fiat at a major exchange in order to hedge transactions done at your ATM and can likely have it setup so that when someone buys bitcoin from your ATM that the bitcoin is automatically sold on the exchange so you do not have exchange rate risk\nIf I qualify for your bounty then my address is 1Dgehu7u9te73wpQyE4jwqv68v7PQXMi5W\n", "author": "fonenumba Full Member Offline Activity: 413 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-04-04 04:58:38", "content": "Buy and hold, the best strategy beats everything else in fiat world (because of inflation), and it is even better in bitcoin world (fiat super inflation against bitcoin)\n", "author": "johnyj Legendary Offline Activity: 1848 Merit: 1000 Beyond Imagination "}, {"date": "2015-04-04 05:38:42", "content": "SuperNET is a movement of volunteer participants who will donate their time and money to support a radical new cryptocurrency initiative.

This activity will be facilitated by traditional cryptocurrency exchanges.)\nThe idea behind SuperNET is simple but powerful: to create a mutually beneficial network of coins that offer real innovation. It will take the form of a basket of key cryptocurrencies and revenue-generating services.\nSuperNET plans to achieve its aims by acquiring a significant (10 percent market cap) stake in participating coins with promising technology, adding further value by cross-marketing their features and providing additional services.\nThe features of each core coin will be made available to all of the others through a GUI embedded in the wallets of participating coins. SuperNET participants and core coin communities may potentially be rewarded by goodwill payments similar to dividends from a series of integrated linked services, as well as through any possible appreciation in value to the core cryptocurrencies brought about by the collaboration and sharing of features and services. Only coins that bring one or more unique features to the network will be added to the core, though any other cryptocurrency can benefit from these features on a third-party basis. (For example, Litecoin would not be eligible for addition to SuperNET. However, it would still have access to Teleport, InstantDEX and other services.\nUltimately, it is hoped that SuperNET will attract greater talent and wealth into cryptocurrency from fiat, strengthening cryptocurrency overall by rewarding innovation, talent and commitment. SuperNET is not designed to replace Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, but to enable cryptocurrency to compete more effectively with the fiat economy. This is the cause to which participants commit themselves.\nhttp://www.supernet.org/\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=762346.0\n", "author": "Valta Crypto Sr. Member Offline Activity: 243 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-04-04 05:57:42", "content": "With that size of funding maybe you can consider setting up a bitcoin exchanger site or a crypto currency trading platform.

This is something that people simply need to know to do. Although I personally do not like to use QT as a wallet as most of it's features cannot be used with it's GUI but rather it's command line interface. You should be generating a new address every time you are receiving a payment anyway, so once you receive 100 payments, then you would incur a similar issue.\n2 - This is a non-issue. In this example you do not actually lose any funds. You are simply looking at the incorrect address(s) on a block explorer to monitor your \"balance\" (I use the term 'balance' in quotes because bitcoin addresses do not actually have balances, however the concept of having the sum of unspent outputs is probably too complex for the author of this article even though it briefly touches on it). You would be in full control of all of your private keys, even your change addresses at all times if you use armory/electrum as long as you, in one way or another have access to the seed.\n3 - This is actually an example of very bad security practices, however we can ignore those. It also ignores the fact that\npaper wallets are generally less secure then encrypted wallets\n. Anyone who destroys a wallet file without first ensuring that you have a backup of all the private keys is just asking to lose access to their bitcoin. IMO it should be common sense to view any transaction on a major block explorer to confirm that the transaction was accepted by the network (especially with light clients), and anyone paying semi-close attention should notice that the output addresses are different then the input address (and that of your paper wallet).\n4 - This does not actually result in the loss of any funds. Also someone who is using QT in this way is using it incorrectly. If you need to use a single wallet across multiple computers/devices then you should use some kind of deterministic wallet when each private key is calculated from the seed - or a web wallet like blockchain.info that is somewhat centralized (although this is not recommended)\n5 - Multibit is really not the best program to import paper wallets into. I have also noticed that multibit tends to reuse the same change address, although I have not really looked into how it determines which change address to use. If change addresses are used properly then a new one should be used for each transaction, so since the paper wallet has been used in the past it should not be used again. Any wallet program is that allowing you to manually import private keys should give you the option (and recommendation) to \"sweep\" the inputs from any private key you import as opposed to actually importing them, even blockchain.info strongly recommends doing this.\n", "author": "ACCTseller Hero Member Offline Activity: 532 Merit: 500 no longer selling accounts "}, {"date": "2015-04-08 03:37:24", "content": "Nice article, thanks for the inside ill make sure to remember this just in case.\n", "author": "¡ndustrialcoinmagic Newbie Offline Activity: 16 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-04-08 03:55:02", "content": "Two simple concepts are all that are needed to prevent those problems:\nBack up up your wallet/seed.\nA Bitcoin address is not an account number.

Even then, customers had been waiting months for refunds since their orders were never fulfilled.\nBackground\nAt the time, Chikhi confirmed the claims of many customers that they had been waiting 1-2 months for refunds. When asked if his company had ever shipped a single mining rig, Chikhi said:\n\"I wont point out a specific post, but on our official forum, you will find, among many negative comments, customers actively discussing our equipment.\"\nChikhi pointed to this fact with a note of pride. More recent events, such as the sock puppetry that takes place in the forums of a certain other mining rig company, make even this claim suspect. It is just as likely that every single word of positive feedback was bought and paid for as it is that it was not. He also claimed that 99% of pre-orders had been cleared.\nCustomers Still Not Refunded Over A Year Later\nWhat follows is the story of just one burned customer of Bitmine. It is not actually the story of the first person to contact us about Bitmines most recent attempt to rope its customers in one final time, as that customer appeared unable to provide the documents and evidence specific to his case. His initial tip read:\n\"I purchased a Bitcoin machine from Bitmine AG on December 2, 2013. I have not gotten a machine or a refund as of today. I have sent over 50 emails as well as called the listed number have gotten no response. I have followed the bitcointalk forum on Bitmine and have seen the same thing repeatedly with other individuals with the same issue. [] Mr. Giorgio Massarotto is the owner of Bitmine and has scammed many people out of their money. They have also violated Swiss law by not paying proper taxes, he has emptied out their bitcoin wallet and is no longer anywhere to be found or heard from. The most frustrating part of the whole thing is none of the authorities in Switzerland will do anything about it. I have send countless correspondence to Federal police, local police, tax agencies, and cybercrime agencies and have not gotten any response. I would like to request an investigative news piece to be published to make as many people aware of this as much as possible. I would really appreciate your help on this matter. If there is any other information I can provide please feel free to contact me. Thank you in advance.\"\nHere is a picture of how the BitcoinTalk community feels about Giorgio Massarotto.

But the scammers are still around.  Making a bet that they're planning how to get you to \"invest\" your money in their next house in the Bahamas would be a pretty good investment.\nThat said?  An investment in mining could be a good idea if and only if you live in an area with heavily subsidized electrical utilities and/or can work out a sweetheart deal that gets you at least a 50% discount on electricity.  Some people are installing bitcoin miners as electric heaters in chilly areas, which gets them free electricity out of what homeowners or business owners are willing to pay for utility costs for heating. Otherwise, mining reliably loses money for two reasons.  First, because you're competing with people who do their mining in exactly those conditions.  And second, because at least a few of them are deliberately mining at a loss, either as an expensive way to speculate on a future price rise or as a premium they're willing to pay for the \"virgin coins\" they mine, which have no transaction history whatsoever and, if spent carefully, cannot be traced at all.\nUmmm, yeah, that probably means exactly what it sounds like it means if you're paying attention.  Like I said, you should be very careful about whom you do business with and what business you do, because the law is catching up and the sort of people who are likely to come to their attention are by no means gone.\nAn investment in Bitcoin startups would be best for the community as a whole, but for the investor it's a risky play.  Could be astoundingly lucrative depending on what happens, but.... I guess it depends on how much money your coalition has to invest in the *whole* portfolio that determines how much you can put on something risky.\nProbably the most reliably profitable, least risky, and lowest-margin bitcoin business right now would be a currency exchange.  Right now there are dozens of players trying to be currency exchanges - and federal money transmitter laws are removing many of them from the business, so if you can navigate that legal maze the competition is getting weeded out for you as we speak.  But on that score you'd have to act pretty fast, because there are already some big players moving.  It's not just the Winklevii either; there are some sharper, faster-moving businessmen in some of those startups.\nSecond on the list is people who supply payment services;  Joe merchant wants to accept Bitcoin at his truck stop bar &amp; grill, but doesn't want the bother and complexity of managing it himself.  Payment services guy steps in and sets him up with the appropriate secured equipment, shows him how to use it, processes payments for him, etc.  Bitcoin here is a competitive advantage over Visa etc, because the per-transaction costs are lower.  That is, the bitcoin-to-bitcoin transaction costs are lower.  If you're paying an exchange to convert to and from other forms of money, you'll want to aggregate bitcoins to make fewer and smaller tx at the exchanges.  Or, you know, do vertical integration and be the exchange as well as the payment services provider.\n", "author": "Cryddit Legendary Offline Activity: 868 Merit: 1026 "}, {"date": "2015-04-03 23:28:36", "content": "The best tip is hold your coins!\nDon't invest in hardware!\nDon't invest in \"cloud mining\".\nDon't invest in securities!\nDon't invest in altcoins!\n", "author": "A10010 Jr. Member Offline Activity: 31 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-04-04 00:23:48", "content": "The best tip is hold your coins!\nDon't invest in hardware!\nDon't invest in \"cloud mining\".\nDon't invest in securities!\nDon't invest in altcoins!\nI do not think that  your point number 1 is valid strategy for a company.

There are a lot of scams in the mining world as many manufacturers either do not deliver at all or are horribly delayed in delivering their miners. Even if you do receive hardware and on time, the difficulty is more or less expected to rise at a quick enough pace so that it is unlikely that you will achieve a return on your investment after considering electric costs.\nCloud mining?\nThis has similar problems as buying mining hardware, however almost all cloud mining companies are scams. The ones that are not outright scams eventually end up scamming. In addition to the issue of the difficulty rising, you will have additional expenses when \"cloud mining\" because an additional company will need to earn a profit\nBitcoin startups?\nThis would probably be the best of your options. Although you will need to ensure that you are not investing in a scam. The good thing about investing in a startup that is already somewhat established is that the startup will likely benefit/profit in the event that crypto currencies are successful in general - they don't need bitcoin specifically to be successful; this is important because although bitcoin is so far superior to other alt/shit coins it does not mean that a supperior coin will not come at one point in time. Two companies that come to mind are coinbase and circle.\nAnother option would be to invest in bitcoin ATM's (this has been mentioned once or twice already). When someone would buy or sell bitcoin at your ATM they would pay a slightly above or below (depending if they are buying or selling bitcoin to you) market price and you would get to keep the difference between the market price and the rate your customer pays/receives. You would probably want to keep both bitcoin and fiat at a major exchange in order to hedge transactions done at your ATM and can likely have it setup so that when someone buys bitcoin from your ATM that the bitcoin is automatically sold on the exchange so you do not have exchange rate risk\nIf I qualify for your bounty then my address is 1Dgehu7u9te73wpQyE4jwqv68v7PQXMi5W\n", "author": "fonenumba Full Member Offline Activity: 413 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-04-04 04:58:38", "content": "Buy and hold, the best strategy beats everything else in fiat world (because of inflation), and it is even better in bitcoin world (fiat super inflation against bitcoin)\n", "author": "johnyj Legendary Offline Activity: 1848 Merit: 1000 Beyond Imagination "}, {"date": "2015-04-04 05:38:42", "content": "SuperNET is a movement of volunteer participants who will donate their time and money to support a radical new cryptocurrency initiative. SuperNET itself is not a cryptocurrency. Participation in SuperNET and distribution of any revenues it may generate in the future will be denoted by ownership of cryptoTokens given in exchange for donations. (Membership may later be passed on by participants to others, in return for a further donation to the original participants if desired. This activity will be facilitated by traditional cryptocurrency exchanges.)\nThe idea behind SuperNET is simple but powerful: to create a mutually beneficial network of coins that offer real innovation. It will take the form of a basket of key cryptocurrencies and revenue-generating services.\nSuperNET plans to achieve its aims by acquiring a significant (10 percent market cap) stake in participating coins with promising technology, adding further value by cross-marketing their features and providing additional services.\nThe features of each core coin will be made available to all of the others through a GUI embedded in the wallets of participating coins. SuperNET participants and core coin communities may potentially be rewarded by goodwill payments similar to dividends from a series of integrated linked services, as well as through any possible appreciation in value to the core cryptocurrencies brought about by the collaboration and sharing of features and services. Only coins that bring one or more unique features to the network will be added to the core, though any other cryptocurrency can benefit from these features on a third-party basis. (For example, Litecoin would not be eligible for addition to SuperNET. However, it would still have access to Teleport, InstantDEX and other services.\nUltimately, it is hoped that SuperNET will attract greater talent and wealth into cryptocurrency from fiat, strengthening cryptocurrency overall by rewarding innovation, talent and commitment. SuperNET is not designed to replace Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, but to enable cryptocurrency to compete more effectively with the fiat economy. This is the cause to which participants commit themselves.\nhttp://www.supernet.org/\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=762346.0\n", "author": "Valta Crypto Sr. Member Offline Activity: 243 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-04-04 05:57:42", "content": "With that size of funding maybe you can consider setting up a bitcoin exchanger site or a crypto currency trading platform.
