Like usually, we have a problem that is essentially based on a controversial issue. If it wasn't controversial there would be no argument as none of us here is really stupid. We all have common sense. However, as soon as things are no longer black and white all sorts of disputes are bound to happen. Homosexual marriage or not? Sex with animals or not? Emoticons or not?\nRegarding the latter, emoticons are the lesser evil in this highly pragmatic way of communication, where memes dominate the internet space and one must state their sentence with the minimal number of bytes in order to prevent people from answering with\nTLDR\n. So what's the greater evil? --- Ambiguity. Without the help of emoticons we are doomed to have our intent misinterpreted. By the way, if you think that emoticons are only used to express sarcasm then you're a step away from malignant paranoia. It's the same as assuming that all people are evil and want to harm you.\nThat said, I remain at my stance that even though emoticons introduce a certain degree of degeneration from the literati's point of view, they do more good than evil. They give you a hint what the other person is communicating to you. Textual language alone has never been the perfect way of communication. Thus, we must compensate.

Just hope you don't get an anal probe on your first encounter\nshould it ever happen.\nThis article might be important for you:\nhttp://www.hollabackhealth.com/2010/12/five-reasons-to-stop-using-emoticons/\nInteresting text but I disagree with the most of its contents as it stands for a rather subjective point of view. Like usually, we have a problem that is essentially based on a controversial issue. If it wasn't controversial there would be no argument as none of us here is really stupid. We all have common sense. However, as soon as things are no longer black and white all sorts of disputes are bound to happen. Homosexual marriage or not? Sex with animals or not? Emoticons or not?\nRegarding the latter, emoticons are the lesser evil in this highly pragmatic way of communication, where memes dominate the internet space and one must state their sentence with the minimal number of bytes in order to prevent people from answering with\nTLDR\n. So what's the greater evil? --- Ambiguity. Without the help of emoticons we are doomed to have our intent misinterpreted. By the way, if you think that emoticons are only used to express sarcasm then you're a step away from malignant paranoia. It's the same as assuming that all people are evil and want to harm you.\nThat said, I remain at my stance that even though emoticons introduce a certain degree of degeneration from the literati's point of view, they do more good than evil. They give you a hint what the other person is communicating to you. Textual language alone has never been the perfect way of communication. Thus, we must compensate. Ever heard of the adage \"\na picture is worth a thousand words\n\"? Sure you have. Now isn't an emoticon a picture?\n", "author": "Hyena Legendary Offline Activity: 1960 Merit: 1002 "}, {"date": "2014-10-26 23:58:46", "content": "@R2D2\nHave you been molested by an emoticon when you were a child?\n", "author": "Goldmundo Jr. Member Offline Activity: 46 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2014-10-27 00:00:37", "content": "@R2D2\nHave you been molested by an emoticon when you were a child?\nWHAT?

In the given example it would mean that I was actually meaning to say \"\nJust hope you get an anal probe on your first encounter\n\". That sentence does not make any sense because why would you yourself hope that you would get an anal probe? Now if you accuse me of secretly hoping that you would get an anal probe then you are just assuming that I am an evil person who wants bad things happening to you. The reality is that I don't give a shit if the aliens who might abduct you give you an anal probe or not. However, anal probe is sort of an alien-conspiracy-theorist-meme, so I injected the\nsmiley to express how it makes me chuckle to even think about someone getting an anal probe from the grey aliens. It's sort of like a rape joke so I admit that I shouldn't be laughing but then again, we have all sorts of people.

The trick is that the Bitcoin ATMs arenât just Bitcoin ATMs. Theyâre actually conventional ATMs owned by the âNational Creditâ Bank of Ukraine which have had their software updated to support BTC transactions. By partnering with a popular bank and leveraging existing infrastructure, BTCU.biz was able to leapfrog ahead of many of the dedicated Bitcoin ATM companies, without having to personally raise the capital necessary to put that many machines on street corners.\nSo all they did was a software change? Seems a bit too easy. Almost like cheating.\nAlso it's weird to see that a bank was involved in this. I was under the impression that banks hate Bitcoin. Maybe things are a bit different there.\nI think the story is missing a major point: What is the fee of those ATMs?\nFrom the same website as above:\nThe machines sell BTC at a rate of $693 per Bitcoin, $45 above the current CoinMarketCap price of $648, a transaction fee of about 7%, which is on the high side, but may well be worth it for the convenience.\n", "author": "Kiloday Newbie Offline Activity: 14 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2014-07-12 21:39:58", "content": "This is a smart approach that should be attempted wherever the ATM software allows it.\nI know my bank has a separate key for buying stamps.
