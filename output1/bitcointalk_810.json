One could relay info via a flyer to Google \"Burning Man Bitcoin\" without quotes, and the main entity that would make this possible would have done SEO to some site to thereby profit somewhat down the road.\nThe camp could be named \"Free Bitcoins\" and, of course, man the camp with\nBitcoin Gone Wild\ngirls. To make it more interesting, since most all the other women at Burning Man will be nude or partially nude, our girls will be donning furs and dancing onto coffee tables.\nSometimes I have to ask myself, \"Bruno, where do you come up with this shit?\"\nSeriously, this idea is not outside the realm of possibility.

Thanks for volunteering me Charlie\nSuch a trip will be absolutely fantastic under the following conditions:\n1) First and foremost, the purpose has to be to go with bitcoiners as a social and networking and ideating activity. We'll be able to talk bitcoin all day long among ourselves and I'm sure some great work would come out of it. BUT - we will not (and should not) be able to \"sell\" or promote bitcoin at Burning Man in any visible way. If it comes up in conversation with outsiders, that's great, but we can't be there to evangelize. So to the extent that it's partly a business trip, the business would be primarily limited to internally within our group, not externally toward other burners. The event is explicitly \"money free\" and \"promotion free\"... and if we're promoting money then we FAIL doubly\nWith that said, many burners would be interested in a counter-culture monetary system - so hopefully lots of organic conversations could happen.\n2) There's actually an issue of ticketing this year... basically the event has gotten so large that there are not enough tickets. Because the operators don't understand how price mechanisms work, they thought it'd be better to distribute tickets on a lottery system than by raising prices to curb demand. Any free-marketer would be able to predict the outcome - shortages! I have no idea how to get tickets this year, and it might be impossible to do in any coordinated way for a group of us. So, this might be a problem :/\n3) Burning Man is absolutely wild and awesome and interesting (just like Bitcoin). I can think of no better way to spend a week with fellow bitcoiners. But, it's intense, and requires lots of planning. Cannot be done last-minute. Requires commitment and dedication.\n4) A nice RV is mandatory... fuck tents in the hot sun.

Thanks for volunteering me Charlie\nSuch a trip will be absolutely fantastic under the following conditions:\n1) First and foremost, the purpose has to be to go with bitcoiners as a social and networking and ideating activity. We'll be able to talk bitcoin all day long among ourselves and I'm sure some great work would come out of it. BUT - we will not (and should not) be able to \"sell\" or promote bitcoin at Burning Man in any visible way. If it comes up in conversation with outsiders, that's great, but we can't be there to evangelize. So to the extent that it's partly a business trip, the business would be primarily limited to internally within our group, not externally toward other burners. The event is explicitly \"money free\" and \"promotion free\"... and if we're promoting money then we FAIL doubly\nWith that said, many burners would be interested in a counter-culture monetary system - so hopefully lots of organic conversations could happen.\n2) There's actually an issue of ticketing this year... basically the event has gotten so large that there are not enough tickets. Because the operators don't understand how price mechanisms work, they thought it'd be better to distribute tickets on a lottery system than by raising prices to curb demand. Any free-marketer would be able to predict the outcome - shortages! I have no idea how to get tickets this year, and it might be impossible to do in any coordinated way for a group of us. So, this might be a problem :/\n3) Burning Man is absolutely wild and awesome and interesting (just like Bitcoin). I can think of no better way to spend a week with fellow bitcoiners. But, it's intense, and requires lots of planning. Cannot be done last-minute. Requires commitment and dedication.\n4) A nice RV is mandatory... fuck tents in the hot sun.

Thanks for volunteering me Charlie\nSuch a trip will be absolutely fantastic under the following conditions:\n1) First and foremost, the purpose has to be to go with bitcoiners as a social and networking and ideating activity. We'll be able to talk bitcoin all day long among ourselves and I'm sure some great work would come out of it. BUT - we will not (and should not) be able to \"sell\" or promote bitcoin at Burning Man in any visible way. If it comes up in conversation with outsiders, that's great, but we can't be there to evangelize. So to the extent that it's partly a business trip, the business would be primarily limited to internally within our group, not externally toward other burners. The event is explicitly \"money free\" and \"promotion free\"... and if we're promoting money then we FAIL doubly\nWith that said, many burners would be interested in a counter-culture monetary system - so hopefully lots of organic conversations could happen.\n2) There's actually an issue of ticketing this year... basically the event has gotten so large that there are not enough tickets. Because the operators don't understand how price mechanisms work, they thought it'd be better to distribute tickets on a lottery system than by raising prices to curb demand. Any free-marketer would be able to predict the outcome - shortages! I have no idea how to get tickets this year, and it might be impossible to do in any coordinated way for a group of us. So, this might be a problem :/\n3) Burning Man is absolutely wild and awesome and interesting (just like Bitcoin). I can think of no better way to spend a week with fellow bitcoiners.

Thanks for volunteering me Charlie\nSuch a trip will be absolutely fantastic under the following conditions:\n1) First and foremost, the purpose has to be to go with bitcoiners as a social and networking and ideating activity. We'll be able to talk bitcoin all day long among ourselves and I'm sure some great work would come out of it. BUT - we will not (and should not) be able to \"sell\" or promote bitcoin at Burning Man in any visible way. If it comes up in conversation with outsiders, that's great, but we can't be there to evangelize. So to the extent that it's partly a business trip, the business would be primarily limited to internally within our group, not externally toward other burners. The event is explicitly \"money free\" and \"promotion free\"... and if we're promoting money then we FAIL doubly\nWith that said, many burners would be interested in a counter-culture monetary system - so hopefully lots of organic conversations could happen.\n2) There's actually an issue of ticketing this year... basically the event has gotten so large that there are not enough tickets. Because the operators don't understand how price mechanisms work, they thought it'd be better to distribute tickets on a lottery system than by raising prices to curb demand. Any free-marketer would be able to predict the outcome - shortages! I have no idea how to get tickets this year, and it might be impossible to do in any coordinated way for a group of us. So, this might be a problem :/\n3) Burning Man is absolutely wild and awesome and interesting (just like Bitcoin). I can think of no better way to spend a week with fellow bitcoiners. But, it's intense, and requires lots of planning. Cannot be done last-minute. Requires commitment and dedication.\n4) A nice RV is mandatory... fuck tents in the hot sun.
