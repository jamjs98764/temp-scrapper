Or you could skip using tor and just use the public wifi although it would leak your general location but your identity would probably be hidden\nSince the very early days (which was mid 2011 in my case) it struck me that Bitcoin has the potential to be very resilient because the data need is tiny and because it is not latency sensitive.  Absolutely the potential exists for transactions to be performed in even the most hostile environments though the methods you describe among others.\nAs I've alluded to before, I've assumed for some time that extensive deep packet capture and analysis has been underway.  The next shoe to drop would be active filtering.  We'd have to see compelling reason to do it, but if/when that reason comes into existence I expect that it will happen rapidly.  Even in this 'hostile environment' Bitcoin has a very real potential to continue to provide a framework for economic activity.\nThat said, it will never be exactly easy to use Bitcoin in an adverse environment.  A small fraction of people will have little trouble, and a growing fraction of people will develop the skills needed to do so, but we are still talking about a rarefied population.  And the notion of 'real time' activity would have to be drastically curtailed.  It never was a good fit with Bitcoin's design in the first place.  Anyway, this is the basis for my being fairly negative about efforts to extend the solution widely into the sphere of the masses and to try to forge it into a real-time solution (the domain of cash.)  Both of these will prove to be significant negatives if/when there is a genuine need for the solution.\nI'm pretty much at the point now in the middle of 2014 of considering Bitcoin to be fatally damaged for the use-case that I envision as most valuable.  Maybe it could help bootstrap in a more viable and focused solution, but Bitcoin proper simply did not attempt to occupy the niche of a robust solution in a different and more hostile world than we see today.  Hopefully time will prove that it didn't matter much and nothing bad will happen in the real world.\n", "author": "tvbcof Legendary Offline Activity: 2618 Merit: 1005 "}, {"date": "2014-06-15 21:05:27", "content": "I've always been more concerned about timing analysis at the network level.\nThere's a way to fix that, if you don't care about burning bandwidth.\nSet up your node to transmit data to each peer at a fixed rate regardless of how much real traffic it actually has to send.

Of course this would happen.\nHowever, it is still a very salient question to ask because even if all any government could do to harm bitcoin was to injure (or beat up on) its reputation, functionality,  or price somehow, that would be a very big deal for all of us that have been early adopters/investors, especially if the world moves into some other system and tends to abandon the \"old tech bitcoin\". I sure am hoping that my bitcoin will continue to appreciate in value over time and do not eventually just fall victim to a more competitive and/or government-proof coin. I want bitcoin to always have a strong reputation and value.\nI'm sure many of the prominent bitcoiners who have fought through the early trials of this technology to bring it to the masses would feel quite cheated if their dedicated efforts turn out to be for a coin that just didn't have the muscle to evolve well enough long term.\nLets say hypothetically, one of the so-called 2.0 coins like NXT or Blackcoin simply turn out to be evolutionarily superior because, say, they are far more resistant to government or centralized manipulation. What if money were to pour out of bitcoin's market share into other \"safe-haven 2.0 coins\" during a moment of perceived crisis? For example, some mining operation gains a massive level of control over the system or a government secretly or subversively purchases two of the biggest mining pools and then intentionally tries to do whatever they could technologically (or even politically) to create uncertainty/fear regarding control of what is supposed to be a \"trustless system\"? It's feasible, and perhaps even likely, for things like this to happen eventually, especially if bitcoin becomes a massive global force that continually siphons world economic power.\nI suspect there are smaller industrialized or developing countries, which as time goes on, could see their national currencies crumble in the face of bitcoin. It makes sense that smaller and/or more corrupt nations would be the first ones to lose control of their own currencies as crypto proves to be far more reliable than a system manipulated by a government which, say for example, is run by gangsters.\nSince the vast majority of a nation's power is vested in it's ability to issue and manipulate a sovereign currency, I could see a desperate nation attempting any manner of assault on the biggest perceived crypto threat (a.k.a. bitcoin), simply to create fear or loss in value. Yes it would ultimately be futile, but they might succeed in shifting some technologic train tracks. Smarter nations, hopefully, will try to be a part of this innovative technology over time, potentially shielding it to some degree from the temper tantrums of nations which are run by idiots who rely on contrived state power and suppression.\nBottom line for me:\nI want bitcoin to be the winner. I want to have been an early adopter.\nPlease don't tell me that down the road 20 years, everybody is using blackcoin simply because \"the great mining panic of 2018\" made everybody sell bitcoin and buy into a system the government couldn't screw up as easily\n.  My bitcoin could potentially be worth very little in a situation like that and I don't own any blackcoin.  What if bitcoin is just traded as a \"curiosity coin\" and eventually becomes vastly eclipsed in value? Frankly, there are so many alternatives out there right now, I doubt I would end up picking the right one. I sat in the audience in Amsterdam in May and heard Gavin say something to the effect that he hoped bitcoin would be declared the ultimate winner down the road, but that it was very possible for some other math-based currency to become the dominant system.\nI want to bet on the horse that eventually wins this race. And it's a marathon boys, not a sprint. So naturally the big question is: Is bitcoin more naturally suited for the long race or just as an intro coin to prove the concept?

Participants further concluded that short-term remedies are best suited until a permanent fix is discovered and implemented.\nNotably, GHash.io, one of the largest mining pool operators in the ecosystem, has agreed to do all it can to limit its share of the total bitcoin network to 39.99%. This includes asking miners to shift hashing power away from their pools when the hash rate reaches that amount.\nA policy of this kind will be recommended to all operators within the bitcoin mining ecosystem.\nThough the findings stop short of a conclusive solution, GHash CIO Jeffrey Smith said that temporary ways to mitigate the risk of a 51% attack are the right choice at this time, saying:\nNone of the existing technical solutions against the 51% attack threat is able to solve the problem in a long-term perspective, taking into account interests of existing mining pools, individual miners and bitcoin community. Thus, bitcoin adherents should focus on temporary acts until the lifetime solution is found.\nThe company has taken steps in recent months to assuage community concerns about any role it could have in a 51% attack. In June, the company declared in a statement that it supports decentralization within the mining network and would never participate in fraudulent behavior.\nAction committee to commence\nThough no lasting solution was found for the 51% threat, the summit did result in a framework that could help the bitcoin industry work toward an eventual solution.\nA new committee is expected to be organized by GHash.io and its digital currency exchange arm, CEX.io, that direct funds and coordinate efforts on a permanent means to address the problem. The funds will provide a vehicle for accelerating and motivating developers to find a technical solution to the 51% threat by accumulating funds and directing them to this process.\nThe document reads:\nThe committee will drive closer communication and cooperation between developers working on the bitcoin protocol and solving the 51% issue, and businesses, highly interested in expanding the industry and promote bitcoin to a broader audience.\nGHash.io and CEX.io will manage the committee, which will consist of representatitves of pool operators, bitcoin companies and other members of the mining community. According to the document, those who attended the summit in London are expected to continue developing a structure for the committee in the months ahead.\nBolstering network confidence\nThe threat of a 51% attack  the theoretical power of one entity within the bitcoin network to successfully broadcast fraudulent transactions and disrupt legitimate ones  has long been a source of concern for some members of the bitcoin community.\nSome of the fear has been directed at GHash.io itself. This owes to the pools outsized hashing power, which some are worried could be used to manipulate transactions in the network. Others who attended the meeting characterized it as an informal effort to open up lines of communication between interests in the space.\nBitGo co-founder and CEO Will OBrien told CoinDesk that one of the outcomes of the meeting is that the community itself needs to play a role in finding a solution. OBrien told CoinDesk:\nIts incumbent upon the industry leaders themselves to make changes that build confidence among the broad bitcoin community, investment community, and the press. We cannot and should not rely on one or more trade organizations to set the rules. Bitcoin is decentralized, and we must build solutions that support that original framework of decision-making.\nPeter Todd was less convinced that the meeting had a decidedly positive outcome. He remarked that the gravity of the situation  both in the short-term and in the long-term  may not be fully appreciated by the GHash.io leadership, saying:\nTalking to the community is a great first step. That said I didnt get the impression that GHash.io really understood the magnitude of the problem. In particular, they seemed much more focused on getting the bitcoin community to trust them, rather than putting themselves in a position where we dont have too.\nHe noted that a particularly damaging impact of the centralization of hashing power is a growing fear among investors about the ramifications of a potentially monopolized network.\nTodd told CoinDesk that the issue poses a serious long-term obstacle to investment, but pointed to efforts to develop solutions that he said were promising. Only funding and support, he concluded, will determine how quickly and successfully a fix to the 51% vulnerability is created.\nPeernova president Emmanuel Abiodun said that, ultimately, the cooperation that began in London will lead to greater transparency in the mining space and a push toward more decentralization. He also said that a new mining pool being developed by Peernova would abide by a similar cap like the one being sought by GHash.io.\nHe told CoinDesk that its a matter of ensuring the transaction network remains healthy, saying:\nThe hundreds of millions of dollars being put into bitcoin by VCs are worth peanuts if we do not have the secure infrastructure miners are putting into place today. VCs need to engage more with miners and not make the same mistakes that were made in the video streaming industry in taking infrastructure for granted.\nIndustry-wide issue develops\nMembers of the bitcoin community have been clamoring for a fix to both the risk of a 51% attack and the conglomeration of hashing power around several large operations. By limiting itself to just below 40%, GHash.io is acknowledging the need to address what has been called by many a growing problem for the networks long-term health.\nThe summit  and the proposed committee  also demonstrates a willingness to engage among the bitcoin industrys major players. As well, the presence of bitcoin core developers and companies outside of the mining sector will no doubt enhance the profile of efforts to develop a fix to the 51% attack issue.\nGHash.io, as well as other summit attendees, have called on the community as a whole to help realize a solution to the problem. The group has asked for companies to take part in the proposed committee as well as assist in funding research and development that enhances the security of the bitcoin network.\nStill, the topic has been much debated in the industry, with some contending that no solution needs to be found to the 51% attack risk.\nFor more on this issue and its implications for bitcoin\nSource \"\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/ghash-commits-40-hashrate-cap-bitcoin-mining-summit/\n\"\n", "views": 1133, "author": "Coinbuddy Hero Member Offline Activity: 896 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGHash Commits to 40% Hashrate Cap at Bitcoin Mining Summit #ghash #summit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-07-17 08:27:15", "content": "why is more effort not being put into p2pool?  or has it been decided its not an effective solution?\n", "author": "stryker Sr. Member Offline Activity: 490 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-07-17 08:54:37", "content": "why is more effort not being put into p2pool?  or has it been decided its not an effective solution?\np2pool simply needs more funding of software development to improve it.

That's the whole point of Bitcoin -- decentralization. The fact that mining is now gradually converging into a centralized state is not a flaw in the mining process, but rather a direct consequence of miners becoming greedy. This trend will continue until all pool operators decide to limit their hashing capacity. Ghash and everyone who insists on mining there with only profit in their minds are the problem, not Bitcoin or mining.\nSorry but I think I disagree.\nQuite on the contrary, I think that the problem with mining centralization can be effectively considered a flaw of the protocol and it has to be resolved somehow.\nThe greed is something inherent the human being, the man, the miner, the pool operator. Bitcoin must be superior to that.\nWe cannot just hope that these actors will change their minds and won't be greedy anymore, because it will not happen.\nSometime there is someone with good intentions, like the recent GHash.IO statement, but at all times it could appear a player greedier than the previous one. Also, we should consider that even if greed was totally absent, the problem would still be here because anyone with enought resources could be able to destroy bitcoin for whatever reason.\nNo, I really think that it should be the protocol itself able to auto-defends and to defeat any threat.\nThe protocol is open source though, which makes any attempt to completely thwart the effects of human greed simply a delaying deterrent at best. Also, any theoretical principle will always play out differently when applied in the real world, which means that even a perfect protocol will eventually find itself abused and exploited. So the mining process is adequately functional as it is now, in my opinion.\nIf you want to keep the blockchain as decentralized as possible independent of people's behaviours, then you would need to rewrite a large part of, if not the whole, protocol and make it closed source. That's obviously out of the question. Ergo, it's the miners themselves who have to change.\n", "author": "Relnarien Sr. Member Offline Activity: 400 Merit: 251 "}], "date": "2014-07-22 04:37:10"}, {"content": "Did anyone else get a letter from Tokyo District Civil 20th Division about Mt.Gox?\nIt all in Japanese but i am asuming it has to do with the bankruptcy.

Or you could skip using tor and just use the public wifi although it would leak your general location but your identity would probably be hidden\nSince the very early days (which was mid 2011 in my case) it struck me that Bitcoin has the potential to be very resilient because the data need is tiny and because it is not latency sensitive.  Absolutely the potential exists for transactions to be performed in even the most hostile environments though the methods you describe among others.\nAs I've alluded to before, I've assumed for some time that extensive deep packet capture and analysis has been underway.  The next shoe to drop would be active filtering.  We'd have to see compelling reason to do it, but if/when that reason comes into existence I expect that it will happen rapidly.  Even in this 'hostile environment' Bitcoin has a very real potential to continue to provide a framework for economic activity.\nThat said, it will never be exactly easy to use Bitcoin in an adverse environment.  A small fraction of people will have little trouble, and a growing fraction of people will develop the skills needed to do so, but we are still talking about a rarefied population.  And the notion of 'real time' activity would have to be drastically curtailed.  It never was a good fit with Bitcoin's design in the first place.  Anyway, this is the basis for my being fairly negative about efforts to extend the solution widely into the sphere of the masses and to try to forge it into a real-time solution (the domain of cash.)  Both of these will prove to be significant negatives if/when there is a genuine need for the solution.\nI'm pretty much at the point now in the middle of 2014 of considering Bitcoin to be fatally damaged for the use-case that I envision as most valuable.  Maybe it could help bootstrap in a more viable and focused solution, but Bitcoin proper simply did not attempt to occupy the niche of a robust solution in a different and more hostile world than we see today.  Hopefully time will prove that it didn't matter much and nothing bad will happen in the real world.\n", "author": "tvbcof Legendary Offline Activity: 2618 Merit: 1005 "}, {"date": "2014-06-15 21:05:27", "content": "I've always been more concerned about timing analysis at the network level.\nThere's a way to fix that, if you don't care about burning bandwidth.\nSet up your node to transmit data to each peer at a fixed rate regardless of how much real traffic it actually has to send.

Of course this would happen.\nHowever, it is still a very salient question to ask because even if all any government could do to harm bitcoin was to injure (or beat up on) its reputation, functionality,  or price somehow, that would be a very big deal for all of us that have been early adopters/investors, especially if the world moves into some other system and tends to abandon the \"old tech bitcoin\". I sure am hoping that my bitcoin will continue to appreciate in value over time and do not eventually just fall victim to a more competitive and/or government-proof coin. I want bitcoin to always have a strong reputation and value.\nI'm sure many of the prominent bitcoiners who have fought through the early trials of this technology to bring it to the masses would feel quite cheated if their dedicated efforts turn out to be for a coin that just didn't have the muscle to evolve well enough long term.\nLets say hypothetically, one of the so-called 2.0 coins like NXT or Blackcoin simply turn out to be evolutionarily superior because, say, they are far more resistant to government or centralized manipulation. What if money were to pour out of bitcoin's market share into other \"safe-haven 2.0 coins\" during a moment of perceived crisis? For example, some mining operation gains a massive level of control over the system or a government secretly or subversively purchases two of the biggest mining pools and then intentionally tries to do whatever they could technologically (or even politically) to create uncertainty/fear regarding control of what is supposed to be a \"trustless system\"? It's feasible, and perhaps even likely, for things like this to happen eventually, especially if bitcoin becomes a massive global force that continually siphons world economic power.\nI suspect there are smaller industrialized or developing countries, which as time goes on, could see their national currencies crumble in the face of bitcoin. It makes sense that smaller and/or more corrupt nations would be the first ones to lose control of their own currencies as crypto proves to be far more reliable than a system manipulated by a government which, say for example, is run by gangsters.\nSince the vast majority of a nation's power is vested in it's ability to issue and manipulate a sovereign currency, I could see a desperate nation attempting any manner of assault on the biggest perceived crypto threat (a.k.a. bitcoin), simply to create fear or loss in value. Yes it would ultimately be futile, but they might succeed in shifting some technologic train tracks. Smarter nations, hopefully, will try to be a part of this innovative technology over time, potentially shielding it to some degree from the temper tantrums of nations which are run by idiots who rely on contrived state power and suppression.\nBottom line for me:\nI want bitcoin to be the winner. I want to have been an early adopter.\nPlease don't tell me that down the road 20 years, everybody is using blackcoin simply because \"the great mining panic of 2018\" made everybody sell bitcoin and buy into a system the government couldn't screw up as easily\n.  My bitcoin could potentially be worth very little in a situation like that and I don't own any blackcoin.  What if bitcoin is just traded as a \"curiosity coin\" and eventually becomes vastly eclipsed in value? Frankly, there are so many alternatives out there right now, I doubt I would end up picking the right one. I sat in the audience in Amsterdam in May and heard Gavin say something to the effect that he hoped bitcoin would be declared the ultimate winner down the road, but that it was very possible for some other math-based currency to become the dominant system.\nI want to bet on the horse that eventually wins this race. And it's a marathon boys, not a sprint. So naturally the big question is: Is bitcoin more naturally suited for the long race or just as an intro coin to prove the concept?

Participants further concluded that short-term remedies are best suited until a permanent fix is discovered and implemented.\nNotably, GHash.io, one of the largest mining pool operators in the ecosystem, has agreed to do all it can to limit its share of the total bitcoin network to 39.99%. This includes asking miners to shift hashing power away from their pools when the hash rate reaches that amount.\nA policy of this kind will be recommended to all operators within the bitcoin mining ecosystem.\nThough the findings stop short of a conclusive solution, GHash CIO Jeffrey Smith said that temporary ways to mitigate the risk of a 51% attack are the right choice at this time, saying:\nNone of the existing technical solutions against the 51% attack threat is able to solve the problem in a long-term perspective, taking into account interests of existing mining pools, individual miners and bitcoin community. Thus, bitcoin adherents should focus on temporary acts until the lifetime solution is found.\nThe company has taken steps in recent months to assuage community concerns about any role it could have in a 51% attack. In June, the company declared in a statement that it supports decentralization within the mining network and would never participate in fraudulent behavior.\nAction committee to commence\nThough no lasting solution was found for the 51% threat, the summit did result in a framework that could help the bitcoin industry work toward an eventual solution.\nA new committee is expected to be organized by GHash.io and its digital currency exchange arm, CEX.io, that direct funds and coordinate efforts on a permanent means to address the problem. The funds will provide a vehicle for accelerating and motivating developers to find a technical solution to the 51% threat by accumulating funds and directing them to this process.\nThe document reads:\nThe committee will drive closer communication and cooperation between developers working on the bitcoin protocol and solving the 51% issue, and businesses, highly interested in expanding the industry and promote bitcoin to a broader audience.\nGHash.io and CEX.io will manage the committee, which will consist of representatitves of pool operators, bitcoin companies and other members of the mining community. According to the document, those who attended the summit in London are expected to continue developing a structure for the committee in the months ahead.\nBolstering network confidence\nThe threat of a 51% attack  the theoretical power of one entity within the bitcoin network to successfully broadcast fraudulent transactions and disrupt legitimate ones  has long been a source of concern for some members of the bitcoin community.\nSome of the fear has been directed at GHash.io itself. This owes to the pools outsized hashing power, which some are worried could be used to manipulate transactions in the network. Others who attended the meeting characterized it as an informal effort to open up lines of communication between interests in the space.\nBitGo co-founder and CEO Will OBrien told CoinDesk that one of the outcomes of the meeting is that the community itself needs to play a role in finding a solution. OBrien told CoinDesk:\nIts incumbent upon the industry leaders themselves to make changes that build confidence among the broad bitcoin community, investment community, and the press. We cannot and should not rely on one or more trade organizations to set the rules. Bitcoin is decentralized, and we must build solutions that support that original framework of decision-making.\nPeter Todd was less convinced that the meeting had a decidedly positive outcome. He remarked that the gravity of the situation  both in the short-term and in the long-term  may not be fully appreciated by the GHash.io leadership, saying:\nTalking to the community is a great first step. That said I didnt get the impression that GHash.io really understood the magnitude of the problem. In particular, they seemed much more focused on getting the bitcoin community to trust them, rather than putting themselves in a position where we dont have too.\nHe noted that a particularly damaging impact of the centralization of hashing power is a growing fear among investors about the ramifications of a potentially monopolized network.\nTodd told CoinDesk that the issue poses a serious long-term obstacle to investment, but pointed to efforts to develop solutions that he said were promising. Only funding and support, he concluded, will determine how quickly and successfully a fix to the 51% vulnerability is created.\nPeernova president Emmanuel Abiodun said that, ultimately, the cooperation that began in London will lead to greater transparency in the mining space and a push toward more decentralization. He also said that a new mining pool being developed by Peernova would abide by a similar cap like the one being sought by GHash.io.\nHe told CoinDesk that its a matter of ensuring the transaction network remains healthy, saying:\nThe hundreds of millions of dollars being put into bitcoin by VCs are worth peanuts if we do not have the secure infrastructure miners are putting into place today. VCs need to engage more with miners and not make the same mistakes that were made in the video streaming industry in taking infrastructure for granted.\nIndustry-wide issue develops\nMembers of the bitcoin community have been clamoring for a fix to both the risk of a 51% attack and the conglomeration of hashing power around several large operations. By limiting itself to just below 40%, GHash.io is acknowledging the need to address what has been called by many a growing problem for the networks long-term health.\nThe summit  and the proposed committee  also demonstrates a willingness to engage among the bitcoin industrys major players. As well, the presence of bitcoin core developers and companies outside of the mining sector will no doubt enhance the profile of efforts to develop a fix to the 51% attack issue.\nGHash.io, as well as other summit attendees, have called on the community as a whole to help realize a solution to the problem. The group has asked for companies to take part in the proposed committee as well as assist in funding research and development that enhances the security of the bitcoin network.\nStill, the topic has been much debated in the industry, with some contending that no solution needs to be found to the 51% attack risk.\nFor more on this issue and its implications for bitcoin\nSource \"\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/ghash-commits-40-hashrate-cap-bitcoin-mining-summit/\n\"\n", "views": 1133, "author": "Coinbuddy Hero Member Offline Activity: 896 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGHash Commits to 40% Hashrate Cap at Bitcoin Mining Summit #ghash #summit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-07-17 08:27:15", "content": "why is more effort not being put into p2pool?  or has it been decided its not an effective solution?\n", "author": "stryker Sr. Member Offline Activity: 490 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-07-17 08:54:37", "content": "why is more effort not being put into p2pool?  or has it been decided its not an effective solution?\np2pool simply needs more funding of software development to improve it.
