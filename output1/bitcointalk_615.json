However let me offer a defense of payment processors.\nI have talked to a lot of businesses about BTC and they often have the same concerns. One realistic concern is price volitility. For a business the money never stops flowing in and out. They need most of each sale to cover fixed costs and new stock. It would be disastrous to get a lot of business in bitcoin then watch half of it go away in a crash. Many businesses can't weather that uncertainty.\nThere is also the problem of managing a wallet. This is all so new, and with money on the line it can be scary to amass bitcoin. Someone at the business would need to know how to safely collect, store, and cash out bitcoin. It may make more sense for a place to farm out the bitcoin processing for low fees. My guess is that the future will see a diversity of systems from \"roll-your-own\" to \"never-touch-bitcoin\" processing.\n", "author": "RodeoX Legendary Offline Activity: 2744 Merit: 1057 The revolution will be monetized!

Or at least from specialized people who are certified to give help and you are sure that you receive true help. Then don't understand in this project the place of the \"financial freedom from the gov and banking systems and bringing everyone closer together\". How can be achieved this financial freedom from the Government and banks? Mining bitcoin or buying those&gt; But where to find the money to buy bitcoin or the equipment to mine?

I don't fear banks as much as I fear another alternative to the inflationary-based crisis.\nOf course bitcoin has other advantages than being deflationary but right now, the biggest one is that one, because of the inflation getting out of control.\nBesides, bitcoin is still young, and, I was about to say, weak. It needs to be consolidated. It doesn't need a nemesis. I'm not saying that this is the death of bitcoin because it would be too easy and bitcoin is already stronger than that, but it sure will be a big blow :-/\nEspecially for the European market, since the other big advantage of bitcoin is cheap transactions, which Europeans don't care about because they already have them.\nThe news is from the end of last December.

Antonopoulos, Matt Corallo, Jeremy Allaire, Michael Perklin, Sean Neville and others.\nAdditional work for fostering development is in the areas of exploring better ways to bridge the gap of knowledge between development and the public and corporations.\nThe foundation Chief Scientist is Gavin Andresen. The foundation also wishes to create a Technical Communications Committee which will be chaired by someone with significant knowledge about core development. The primary role of this committee will be to bridge the gap between protocol development and the public and business leaders by updating members of the industry on current events in development and what they mean to the Bitcoin industry.\n**********************************\n", "author": "Peter R Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1006 "}, {"date": "2015-12-23 23:30:50", "content": "Additional work for fostering development is in the areas of exploring better ways to bridge the gap of knowledge between development and the public and corporations.\nwhats needed is better commenting of code. maybe as a separate code repository where each line of code is commented to explain things better, back in my day we not only had to comment code, but also write 'pseudo-code' (laymans version) to help explain it better.\nits ok to only write code if your the only coder and you understand where one line of code affects the other instantly.. but when there are strangers looking at it or taking over projects then it must be made as simple as possible for others to read the code and understand it without having to scroll pages of pure code just to find references and functions to get to know how it works\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Offline Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2015-12-23 23:35:33", "content": "Additional work for fostering development is in the areas of exploring better ways to bridge the gap of knowledge between development and the public and corporations.\nwhats needed is better commenting of code. maybe as a separate code repository where each line of code is commented to explain things better, back in my day we not only had to comment code, but also write 'pseudo-code' (laymans version) to help explain it better.\nits ok to only write code if your the only coder and you understand where one line of code affects the other instantly.. but when there are strangers looking at it or taking over projects then it must be made as simple as possible for others to read the code and understand it without having to scroll pages of pure code just to find references and functions to get to know how it works\nAgreed!\n", "author": "Peter R Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1006 "}, {"date": "2015-12-24 01:53:33", "content": "Thanks for the productive comments.\nThe Bitcoin Foundation belongs to everyone in Bitcoin it's as much yours as it is mine or any other member or the boards.\nI think the foundation was a joke and instead of wishing it to be destroyed I accepted a volunteer offer to work to fix it.\nIf we all put our heads and a little effort and acknowledge that the past is the past and say we've got this thing, let's do something useful with it then that is a positive.\n", "author": "BruceFenton Sr. Member Offline Activity: 403 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-12-24 18:26:25", "content": "The Bitcoin Foundation's name is too tainted in my opinion and will never get much community support.

However let me offer a defense of payment processors.\nI have talked to a lot of businesses about BTC and they often have the same concerns. One realistic concern is price volitility. For a business the money never stops flowing in and out. They need most of each sale to cover fixed costs and new stock. It would be disastrous to get a lot of business in bitcoin then watch half of it go away in a crash. Many businesses can't weather that uncertainty.\nThere is also the problem of managing a wallet. This is all so new, and with money on the line it can be scary to amass bitcoin. Someone at the business would need to know how to safely collect, store, and cash out bitcoin. It may make more sense for a place to farm out the bitcoin processing for low fees. My guess is that the future will see a diversity of systems from \"roll-your-own\" to \"never-touch-bitcoin\" processing.\n", "author": "RodeoX Legendary Offline Activity: 2744 Merit: 1057 The revolution will be monetized!

And the end at internet can be found thousand of stories or advice for free. It was enough to do a simple search and you can find everything you want. Most of those for free. Or at least from specialized people who are certified to give help and you are sure that you receive true help. Then don't understand in this project the place of the \"financial freedom from the gov and banking systems and bringing everyone closer together\". How can be achieved this financial freedom from the Government and banks? Mining bitcoin or buying those&gt; But where to find the money to buy bitcoin or the equipment to mine?

Most of the financial institutions when are in a financial crisis will go for a loan from the central bank so as to meet the demands of the reserve. Even though the banks do make enough, there is always a bigger chunk that is stolen through the invention and technology related methods. This makes them have a shortfall and thus the reason why they may have the fraction reserve that is below the required one.  It is always a complicated thing.\n", "author": "Mr. Forum Member Offline Activity: 70 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2016-01-05 18:18:24", "content": "Any competition is a good thing in my personal opinion.

This is precisely the nemesis of bitcoin. I was talking about bitcoin today, advertising it to some friends, and this precise point is the one I said I was afraid of. Bitcoin was created as an alternative to inflationary fiat, which is at the basis of today's crisis. If fiat becomes deflationary, than that's a serious blow to bitcoin. I don't fear banks as much as I fear another alternative to the inflationary-based crisis.\nOf course bitcoin has other advantages than being deflationary but right now, the biggest one is that one, because of the inflation getting out of control.\nBesides, bitcoin is still young, and, I was about to say, weak. It needs to be consolidated. It doesn't need a nemesis. I'm not saying that this is the death of bitcoin because it would be too easy and bitcoin is already stronger than that, but it sure will be a big blow :-/\nEspecially for the European market, since the other big advantage of bitcoin is cheap transactions, which Europeans don't care about because they already have them.\nThe news is from the end of last December. I guess this is one of the reasons why BTC dropped from $460+ to $430 recently. Only guessing here, though. If so and provided everything stays in place from now, than it seems to be quite ok.

Antonopoulos, Matt Corallo, Jeremy Allaire, Michael Perklin, Sean Neville and others.\nAdditional work for fostering development is in the areas of exploring better ways to bridge the gap of knowledge between development and the public and corporations.\nThe foundation Chief Scientist is Gavin Andresen. The foundation also wishes to create a Technical Communications Committee which will be chaired by someone with significant knowledge about core development. The primary role of this committee will be to bridge the gap between protocol development and the public and business leaders by updating members of the industry on current events in development and what they mean to the Bitcoin industry.\n**********************************\n", "author": "Peter R Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1006 "}, {"date": "2015-12-23 23:30:50", "content": "Additional work for fostering development is in the areas of exploring better ways to bridge the gap of knowledge between development and the public and corporations.\nwhats needed is better commenting of code. maybe as a separate code repository where each line of code is commented to explain things better, back in my day we not only had to comment code, but also write 'pseudo-code' (laymans version) to help explain it better.\nits ok to only write code if your the only coder and you understand where one line of code affects the other instantly.. but when there are strangers looking at it or taking over projects then it must be made as simple as possible for others to read the code and understand it without having to scroll pages of pure code just to find references and functions to get to know how it works\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Offline Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2015-12-23 23:35:33", "content": "Additional work for fostering development is in the areas of exploring better ways to bridge the gap of knowledge between development and the public and corporations.\nwhats needed is better commenting of code. maybe as a separate code repository where each line of code is commented to explain things better, back in my day we not only had to comment code, but also write 'pseudo-code' (laymans version) to help explain it better.\nits ok to only write code if your the only coder and you understand where one line of code affects the other instantly.. but when there are strangers looking at it or taking over projects then it must be made as simple as possible for others to read the code and understand it without having to scroll pages of pure code just to find references and functions to get to know how it works\nAgreed!\n", "author": "Peter R Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1006 "}, {"date": "2015-12-24 01:53:33", "content": "Thanks for the productive comments.\nThe Bitcoin Foundation belongs to everyone in Bitcoin it's as much yours as it is mine or any other member or the boards.\nI think the foundation was a joke and instead of wishing it to be destroyed I accepted a volunteer offer to work to fix it.\nIf we all put our heads and a little effort and acknowledge that the past is the past and say we've got this thing, let's do something useful with it then that is a positive.\n", "author": "BruceFenton Sr. Member Offline Activity: 403 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-12-24 18:26:25", "content": "The Bitcoin Foundation's name is too tainted in my opinion and will never get much community support.
