If you have such a loooooooooooooong message to tell the world, use text, not video. I would be ok with reading the transcript, though.\nHowever, I read\nhow it works\nfrom bitshares.org and some bits from the\nwiki\n. It seems interesting but complicated, just like Bitcoin\nAbout the hate on this forum, there are 2 things that I'd like to point out.\nFirst is that while I see some parallels in blockchain technology, I fail to understand the relationship between Bitcoin and Bitshares. There are *zero* occurrences of 'bitcoin' on the 'How it works' page. So maybe that Bitcoin invested people are perceiving it as a competing crypto, aka altcoin, and altcoins justifiably got a bad name on this forum because of what I'd call the \"shitcoin spree\" in 2014.\nSecond is that what I call the noise on this forum has increased significantly during the last two years, compared to what I experienced when I started posting here in early 2013. Let me define it shortly: I call 'signal' people exchanging ideas and information about Bitcoin. I call 'noise' people trolling, those who see bitcoin as a get-rich-quick thingie, those who want to earn $$$ without working, etc. Unfortunately, the signal-to-noise ratio has gone much lower when Bitcoin prices started to explode (it was $27 when I joined).\nSo, it might be genius or stupid, I can't really say at this stage. What I can say is that I wouldn't take the hate here as a reasonable confirmation or denial of BitShares being either genius or stupid.\n", "author": "matt4054 Legendary Offline Activity: 1540 Merit: 1000 BitcoinQueue.com "}, {"date": "2015-03-13 02:27:33", "content": "So, it might be genius or stupid, I can't really say at this stage.

Elizabeth Rossiello, chief executive of BitPesa, told the BBC that a shortage of payment options in Africa is driving bitcoin use.\nItÂ’s also cheaper: that 3 per cent fee contrasts sharply with an average 12.3 per cent paid to money transmitters by Africans living abroad, according to figures by the Overseas Development Institute. The ODI said that total annual fees to money transmitters amount to $1.4 billion.\nIn some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, MoneyGram and Western Union control 50 per cent of the remittance market while credit cards are available to less than 3 per cent of the population. Other web solutions like PayPal are not widespread and can also be expensive. Bank transfers are no better Â– they can be two the three times as expensive as other countries.\nAfrica is fertile ground for bitcoin. It has history with mobile money services that allow users to pay for good using a mobile phone as an alternative to cash or cards. A mobile money service called M-Pesa is now so widespread in Kenya that almost 70 per cent of the volume of all national payments is made through the service.\nToby Shapshak, a technology journalist, said that M-Pesa has become a financial institution in its own right. Â“You can pay school fees, you can buy groceries, IÂ’m told you can even bribe customs officials using MPesa. The most important thing is that you can do it on the most basic of cell phone because Africa isnÂ’t a smart phone continent yet,Â” Shapshak told the Guardian.\nBitcoin works with this local economy. Once it is received by a transmitter like BitPesa it can be converted into M-Pesa in Kenyan shillings.\nWhile bitcoin is on the rise, liquidity might still be a problem. As a commodity, can also be subject to greater volatility than currencies, though remittance companies say they combat this by immediately converting transfers.\nTransparency can also be an issue.

Elizabeth Rossiello, chief executive of BitPesa, told the BBC that a shortage of payment options in Africa is driving bitcoin use.\nItÂ’s also cheaper: that 3 per cent fee contrasts sharply with an average 12.3 per cent paid to money transmitters by Africans living abroad, according to figures by the Overseas Development Institute. The ODI said that total annual fees to money transmitters amount to $1.4 billion.\nIn some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, MoneyGram and Western Union control 50 per cent of the remittance market while credit cards are available to less than 3 per cent of the population. Other web solutions like PayPal are not widespread and can also be expensive. Bank transfers are no better Â– they can be two the three times as expensive as other countries.\nAfrica is fertile ground for bitcoin. It has history with mobile money services that allow users to pay for good using a mobile phone as an alternative to cash or cards. A mobile money service called M-Pesa is now so widespread in Kenya that almost 70 per cent of the volume of all national payments is made through the service.\nToby Shapshak, a technology journalist, said that M-Pesa has become a financial institution in its own right. Â“You can pay school fees, you can buy groceries, IÂ’m told you can even bribe customs officials using MPesa. The most important thing is that you can do it on the most basic of cell phone because Africa isnÂ’t a smart phone continent yet,Â” Shapshak told the Guardian.\nBitcoin works with this local economy. Once it is received by a transmitter like BitPesa it can be converted into M-Pesa in Kenyan shillings.\nWhile bitcoin is on the rise, liquidity might still be a problem. As a commodity, can also be subject to greater volatility than currencies, though remittance companies say they combat this by immediately converting transfers.\nTransparency can also be an issue. Bitcoin users store a record on their computer of where every bitcoin is spent that acts as a virtual ledger Â– but the record does not show the identity of users. Â“From a law enforcement perspective, the danger is that the anonymity makes it an attractive proposition for criminals to use in terms of hiding the money trail we would use to get evidence against them,Â” Terence Chua, Singapore's deputy public prosecutor, told the Guardian.\nYears from now, people will be looking back to see how bitcoin expanded and be shocked when they discover a large percentage of its success stemmed from the middle of Africa outward.

There are *zero* occurrences of 'bitcoin' on the 'How it works' page. So maybe that Bitcoin invested people are perceiving it as a competing crypto, aka altcoin, and altcoins justifiably got a bad name on this forum because of what I'd call the \"shitcoin spree\" in 2014.\nSecond is that what I call the noise on this forum has increased significantly during the last two years, compared to what I experienced when I started posting here in early 2013. Let me define it shortly: I call 'signal' people exchanging ideas and information about Bitcoin. I call 'noise' people trolling, those who see bitcoin as a get-rich-quick thingie, those who want to earn $$$ without working, etc. Unfortunately, the signal-to-noise ratio has gone much lower when Bitcoin prices started to explode (it was $27 when I joined).\nSo, it might be genius or stupid, I can't really say at this stage.

I totally understand that. I don't think the outcome would have been different though if stake holders could have voted.\nBut none of these things are particularly relevant to my point.Â  Â I have invested in companies before where I did not agree with every decision of management.Â  It is par for the course. And if you feel you were \"robbed\" in some way I understand the resentment of course.Â  I had a similar thing with bitshares early on I wanted to mine pts, but I could not get the qt to run on my mac and had to watch others mining free coin easily while I got nothing.Â  Â It pissed me off, but that was just petty on my part.\nThe only question that matters now is: Does the current state of the bitshares open source protocol provide exciting tools that can help increase bitcoin's utility?\nThat is the question no nay-sayers have answered and its the only one that counts.... at least to me.\nJesus I appreciate you put a lot of effort into your reply, but I could not follow it I am afraid.

Elizabeth Rossiello, chief executive of BitPesa, told the BBC that a shortage of payment options in Africa is driving bitcoin use.\nItÂ’s also cheaper: that 3 per cent fee contrasts sharply with an average 12.3 per cent paid to money transmitters by Africans living abroad, according to figures by the Overseas Development Institute. The ODI said that total annual fees to money transmitters amount to $1.4 billion.\nIn some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, MoneyGram and Western Union control 50 per cent of the remittance market while credit cards are available to less than 3 per cent of the population. Other web solutions like PayPal are not widespread and can also be expensive. Bank transfers are no better Â– they can be two the three times as expensive as other countries.\nAfrica is fertile ground for bitcoin. It has history with mobile money services that allow users to pay for good using a mobile phone as an alternative to cash or cards. A mobile money service called M-Pesa is now so widespread in Kenya that almost 70 per cent of the volume of all national payments is made through the service.\nToby Shapshak, a technology journalist, said that M-Pesa has become a financial institution in its own right. Â“You can pay school fees, you can buy groceries, IÂ’m told you can even bribe customs officials using MPesa. The most important thing is that you can do it on the most basic of cell phone because Africa isnÂ’t a smart phone continent yet,Â” Shapshak told the Guardian.\nBitcoin works with this local economy. Once it is received by a transmitter like BitPesa it can be converted into M-Pesa in Kenyan shillings.\nWhile bitcoin is on the rise, liquidity might still be a problem. As a commodity, can also be subject to greater volatility than currencies, though remittance companies say they combat this by immediately converting transfers.\nTransparency can also be an issue. Bitcoin users store a record on their computer of where every bitcoin is spent that acts as a virtual ledger Â– but the record does not show the identity of users. Â“From a law enforcement perspective, the danger is that the anonymity makes it an attractive proposition for criminals to use in terms of hiding the money trail we would use to get evidence against them,Â” Terence Chua, Singapore's deputy public prosecutor, told the Guardian.\n", "views": 1844, "author": "shogdite Hero Member Offline Activity: 798 Merit: 1000 LIR Dev. www.letitride.io ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfrican migrants using Bitcoin to send money home\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-03-10 14:10:13", "content": "Is The Guardian citing a prosecutor from a country that hands out death penalties for victimless crimes as a way of saying that Bitcoin should be more anonymous than it is?\n", "author": "FeedbackLoop Hero Member Offline Activity: 742 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-03-10 17:03:34", "content": "All these people that are fucked by day 0 because of the bad luck of being born on a shithole of a country deserve to do better and Bitcoin is finally a way to give these people a realistic chance at generating wealth, specially when blockchain is accessible through SMS soon.\nIt will be huge.

Elizabeth Rossiello, chief executive of BitPesa, told the BBC that a shortage of payment options in Africa is driving bitcoin use.\nItÂ’s also cheaper: that 3 per cent fee contrasts sharply with an average 12.3 per cent paid to money transmitters by Africans living abroad, according to figures by the Overseas Development Institute. The ODI said that total annual fees to money transmitters amount to $1.4 billion.\nIn some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, MoneyGram and Western Union control 50 per cent of the remittance market while credit cards are available to less than 3 per cent of the population. Other web solutions like PayPal are not widespread and can also be expensive. Bank transfers are no better Â– they can be two the three times as expensive as other countries.\nAfrica is fertile ground for bitcoin. It has history with mobile money services that allow users to pay for good using a mobile phone as an alternative to cash or cards. A mobile money service called M-Pesa is now so widespread in Kenya that almost 70 per cent of the volume of all national payments is made through the service.\nToby Shapshak, a technology journalist, said that M-Pesa has become a financial institution in its own right. Â“You can pay school fees, you can buy groceries, IÂ’m told you can even bribe customs officials using MPesa. The most important thing is that you can do it on the most basic of cell phone because Africa isnÂ’t a smart phone continent yet,Â” Shapshak told the Guardian.\nBitcoin works with this local economy. Once it is received by a transmitter like BitPesa it can be converted into M-Pesa in Kenyan shillings.\nWhile bitcoin is on the rise, liquidity might still be a problem. As a commodity, can also be subject to greater volatility than currencies, though remittance companies say they combat this by immediately converting transfers.\nTransparency can also be an issue. Bitcoin users store a record on their computer of where every bitcoin is spent that acts as a virtual ledger Â– but the record does not show the identity of users. Â“From a law enforcement perspective, the danger is that the anonymity makes it an attractive proposition for criminals to use in terms of hiding the money trail we would use to get evidence against them,Â” Terence Chua, Singapore's deputy public prosecutor, told the Guardian.\nYears from now, people will be looking back to see how bitcoin expanded and be shocked when they discover a large percentage of its success stemmed from the middle of Africa outward.
