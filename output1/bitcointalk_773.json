Bitcoin, anonymous decentralized p2p by design, allows people to solve social problems in a novel way: Instead of the ancient formula of the strongest wins and then beats the crap out of the loser we all can achieve a peaceful society where both rich and poor, strong and weak can protect their property and freedom on more equal grounds without relying so much on violent institutions like governments.\n3) Smart contracts could change the ideological motivations of politicians for the better of people. When successful they can reduce dependence on law enforcement as well as losses to fraud and cracking.  Political smart contracts could enable protecting and enhancing the freedom of the individual to be the central problem of politics. Certain political decisions of elected officials could even be included in a smart contract. It could prevent the loop holes that politicians use to lie and hurt the common people. Example: If the politician states \"elect me and no new taxes\" the smart contract could monitor the tax figures for change and print out a \"pink slip\" for the politician if he does indeed raise taxes.\n", "author": "Billbags Sr. Member Offline Activity: 280 Merit: 250 Brainwashed this way "}], "date": "2014-10-21 14:40:59"}], "posts": [{"content": "I'm just curious after reading through some of the older archives here, for the users who are still currently active with BTC and how long most have been using it could be easy to tell your time in with comparing what you use BTC first and what it was used for last....
