There are some obvious possibilities people have mentioned:\n1. Sell some bitcoins for fiat currencies. One big problem is this usually requires an invasion of your privacy. For example, many exchanges require a lot of information before you can use them and especially before you can withdraw fiat.\n2. Sell some bitcoins for a fiat balance and leave it as a balance on the exchange. When you want the funds back, exchange back to bitcoin and withdraw. This is essentially what Coinapult locks do, but you could also use an exchange that doesn't require KYC for crypto-only use. One big problem is that the exchange could go out of business or simply refuse you access to your funds.\nUsing a little basic algebra, I described a way multisig could be used to buy and sell volatility risk.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1102062\nEssentially Alice and Bob can both put $100 worth of bitcoins into a multisig address where each has one private key. The same tx could have an OP_RETURN with a contract they both signed that says: Alice gets $100 worth of these bitcoins next week and Bob gets the rest. (If the price drops by more than half, then it's a \"black swan\" event and Alice gets all of it, but it's worth less than $100.) Unless there's a \"black swan\" event a week later Alice will have $100 worth of bitcoins. Bob would profit more if the price went up and lose more if the price went down. Essentially, Alice would be selling her volatility risk to Bob.\nThe advantage of this is that you don't give up total control of your bitcoins. A disadvantage is that if either Alice or Bob is incapacitated, the funds are lost. This disadvantage can be mitigated by having a 2-of-3 address where the third key is essentially an escrow agent, but then you have to hope the escrow agent isn't secretly either Alice or Bob.\nThis is all theoretical. I was hoping if I described it someone else would implement it. Lately I've been thinking about doing it myself. I'd probably do it with Clams instead of Bitcoin though. Clams has support for a \"speech\" part of a tx, and a node for Clams can reasonably be run on a VPS.\n", "author": "Trent Russell Full Member Offline Activity: 132 Merit: 100 willmathforcrypto.com "}], "date": "2015-11-29 23:09:33"}, {"content": "This topic has been moved to\nCurrency exchange\n.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1272048.0\n", "views": 178, "author": "Lauda Legendary Offline Activity: 1974 Merit: 1585 GUNBOT Licenses up to 70% OFF - 'GrumpyKitty'.

Blockchain has nothing to do with the power of Central Banks of every country. Blockchain will not replace the national currency which is managed by the Central Bank. Blockchain can help in the more fruitful managment of this national currency. Will help the commercial banks to have less costs in managing this currency. Blockchain cannot be used from the commercial banks to create other coins which can put in risk the national currency and decrease or put in risk the role of the Central Bank of one country. Have no power to do this (by law) and even no interests. The only Authority which can produce/create/stamp new money/currency in one country is the Central Bank (or the similar Authority of it) of that country. So, even in this way, any kind of risk cannot be seen.\nIt is another thing if we talk about bitcoin. Bitcoin, if not controlled, can ever \"destroy\" (put out of effective monetary policies) one Central Bank if we are talking about countries with weak economy or undeveloped ones. Bitcoin can put in risk even other important economies but that are in crisis. The most clear example is Russia which has banned it exactly for this reason. The fear from it, from its increasing power. But which was unable to do the people to leave or abandon bitcoin. In Russia the bitcoin black market have sizes which create concerns to the Russian Government. Not surprisingly one of the members of Russian Government propose to put in jail all those who have to do or use bitcoin.\nAs for the use of bitcoin as a reserve in the Central Banks this is a big step ahead. But there must be much more before. Maybe I am not well informed but no one country has known bitcoin as a currency. How is possible then to be considered the option of being reserve currency in a Central Bank?\n", "author": "n2004al Legendary Offline Activity: 1050 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-11-30 11:32:28", "content": "This is true positive steps that bitcoin is looking for.

Thanks in advance!\nFirst it is a debit card and not a credit card. Are big differences between both. Even that this depends from the \"rights\" given to the debit card which some times make it practically like a credit card (at least in the use). For example normally the debit card must be used only at ATM's to take your money and that's all. But some banks give such cards even the right to buy at internet or at the POS, quality these of credit cards.\nAs for the fees and the lack of other info you have totally right. Is not correct issue such tool and not give its costs or other qualities connected with that which are very important. This seems a trick to distribute as many as it will be possible using the marketing and the good name of the business. But is not a fair behavior. I am a user of Coinbase and like it as a customer. Give quality and low costs for the services I use (wallet) and give good prices in the buy and sell of bitcoin. So, if will continue in this way even this card must be competitive compared with the others actually at market or which can be created.\n", "author": "n2004al Legendary Offline Activity: 1050 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-11-26 17:44:45", "content": "I have a couple of questions about using a credit card on Coinbase:\nWhat types of cards do they accept?

With this payment method, you will not have to pre-fund your account to buy bitcoin. You can purchase bitcoin instantly without waiting for a bank transfer to complete.\nTo determine if your card supports 3D Secure, you can contact your credit/debit card provider directly or simply try adding it to your Coinbase account. You will get an error message if your card does not support 3D Secure. Some banks will require various security steps to authorize a purchase using 3D Secure. Some of the methods you may see will be a text message, a bank provided security card, or security questions.\nThis method is\nnot available for customers outside of Europe and the UK\n. For help with instant purchases in the US, please refer to the following article: How does Coinbase use my credit card?\nSoooo.... continuing to U.S. Customers:\nSOURCE:\nhttps://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1913170\nEXCERPT:\nHow does Coinbase use my credit card?\nOct 09, 2015\nThis article is\nfor US based customers\n.\nAfter verifying your VISA or MasterCard credit card, the instant buy option becomes available. When you place an instant buy order, Coinbase runs an authorization check with your card provider before processing the order.\nYour credit card is not charged for instant buy orders. Instant buy orders use the same ACH payment method applied to standard purchases from your bank account\n. This enables Coinbase to offer instant buys with the same low 1% fee.\n​If the payment from your bank fails\nfor any reason, Coinbase will attempt to reclaim lost funds from your Coinbase bitcoin wallet. If your bitcoin wallet balance is insufficient to cover this,\nthe credit card is charged for the outstanding amount. Coinbase assesses an additional fee of 2.96% on transactions where your primary payment method fails and your credit card must be charged to complete your purchase. An additional cash advance / ATM fee may be applied by your bank\n, depending on your agreement with them.\n", "author": "keepdoing Full Member Offline Activity: 140 Merit: 101 "}, {"date": "2015-11-26 19:34:52", "content": "I have a couple of questions about using a credit card on Coinbase:\nWhat types of cards do they accept?

Its a technology that allows people who dont know each other to trust a shared record of events. And its potential wont just impact financial services. Many believe that blockchain could track and verify almost any digital record.\nA host of possibilities\nBlockchains distributed ledger technology already maintains the Bitcoin network, and keeps a record of all Bitcoin transactions. Its underpinning a new land title registry system in Honduras so people can prove they own the land theyve bought. Its enabling universities to store and encrypt student qualification records so employers can instantly verify CVs. Its helping insurance companies crack down on fraud and theft by giving diamonds a digital fingerprint, creating a public ledger that tracks the origin, sale and ownership of the worlds most precious stones.\nAnd many more novel applications are bubbling under.

This has no meaning and not their initiative to reward who have idea how to implement this technology. This is an over open mind initiative, according to me, which must be followed by who can and who want to give something to the progress itself. Independently in which field of activity act. Because no one can know where can \"born\" the new idea about the implementation of peer to peer. And the idea is only the beginning. Without funding cannot be done nothing.

There are some obvious possibilities people have mentioned:\n1. Sell some bitcoins for fiat currencies. One big problem is this usually requires an invasion of your privacy. For example, many exchanges require a lot of information before you can use them and especially before you can withdraw fiat.\n2. Sell some bitcoins for a fiat balance and leave it as a balance on the exchange. When you want the funds back, exchange back to bitcoin and withdraw. This is essentially what Coinapult locks do, but you could also use an exchange that doesn't require KYC for crypto-only use. One big problem is that the exchange could go out of business or simply refuse you access to your funds.\nUsing a little basic algebra, I described a way multisig could be used to buy and sell volatility risk.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1102062\nEssentially Alice and Bob can both put $100 worth of bitcoins into a multisig address where each has one private key. The same tx could have an OP_RETURN with a contract they both signed that says: Alice gets $100 worth of these bitcoins next week and Bob gets the rest. (If the price drops by more than half, then it's a \"black swan\" event and Alice gets all of it, but it's worth less than $100.) Unless there's a \"black swan\" event a week later Alice will have $100 worth of bitcoins. Bob would profit more if the price went up and lose more if the price went down. Essentially, Alice would be selling her volatility risk to Bob.\nThe advantage of this is that you don't give up total control of your bitcoins. A disadvantage is that if either Alice or Bob is incapacitated, the funds are lost. This disadvantage can be mitigated by having a 2-of-3 address where the third key is essentially an escrow agent, but then you have to hope the escrow agent isn't secretly either Alice or Bob.\nThis is all theoretical. I was hoping if I described it someone else would implement it. Lately I've been thinking about doing it myself. I'd probably do it with Clams instead of Bitcoin though. Clams has support for a \"speech\" part of a tx, and a node for Clams can reasonably be run on a VPS.\n", "author": "Trent Russell Full Member Offline Activity: 132 Merit: 100 willmathforcrypto.com "}], "date": "2015-11-29 23:09:33"}, {"content": "This topic has been moved to\nCurrency exchange\n.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1272048.0\n", "views": 178, "author": "Lauda Legendary Offline Activity: 1974 Merit: 1585 GUNBOT Licenses up to 70% OFF - 'GrumpyKitty'.

Blockchain has nothing to do with the power of Central Banks of every country. Blockchain will not replace the national currency which is managed by the Central Bank. Blockchain can help in the more fruitful managment of this national currency. Will help the commercial banks to have less costs in managing this currency. Blockchain cannot be used from the commercial banks to create other coins which can put in risk the national currency and decrease or put in risk the role of the Central Bank of one country. Have no power to do this (by law) and even no interests. The only Authority which can produce/create/stamp new money/currency in one country is the Central Bank (or the similar Authority of it) of that country. So, even in this way, any kind of risk cannot be seen.\nIt is another thing if we talk about bitcoin. Bitcoin, if not controlled, can ever \"destroy\" (put out of effective monetary policies) one Central Bank if we are talking about countries with weak economy or undeveloped ones. Bitcoin can put in risk even other important economies but that are in crisis. The most clear example is Russia which has banned it exactly for this reason. The fear from it, from its increasing power. But which was unable to do the people to leave or abandon bitcoin. In Russia the bitcoin black market have sizes which create concerns to the Russian Government. Not surprisingly one of the members of Russian Government propose to put in jail all those who have to do or use bitcoin.\nAs for the use of bitcoin as a reserve in the Central Banks this is a big step ahead. But there must be much more before. Maybe I am not well informed but no one country has known bitcoin as a currency. How is possible then to be considered the option of being reserve currency in a Central Bank?\n", "author": "n2004al Legendary Offline Activity: 1050 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-11-30 11:32:28", "content": "This is true positive steps that bitcoin is looking for.

As for other countries feeling the impact, it wouldn't really matter unless Barbados benefits from Bitcoin in some large way.\n", "author": "Yakamoto Legendary Offline Activity: 1120 Merit: 1004 "}], "date": "2015-11-29 22:26:49"}, {"content": "Once again my attempt to summarize and explain the weekly bitcoin developer meeting in layman's terms.\nLink to last weeks summarization\nDisclaimer\nPlease bear in mind I'm not a developer and I'd have problems coding \"hello world!\", so some things might be incorrect or plain wrong.\nLike any other write-up it likely contains personal biases, although I try to stay as neutral as I can.\nThere are no decisions being made in these meetings, so if I say \"everyone agrees\" this means everyone present in the meeting, that's not consensus, but since a fair amount of devs are present it's a good representation.\nThe dev IRC and mailinglist are for bitcoin development purposes. If you have not contributed actual code to a bitcoin-implementation, this is probably not the place you want to reach out to. There are many places to discuss things that the developers read, including this forum.\nlink to this week logs\nMeeting minutes by meetbot\nMain topics discussed where:\nCLTV activation\nBIP68/BIP112 implementation\nReplace-by-fee\nShort topics/notes\nIt was an American holiday (thanksgiving), so there weren't a lot of people in the meeting, which started later as well.\nPersonal note: My weekly posts are being read by more people than I ever anticipated and people are expecting these to come weekly.\nNext year Mid-February I'll be on vacation for a month, so that's 4 or 5 meetings I won't be able to do.\nIf there's anyone who's up for the challenge to take over during those weeks (or maybe just 1 week and share the load with others) feel free to pm me.\nI'm announcing well in advance, so there's more chance to find someone and to not make this a last minute thing.\nI'd prefer someone who doesn't work in the bitcoin space (coding), as I much rather have people work on the future of money instead of enlightening us noobs\nCLTV activation\n- background\nCheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) aka \"how you thought nLockTime worked before you actually tried to use it\" aka OP_HODL.\n- meeting comments\nIt's plausible the CLTV softfork will activate within just a few weeks, as everyone but a few big miners have adopted it.\nAbout 20% of the nodes currently run CLTV-supporting versions. The negative effect of not upgrading is a degraded validation (SPV).\n- meeting conclusion\nDo a social media reminder to upgrade nodes to v0.11.2/v0.10.4\nBIP68/BIP112 implementation\n- background\nBIP 68\nConsensus-enforced transaction replacement signaled via sequence numbers , and current\nimplementation\n.\nBIP 112\nCHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, and current\nimplementation\n.\nIn short: BIP 68 changes the meaning of the sequence number field to a relative locktime. BIP 112 makes that field accessible to the bitcoin scripting system.\n- meeting comments\nThe BIP68 and BIP112 texts have been updated to match the implementations.\nThere's been a call and discussion to rename CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY on the\nmailinglist\n.\nbtcdrak wants both pull-requests to be merged soon, others feel more hesitant as people seem to only recently started looking at it seriously.\n- meeting conclusion\nMerge updated BIP-texts\nReplace-by-fee\n- background\nCurrently when a node sees a transaction that spends the same output it ignores it. With replace-by-fee it replaces the current transaction in the mempool if it has a higher fee.\nThis allows for things like spending \"stuck\" transactions, adding more recipients to a transaction in order to prevent chaining, etc.\nSince there are people that accept 0-confirmation transactions and this would make it extremely easy to double spend them, this is made opt-in.\nThe sender can choose to opt-in to replace-by-fee by changing the nSequence field of all inputs.\nThis is a mempool policy for the upcoming 0.12 release.\nThere's a good\nFAQ-ish post\non reddit about it.\n- meeting comments\npetertodd ran some tests with the mempool limiter turned way down and saw no issues.\nIt should be technically easy to merge first-seen-safe and full-unconditional as options if there's people who want to write it.\n- meeting conclusion\ntest and ACK\nreplace-by-fee\n(Has been merged meanwhile).\nParticipants\nCode:\nbtcdrak      btcdrak\npetertodd    Peter Todd\nLuke-Jr      Luke Dashjr\nCodeShark    Eric Lombrozo\nsipa         Pieter Wuille\njtimon       Jorge Timón\nComic relief\nCode:\n19:17\nbtcdrak\nwumpus: so no meeting today then?\n19:17\nCodeShark\nbtcdrak: so no wumpus today then? :)\n19:17\npetertodd\nbtcdrak: since when do you listen to authority? :P\n19:22\nCodeShark\nis there a quorum? or can we meet anyhow? :)\n19:22\npetertodd\nCodeShark: I'm in a mcdonalds right now, working on increasing my influence, as measured by mass...\n19:22\npetertodd\nCodeShark: so yes\n19:49\nbtcdrak\n### 10 minutes left. are there any other topic suggestions?\n19:50\npetertodd\nbtcdrak: rbf\n19:50\nbtcdrak\n#topic RBF\n19:51\nCodeShark\nanyone have a topic that pays a higher fee? :)\n19:51\nLuke-Jr\nthis fee is too low, I'm leaving early!\n19:24\nbtcdrak\n#meetingstart\n19:24\nbtcdrak\n#startmeeting\n19:24\nlightningbot\nMeeting started Thu Nov 26 19:24:40 2015 UTC.

Thanks in advance!\nFirst it is a debit card and not a credit card. Are big differences between both. Even that this depends from the \"rights\" given to the debit card which some times make it practically like a credit card (at least in the use). For example normally the debit card must be used only at ATM's to take your money and that's all. But some banks give such cards even the right to buy at internet or at the POS, quality these of credit cards.\nAs for the fees and the lack of other info you have totally right. Is not correct issue such tool and not give its costs or other qualities connected with that which are very important. This seems a trick to distribute as many as it will be possible using the marketing and the good name of the business. But is not a fair behavior. I am a user of Coinbase and like it as a customer. Give quality and low costs for the services I use (wallet) and give good prices in the buy and sell of bitcoin. So, if will continue in this way even this card must be competitive compared with the others actually at market or which can be created.\n", "author": "n2004al Legendary Offline Activity: 1050 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-11-26 17:44:45", "content": "I have a couple of questions about using a credit card on Coinbase:\nWhat types of cards do they accept?

With this payment method, you will not have to pre-fund your account to buy bitcoin. You can purchase bitcoin instantly without waiting for a bank transfer to complete.\nTo determine if your card supports 3D Secure, you can contact your credit/debit card provider directly or simply try adding it to your Coinbase account. You will get an error message if your card does not support 3D Secure. Some banks will require various security steps to authorize a purchase using 3D Secure. Some of the methods you may see will be a text message, a bank provided security card, or security questions.\nThis method is\nnot available for customers outside of Europe and the UK\n. For help with instant purchases in the US, please refer to the following article: How does Coinbase use my credit card?\nSoooo.... continuing to U.S. Customers:\nSOURCE:\nhttps://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1913170\nEXCERPT:\nHow does Coinbase use my credit card?\nOct 09, 2015\nThis article is\nfor US based customers\n.\nAfter verifying your VISA or MasterCard credit card, the instant buy option becomes available. When you place an instant buy order, Coinbase runs an authorization check with your card provider before processing the order.\nYour credit card is not charged for instant buy orders. Instant buy orders use the same ACH payment method applied to standard purchases from your bank account\n. This enables Coinbase to offer instant buys with the same low 1% fee.\n​If the payment from your bank fails\nfor any reason, Coinbase will attempt to reclaim lost funds from your Coinbase bitcoin wallet. If your bitcoin wallet balance is insufficient to cover this,\nthe credit card is charged for the outstanding amount. Coinbase assesses an additional fee of 2.96% on transactions where your primary payment method fails and your credit card must be charged to complete your purchase. An additional cash advance / ATM fee may be applied by your bank\n, depending on your agreement with them.\n", "author": "keepdoing Full Member Offline Activity: 140 Merit: 101 "}, {"date": "2015-11-26 19:34:52", "content": "I have a couple of questions about using a credit card on Coinbase:\nWhat types of cards do they accept?
