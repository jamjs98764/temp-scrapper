One would have expected gold to get at least a little boost from the crisis, yet it continued it's downward trend, seemingly completely unaffected by the Greek crisis.\nBitcoin on the other hand experienced notable boosts, you can actually track significant spikes in the price of bitcoin against certain days when Greece made decisions or certain events happened in Greece that caused people to look for alternative stores of value and currency.\nThis has me wondering if bitcoin is affecting gold. Gold has been declining in price ever since 2012. It seems to be that for the past 5000 years gold has been valuable because it was the ultimate form of value storage on the planet, and a pretty good currency, making it the best money on the planet. Without it's use as store of value and money, if those utilities are removed from it's value and price, it's intrinsic value as just an industrial metal is minuscule in comparison.\nNow that bitcoin is on the scene, it seems that gold is no longer the ultimate store of value nor the ultimate money on the planet. Bitcoin improves on the things which make gold a good store of value and at the same time integrates improvements on the medium of exchange features of paper money making it not only a superior store of value, but also a superior currency or medium of exchange, making bitcoin the best money on the planet.\nIf bitcoin is now the ultimate money on the planet, will this cause gold to crash to it's intrinsic value as an industrial metal used in circuitry and jewelry?\n", "views": 5663, "author": "BitProdigy Full Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 100 We Are The New Wealthy Elite, Gentlemen ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCould Bitcoin Crash Gold?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-07-23 06:52:08", "content": "If bitcoin is now the ultimate money on the planet, will this cause gold to crash to it's intrinsic value as an industrial metal used in circuitry and jewelry?\nNo.\nStupid mainstream media now says (like many times before) : \"Gold is dead\"\n-&gt; you should buy gold (&amp;\nBTC\n)\n", "author": "LiteCoinGuy Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1001 In Satoshi I Trust "}, {"date": "2015-07-23 06:59:32", "content": "I don't think Bitcoin has reached \"ultimate money on the planet\" status.\nI think the trends you're noticing are a coincidence. The volume of bitcoin users or transactions is still very, very small compared to fiat currency transactions. And because bitcoin's transaction volume is so relatively small it doesn't take as much activity to move the price a greater swing one way or the other. A bunch of us on this forum talk about the Greek currency crisis, theorize how bitcoin would be the safe alternative, buy some more bitcoin anticipating a possible run, and then see that run up (due to our cycle of conversation.)\nIt's possible that the rest of the world didn't see any need to \"flock to gold\" because all the other fiat currencies are (relatively) stable, not linked to the Greek currency success or failure. And the people of Greece can't easily move their money to gold anyway, given the austerity measures that were already in place.\nAlso, Gold\nis\npriced at its intrinsic value if the current price is what people believe its worth, if the market value equals its perceived true value. I.e., if people believe that gold is really scarce (and not just supply-controlled by jewelry companies) then it's current value is its intrinsic value.\n", "author": "Possum577 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 434 Merit: 250 Loose lips sink sigs!

The qualities that make anything a sound money are in general store of value, medium of exchange, fungibility, unit of account, divisibility, and portability.\nBitcoin is superior to gold on a purely technical standpoint as money because gold is inherently flawed in the fact that it cannot realistically stand alone as it's own form of currency. Consider someone buying a multimillion dollar house with gold, are they going to load up a truck with all the gold and drive it to the sellers vault? How long does that take and how much does that cost? How would you buy a book on amazon.com with gold? Are you going to mail some gold coins to amazon's headquarters?\nIn order to use gold, a currency must always be created which acts as a receipt for gold, or a gold certificate which is redeemable in gold, or a bank note that you can trade and which can be redeemed in gold, that solves the problem of gold's difficulty as a medium of exchange. This inherent weakness in gold which necessitates the creation of certificates receipts and bank notes is what makes it inferior to bitcoin.\nBitcoin has the value storage capacity of gold because of it's scarcity and the rate at which it is generated, but includes the best form of medium of exchange we have ever seen so that there is no need to produce receipts, certificates, notes that are more easily tradable. Bitcoin is already easily tradable, unlike gold, and even improves on golds value storage capacity because of it's definite predictable certain scarcity. It is the ultimate sound money therefore.\nHistory shows that when certificates for gold are printed, or some currency is created that is backed by gold, there is no way to prevent more of them being printed than exists gold that backs them up, this causes bank runs, economic instability, eventually only partial redeem ability of the notes in gold, and inevitably purely fiat money that is no longer backed by gold.

This could turn out to be very expensive, but if it was possible, the price of gold could collapse.\nOnce private companies like Virgin and Ellon Musk get the hang of space flight, they could invest in cheaper methods to do space exploration and mining and this might happen way faster than we think.\nSo if all these impossible things happen and the gold price fall through it's ass... Bitcoin might be seen as a better store of value. {We know only 21 000 000 coins would ever exist}\nso gold is not even a good store of value, because in theory, based on this revelation there can be infinite gold in the universe, maybe far away in the universe, scientists could discover a better element than gold that can be used more in the industry, one never know\n", "author": "TinEye Hero Member Offline Activity: 640 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-07-30 12:39:49", "content": "I think that would be impossible.

Solid state electronic devices use very low voltages and currents which are easily interrupted by corrosion or tarnish at the contact points. Gold is the highly efficient conductor that can carry these tiny currents and remain free of corrosion. Electronic components made with gold are highly reliable. Gold is used in connectors, switch and relay contacts, soldered joints, connecting wires and connection strips.\nA small amount of gold is used in almost every sophisticated electronic device. This includes: cell phones, calculators, personal digital assistants, global positioning system units and other small electronic devices. Most large electronic appliances such as television sets also contain gold.\nOne challenge with the use of gold in very small quantities in very small devices is loss of the metal from society. Nearly one billion cell phones are produced each year and most of them contain about fifty cents worth of gold. Their average lifetime is under two years and very few are currently recycled. Although the amount of gold is small in each device, their enormous numbers translate into a lot of unrecycled gold.\nUse of Gold in Computers\nGold is used in many places in the standard desktop or laptop computer. The rapid and accurate transmission of digital information through the computer and from one component to another requires an efficient and reliable conductor. Gold meets these requirements better than any other metal. The importance of high quality and reliable performance justifies the high cost.\nEdge connectors used to mount microprocessor and memory chips onto the motherboard and the plug-and-socket connectors used to attach cables all contain gold. The gold in these components is generally electroplated onto other metals and alloyed with small amounts of nickel or cobalt to increase durability.\nUse of Gold in Dentistry\nHow would iron work as a dental filling? Not very well... your dentist would need blacksmithing tools, your smile would be rusty a few days after a filling and you would need to get used to the taste of iron. Even at much higher expense, gold is used in dentistry because of its superior performance and aesthetic appeal. Gold alloys are used for fillings, crowns, bridges and orthodontic appliances. Gold is used in dentistry because it is chemically inert, nonallergenic and easy for the dentist to work.\nGold is known to have been used in dentistry as early as 700 B.C. Etruscan \"dentists\" used gold wire to fasten replacement teeth into the mouths of their patients. Gold was probably used to fill cavities in ancient times, however there is no documentation or archaeological evidence for this use of gold until a little over 1000 years ago.\nGold was much more generously used in dentistry up until the late 1970's. The sharp run-up of gold prices at that time motivated the development of substitute materials. However, the amount of gold used in dentistry is starting to rise again. Some motivation for this comes from concerns that less inert metals might have an adverse effect on long-term health.\nMedical Uses of Gold\nGold is used as a drug to treat a small number of medical conditions. Injections of weak solutions of sodium aurothiomalate or aurothioglucose are sometimes used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Particles of a radioactive gold isotope are implanted in tissues to serve as a radiation source in the treatment of certain cancers.\nSmall amounts of gold are used to remedy a condition known as Lagophthalmos, which is an inability of a person to close their eyes completely. This condition is treated by implanting small amounts of gold in the upper eyelid. The implanted gold \"weights\" the eyelid and the force of gravity helps the eyelid close fully.\nRadioactive gold is used in diagnosis. It is injected in a colloidal solution that can be tracked as a beta emitter as it passes through the body. Many surgical instruments, electronic equipment and life-support devices are made using small amounts of gold. Gold is nonreactive in the instruments and is highly reliable in the electronic equipment and life-support devices.\nUses of Gold in Aerospace\nIf you are going to spend billions of dollars on a vehicle that when launched will travel on a voyage where the possibility of lubrication, maintenance and repair is absolutely zero, then building it with extremely dependable materials is essential. This is exactly why gold is used in hundreds of ways in every space vehicle that NASA launches.\nGold is used in circuitry because it is a dependable conductor and connector. In addition, many parts of every space vehicle are fitted with gold-coated polyester film. This film reflects infrared radiation and helps stabilize the temperature of the spacecraft. Without this coating, dark colored parts of the spacecraft would absorb significant amounts of heat\nGold is also used as a lubricant between mechanical parts. In the vacuum of space, organic lubricants would volatilize and they would be broken down by the intense radiation beyond Earth's atmosphere. Gold has a very low shear strength and thin films of gold between critical moving parts serves as a lubricant - the gold molecules slip past one another under the forces of friction and that provides a lubricant action.\nUses of Gold Awards &amp; Status Symbols\nWhat metal is used to make the crown worn by a king? Gold! This metal is selected for use because gold it is THE metal of highest esteem. It would make no sense to make a king's crown out of steel - even though steel is the strongest metal. Gold is chosen for use in a king's crown because it is the metal associated with highest esteem and status.\nGold is associated with many positive qualities. Purity is another quality associated with gold. For this reason, gold is the metal of choice for religious objects. Crosses, communion ware and other religious symbols are almost always made with gold for this reason.\nGold is also used as the first place winner's medal or trophy in almost any type of contest. First place winners at the Olympic Games are given gold medals. The Academy Awards Oscars are gold awards. Music's Grammy Awards are made of gold. All of these important achievements are honored with awards made of gold.\nUses of Gold in Glassmaking\nGold has many uses in the production of glass. The most basic use in glassmaking is that of a pigment. A small amount of gold suspended in the glass when it is annealed produces a rich ruby color.\nGold is also used when making specialty glass for climate controlled buildings and cases. A small amount of gold dispersed within the glass or coated onto the glass surface will reflect solar radiation outward, helping the buildings stay cool in the summer, and reflect internal heat inward, helping them stay warm in winter.\nThe visor on the helmet of an astronaut's space suit is coated with a very thin film of gold. This thin film reflects much of the very intense solar radiation of space, protecting the astronaut's eyes and skin.\nGold Gilding and Gold Leaf\nGold has the highest malleability of any metal. This enables gold to be beaten into sheets that are only a few millionths of an inch thick. These thin sheets, known as \"gold leaf\" can be applied over the irregular surfaces of picture frames, molding or furniture.\nGold leaf is also used on the external and internal surfaces of buildings. This provides a durable and corrosion-resistant covering. One of the most eye-catching uses of gold leaf is on the domes of religious buildings and other important structures. The cost of this \"roofing material\" is very high per square foot; however, the cost of the gold is only a few percent of the total project cost. Most of the cost goes to the labor of highly skilled artisans who apply the gold leaf.\nFuture Uses of Gold\nGold is too expensive to use by chance. Instead it is used deliberately and only when less expensive substitutes can not be identified. As a result, once a use is found for gold it is rarely abandoned for another metal. This means that the number of uses for gold have been increasing over time.\nMost of the ways that gold is used today have been developed only during the last two or three decades. This trend will likely continue. As our society requires more sophisticated and reliable materials our uses for gold will increase. This combination of growing demand, few substitutes and limited supply will cause the value and importance of gold to increase steadily over time. It is truly a metal of the future.\nTL;DR\nGold is used in many different fields, in addition to the fact it's hard to get (mining etc.) there are many industrial uses.\nThus my stance remains, BTC may &gt; GOLD in the future, but it wont crash it\n", "author": "Aki4real Sr. Member Offline Activity: 336 Merit: 250 Let's change the world "}, {"date": "2015-07-31 20:21:23", "content": "No.\nPeople needs to physically hold their valuable things.

It seems to be that for the past 5000 years gold has been valuable because it was the ultimate form of value storage on the planet, and a pretty good currency, making it the best money on the planet. Without it's use as store of value and money, if those utilities are removed from it's value and price, it's intrinsic value as just an industrial metal is minuscule in comparison.\nNow that bitcoin is on the scene, it seems that gold is no longer the ultimate store of value nor the ultimate money on the planet. Bitcoin improves on the things which make gold a good store of value and at the same time integrates improvements on the medium of exchange features of paper money making it not only a superior store of value, but also a superior currency or medium of exchange, making bitcoin the best money on the planet.\nIf bitcoin is now the ultimate money on the planet, will this cause gold to crash to it's intrinsic value as an industrial metal used in circuitry and jewelry?\nFor a bitcoin future, bitcoin is easier to store than gold\n", "author": "Ilove-Obama Member Offline Activity: 98 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2015-08-14 22:32:59", "content": "Also if bitcoin is causing the price of gold to drop then surely this huge influx of new money would be causing the price of bitcoin to go parabolic instead of downwards.\nBitcoin price hasn't been 'going downwards' for quite a few months now.

The chain US must be enough secure: You either use other hashing solution to secure the network (and dilute the hash power for bitcoin network at mean time) or merge mine together with bitcoin (risk of double spending attack by other bitcoin hash power)\n2. In order to use those USbtc, merchant have to install another client to specifically work with it. There will be other side chains like EUbtc, AUbtc, CNbtc etc...  And since EUbtc is not spendable on USbtc network, vice versa, each merchant/exchange will install and maintain a whole bunch of different clients if they want to do business with its international customers. So unless all the side chains are invisible to end users through a single unique interface, the most likely outcome is that each country use its own side chain due to speed advantage in its domestic network\n3. If CNbtc grows a lot and there is a strong demand for CNbtc in china, this will cause its exchange rate to be higher than bitcoins on the main chain. Then there is a motivation to convert main chain bitcoins to CNbtc due to 1:1 peg.

At that point, CoinX has basically replaced Bitcoin.\nWhile some might view this as evolutionary, what if CoinX sacrificied certain principles, like being semi-anonymous and fungible.  Why would the masses flock to it if it made so many sacrifices?  The same reason most people pay with a credit/debit card today.\nThat said, if someone can come up with the holy grail of anonymizing transactions, they could create a very beneficial side-chain.  I've tried to think this through, yet found it very challenging because of the difficulty of achieving trustless at the network level.\nHere would be an interesting use-case for a side-chain, though.  The first eCommerce driver on the Internet was online gambling (next to maybe p0rn, which is basically free today).  Not surprisingly, there is plenty of bitcoin based online gambling today.  But, can you trust the casino not to cheat?\nWhat if a gambling side-chain published all its bets on a side chain?  You could not only verify that your bets were published, but do statistical analysis of ALL bets to verify the honesty of the casino.\nContrast that to moving your bitcoins to a casino, where you trust them with your bitcoins AND trust them to be honest, without any transparency or protection of your bitcoins.\nTo be sure, you could accomplish the bets chain today without changing bitcoin's protocol.

I never said that I disagree with him. My point was that just because he created BitTorrent that people should not expect his opinions to be correct all the time. He does make a decent point. However, I would rather we stop fighting the Core vs XT war. Even people presenting on the workshop have failed to stop this (e.g. Peter R adding slide related to XT).\nIt is beneficial I think, different opinions are unavoidable and there will always be unsolved tensions, so whoever wins the war will be the one that survives, which I hope is Core and at this point it's safe to say that no one really cares about XT and the problem will be solved within core through a BIP and implementation of the lightning network.\nThere is no actual problem\nright now\n.

Without it's use as store of value and money, if those utilities are removed from it's value and price, it's intrinsic value as just an industrial metal is minuscule in comparison.\nNow that bitcoin is on the scene, it seems that gold is no longer the ultimate store of value nor the ultimate money on the planet. Bitcoin improves on the things which make gold a good store of value and at the same time integrates improvements on the medium of exchange features of paper money making it not only a superior store of value, but also a superior currency or medium of exchange, making bitcoin the best money on the planet.\nIf bitcoin is now the ultimate money on the planet, will this cause gold to crash to it's intrinsic value as an industrial metal used in circuitry and jewelry?\n", "views": 5663, "author": "BitProdigy Full Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 100 We Are The New Wealthy Elite, Gentlemen ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCould Bitcoin Crash Gold?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-07-23 06:52:08", "content": "If bitcoin is now the ultimate money on the planet, will this cause gold to crash to it's intrinsic value as an industrial metal used in circuitry and jewelry?\nNo.\nStupid mainstream media now says (like many times before) : \"Gold is dead\"\n-&gt; you should buy gold (&amp;\nBTC\n)\n", "author": "LiteCoinGuy Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1001 In Satoshi I Trust "}, {"date": "2015-07-23 06:59:32", "content": "I don't think Bitcoin has reached \"ultimate money on the planet\" status.\nI think the trends you're noticing are a coincidence. The volume of bitcoin users or transactions is still very, very small compared to fiat currency transactions. And because bitcoin's transaction volume is so relatively small it doesn't take as much activity to move the price a greater swing one way or the other. A bunch of us on this forum talk about the Greek currency crisis, theorize how bitcoin would be the safe alternative, buy some more bitcoin anticipating a possible run, and then see that run up (due to our cycle of conversation.)\nIt's possible that the rest of the world didn't see any need to \"flock to gold\" because all the other fiat currencies are (relatively) stable, not linked to the Greek currency success or failure. And the people of Greece can't easily move their money to gold anyway, given the austerity measures that were already in place.\nAlso, Gold\nis\npriced at its intrinsic value if the current price is what people believe its worth, if the market value equals its perceived true value. I.e., if people believe that gold is really scarce (and not just supply-controlled by jewelry companies) then it's current value is its intrinsic value.\n", "author": "Possum577 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 434 Merit: 250 Loose lips sink sigs!

The qualities that make anything a sound money are in general store of value, medium of exchange, fungibility, unit of account, divisibility, and portability.\nBitcoin is superior to gold on a purely technical standpoint as money because gold is inherently flawed in the fact that it cannot realistically stand alone as it's own form of currency. Consider someone buying a multimillion dollar house with gold, are they going to load up a truck with all the gold and drive it to the sellers vault? How long does that take and how much does that cost? How would you buy a book on amazon.com with gold? Are you going to mail some gold coins to amazon's headquarters?\nIn order to use gold, a currency must always be created which acts as a receipt for gold, or a gold certificate which is redeemable in gold, or a bank note that you can trade and which can be redeemed in gold, that solves the problem of gold's difficulty as a medium of exchange. This inherent weakness in gold which necessitates the creation of certificates receipts and bank notes is what makes it inferior to bitcoin.\nBitcoin has the value storage capacity of gold because of it's scarcity and the rate at which it is generated, but includes the best form of medium of exchange we have ever seen so that there is no need to produce receipts, certificates, notes that are more easily tradable. Bitcoin is already easily tradable, unlike gold, and even improves on golds value storage capacity because of it's definite predictable certain scarcity. It is the ultimate sound money therefore.\nHistory shows that when certificates for gold are printed, or some currency is created that is backed by gold, there is no way to prevent more of them being printed than exists gold that backs them up, this causes bank runs, economic instability, eventually only partial redeem ability of the notes in gold, and inevitably purely fiat money that is no longer backed by gold.

Solid state electronic devices use very low voltages and currents which are easily interrupted by corrosion or tarnish at the contact points. Gold is the highly efficient conductor that can carry these tiny currents and remain free of corrosion. Electronic components made with gold are highly reliable. Gold is used in connectors, switch and relay contacts, soldered joints, connecting wires and connection strips.\nA small amount of gold is used in almost every sophisticated electronic device. This includes: cell phones, calculators, personal digital assistants, global positioning system units and other small electronic devices. Most large electronic appliances such as television sets also contain gold.\nOne challenge with the use of gold in very small quantities in very small devices is loss of the metal from society. Nearly one billion cell phones are produced each year and most of them contain about fifty cents worth of gold. Their average lifetime is under two years and very few are currently recycled. Although the amount of gold is small in each device, their enormous numbers translate into a lot of unrecycled gold.\nUse of Gold in Computers\nGold is used in many places in the standard desktop or laptop computer. The rapid and accurate transmission of digital information through the computer and from one component to another requires an efficient and reliable conductor. Gold meets these requirements better than any other metal. The importance of high quality and reliable performance justifies the high cost.\nEdge connectors used to mount microprocessor and memory chips onto the motherboard and the plug-and-socket connectors used to attach cables all contain gold. The gold in these components is generally electroplated onto other metals and alloyed with small amounts of nickel or cobalt to increase durability.\nUse of Gold in Dentistry\nHow would iron work as a dental filling? Not very well... your dentist would need blacksmithing tools, your smile would be rusty a few days after a filling and you would need to get used to the taste of iron. Even at much higher expense, gold is used in dentistry because of its superior performance and aesthetic appeal. Gold alloys are used for fillings, crowns, bridges and orthodontic appliances. Gold is used in dentistry because it is chemically inert, nonallergenic and easy for the dentist to work.\nGold is known to have been used in dentistry as early as 700 B.C. Etruscan \"dentists\" used gold wire to fasten replacement teeth into the mouths of their patients. Gold was probably used to fill cavities in ancient times, however there is no documentation or archaeological evidence for this use of gold until a little over 1000 years ago.\nGold was much more generously used in dentistry up until the late 1970's. The sharp run-up of gold prices at that time motivated the development of substitute materials. However, the amount of gold used in dentistry is starting to rise again. Some motivation for this comes from concerns that less inert metals might have an adverse effect on long-term health.\nMedical Uses of Gold\nGold is used as a drug to treat a small number of medical conditions. Injections of weak solutions of sodium aurothiomalate or aurothioglucose are sometimes used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Particles of a radioactive gold isotope are implanted in tissues to serve as a radiation source in the treatment of certain cancers.\nSmall amounts of gold are used to remedy a condition known as Lagophthalmos, which is an inability of a person to close their eyes completely. This condition is treated by implanting small amounts of gold in the upper eyelid. The implanted gold \"weights\" the eyelid and the force of gravity helps the eyelid close fully.\nRadioactive gold is used in diagnosis. It is injected in a colloidal solution that can be tracked as a beta emitter as it passes through the body. Many surgical instruments, electronic equipment and life-support devices are made using small amounts of gold. Gold is nonreactive in the instruments and is highly reliable in the electronic equipment and life-support devices.\nUses of Gold in Aerospace\nIf you are going to spend billions of dollars on a vehicle that when launched will travel on a voyage where the possibility of lubrication, maintenance and repair is absolutely zero, then building it with extremely dependable materials is essential. This is exactly why gold is used in hundreds of ways in every space vehicle that NASA launches.\nGold is used in circuitry because it is a dependable conductor and connector. In addition, many parts of every space vehicle are fitted with gold-coated polyester film. This film reflects infrared radiation and helps stabilize the temperature of the spacecraft. Without this coating, dark colored parts of the spacecraft would absorb significant amounts of heat\nGold is also used as a lubricant between mechanical parts. In the vacuum of space, organic lubricants would volatilize and they would be broken down by the intense radiation beyond Earth's atmosphere. Gold has a very low shear strength and thin films of gold between critical moving parts serves as a lubricant - the gold molecules slip past one another under the forces of friction and that provides a lubricant action.\nUses of Gold Awards &amp; Status Symbols\nWhat metal is used to make the crown worn by a king? Gold! This metal is selected for use because gold it is THE metal of highest esteem. It would make no sense to make a king's crown out of steel - even though steel is the strongest metal. Gold is chosen for use in a king's crown because it is the metal associated with highest esteem and status.\nGold is associated with many positive qualities. Purity is another quality associated with gold. For this reason, gold is the metal of choice for religious objects. Crosses, communion ware and other religious symbols are almost always made with gold for this reason.\nGold is also used as the first place winner's medal or trophy in almost any type of contest. First place winners at the Olympic Games are given gold medals. The Academy Awards Oscars are gold awards. Music's Grammy Awards are made of gold. All of these important achievements are honored with awards made of gold.\nUses of Gold in Glassmaking\nGold has many uses in the production of glass. The most basic use in glassmaking is that of a pigment. A small amount of gold suspended in the glass when it is annealed produces a rich ruby color.\nGold is also used when making specialty glass for climate controlled buildings and cases. A small amount of gold dispersed within the glass or coated onto the glass surface will reflect solar radiation outward, helping the buildings stay cool in the summer, and reflect internal heat inward, helping them stay warm in winter.\nThe visor on the helmet of an astronaut's space suit is coated with a very thin film of gold. This thin film reflects much of the very intense solar radiation of space, protecting the astronaut's eyes and skin.\nGold Gilding and Gold Leaf\nGold has the highest malleability of any metal. This enables gold to be beaten into sheets that are only a few millionths of an inch thick. These thin sheets, known as \"gold leaf\" can be applied over the irregular surfaces of picture frames, molding or furniture.\nGold leaf is also used on the external and internal surfaces of buildings. This provides a durable and corrosion-resistant covering. One of the most eye-catching uses of gold leaf is on the domes of religious buildings and other important structures. The cost of this \"roofing material\" is very high per square foot; however, the cost of the gold is only a few percent of the total project cost. Most of the cost goes to the labor of highly skilled artisans who apply the gold leaf.\nFuture Uses of Gold\nGold is too expensive to use by chance. Instead it is used deliberately and only when less expensive substitutes can not be identified. As a result, once a use is found for gold it is rarely abandoned for another metal. This means that the number of uses for gold have been increasing over time.\nMost of the ways that gold is used today have been developed only during the last two or three decades. This trend will likely continue. As our society requires more sophisticated and reliable materials our uses for gold will increase. This combination of growing demand, few substitutes and limited supply will cause the value and importance of gold to increase steadily over time. It is truly a metal of the future.\nTL;DR\nGold is used in many different fields, in addition to the fact it's hard to get (mining etc.) there are many industrial uses.\nThus my stance remains, BTC may &gt; GOLD in the future, but it wont crash it\n", "author": "Aki4real Sr. Member Offline Activity: 336 Merit: 250 Let's change the world "}, {"date": "2015-07-31 20:21:23", "content": "No.\nPeople needs to physically hold their valuable things.

Raised level of complexity will reduce system's robustness and integrity\nSuppose that 1000 bitcoins were send to side chain US, and then 1000 USbtc will born. We are talking about a future that each bitcoin worth one million dollars, so USbtc blockchain will have 1 billion dollars worth of coins, enough for a small ecosystem\nThen there are several issues:\n1. The chain US must be enough secure: You either use other hashing solution to secure the network (and dilute the hash power for bitcoin network at mean time) or merge mine together with bitcoin (risk of double spending attack by other bitcoin hash power)\n2. In order to use those USbtc, merchant have to install another client to specifically work with it. There will be other side chains like EUbtc, AUbtc, CNbtc etc...  And since EUbtc is not spendable on USbtc network, vice versa, each merchant/exchange will install and maintain a whole bunch of different clients if they want to do business with its international customers. So unless all the side chains are invisible to end users through a single unique interface, the most likely outcome is that each country use its own side chain due to speed advantage in its domestic network\n3. If CNbtc grows a lot and there is a strong demand for CNbtc in china, this will cause its exchange rate to be higher than bitcoins on the main chain. Then there is a motivation to convert main chain bitcoins to CNbtc due to 1:1 peg. There will be arbitraging happening every second on the blockchain to profit from the different exchange rates between different chains, thus the whole bitcoin main chain becomes an exchange platform, dramatically increase its traffic\n4. The mainchain is not aware nor responsible for what is happening on the side chain, so if something went wrong on side chain, it might cause the mainchain to fork due to nodes might disagree with the different truth they receive from the same side chain...\nIn one word, raised level of complexity will bring much more problems that you can never expect\n", "author": "johnyj Legendary Offline Activity: 1848 Merit: 1000 Beyond Imagination "}, {"date": "2015-09-12 02:36:49", "content": "could some side chain serve as payment network that could be settled end of day by being included by miners on the main chain as some kind of super block?\n", "author": "jonald_fyookball Legendary Offline Activity: 1302 Merit: 1002 Core dev leaves me neg feedback #abuse #political "}, {"date": "2015-09-12 03:00:47", "content": "could some side chain serve as payment network that could be settled end of day by being included by miners on the main chain as some kind of super block?\nyou should be able to transfer in and out of a side chain at any time at a fixed ratio. i guess what you're suggesting is that once a day everyone on that chain would be automatically dumped back into BTC?\n", "author": "adamstgBit Legendary Offline Activity: 1904 Merit: 1002 Trusted Bitcoiner "}, {"date": "2015-09-12 03:02:22", "content": "could some side chain serve as payment network that could be settled end of day by being included by miners on the main chain as some kind of super block?\nyou should be able to transfer in and out of a side chain at any time at a fixed ratio. i guess what you're suggesting is that once a day everyone on that chain would be automatically dumped back into BTC?\nprecisely.\nThe sidechain would have less security than the mainchain, because it would be different set of miners/nodes, but the risk would be contained.\n", "author": "jonald_fyookball Legendary Offline Activity: 1302 Merit: 1002 Core dev leaves me neg feedback #abuse #political "}, {"date": "2015-09-12 04:10:54", "content": "On the contrary.  The sidechains would\nMy concern with sidechains isn't about their mathematically sound implementation, but rather with their effect on the incentives structure that has proven to work so well for the original Bitcoin.\nIf sidechains gain enough traction, they will form new clusters of gravity, which will begin tearing the idea of a single ledger apart fairly quickly with no one being interested in securing the main chain, which in turn would only accelerate the drainage of its value.\nIf that manifests, the niche that Bitcoin was created to fill will simply be left up for grabs and the competition will surely take the chance.\nI was about to argue against this, but now I think I see how this could happen.  To simplify, CoinX is a sidechain that gains a lot of momentum, so much so, that 90% of bitcoins become \"locked\" into it.

Even improvements they might make won't make it back to bitcoin because MIT license allows taking the code and closing it.\nIn comparison, Linux is GPL licensed (which requires all derivatives to be GPL and thus open too), so many companies are collectively contributing to its code as they make improvements for their own good.
