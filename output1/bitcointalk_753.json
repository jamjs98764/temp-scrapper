Well no shit, that's why you buy $20 worth, BUT that's an example of the gap. Average joe shmoe jon doe doesn't know that he can buy 0.01. It's these very tiny short comings that leave everyone confused thinking it's a scam.  When i visit my hometown buddies they always say \"Bitcoin crashed hey\" (Keep in mind I am basing this off very educated people). People just aren't finding legitimate information, the news isn't interested if it's not negative, and the financial companies with the advertising power want it gone.. blahblahblah When all you hear is about a scam, and frauds, and crashes, i don't think the average joe becomes interested in doing his/her own research.  Slowly but surely.\n", "author": "sobitcoin Full Member Offline Activity: 210 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-12-11 22:14:43", "content": "The bank manager who wouldn't let me open an account for a Bitcoin-related, state and federally compliant business does.
