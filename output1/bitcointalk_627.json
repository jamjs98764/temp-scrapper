It becomes one more address which the wallet can use and its private key is permanently stored there.\nSweeping the key means creating a TX that spends everything from your 'paper' address into any address already present on your wallet.\nSweeping is preferred basically for 2 reasons:\n- Your 'paper' address' private key was already stored somewhere and you typed it. As a result there's a small chance it was compromised in the process (key logger, malware). Therefore you shouldn't use it again and sweeping allows you that.\n- Most wallets are now\nHD\nso a single backup holds every address, even those not used yet. If you import the address it wouldn't be on the HD backup and you could eventually lose it.\n", "author": "EcuaMobi Legendary Offline Activity: 1554 Merit: 1180 https://Ecua.Mobi "}, {"date": "2015-11-24 01:47:47", "content": "Ok, and should I use blockchain.info, or something for mobile?\n", "author": "BitNerd Full Member Offline Activity: 131 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-11-24 02:17:39", "content": "Also don't forget about \"change addresses\".

I understand that we need the banks and governments to get onboard and more importantly we need their investments to get the thousands of new solutions out to the masses, therefore I welcome the banks and the governments to invest in Fintech and Bitcoin as this is awesome for Bitcoin the Blockchain and the whole decentralized payment space. Lucky banks and governments are full of morons who are ready to throw money left and right just to stay relevant but I believe they have no idea what so ever regarding the future of money and banking and will be left behind as soon as they stop paying the bills. However currently the arrival of banks and governments as investors in this decentralized payment space has changed the Bitcoin community a lot as developers now are trying to distance themselves from the anarchists and radicals to appear more proper and in tone with the centralized program of control. And this results in more and more censorship within the Bitcoin communities when it comes to anarchistic ideas or radical thought. But people please understand Bitcoin and the blockchain is very radical technology and thus will attract radical people. Who for the most part are honest dreamers of freedom and prosperity for all men and woman. Society should really thanks the anarchist and radicals more as this group of people are always the ones brave enough to get onboard new technology. I believe if it was not for this group of people we would not have a world full of great technology as we do !

If you have not contributed actual code to a bitcoin-implementation, this is probably not the place you want to reach out to. There are many places to discuss things that the developers read, including this forum.\nlink to this week logs\nMeeting minutes by meetbot\nMain topics discussed where:\ntransaction priority\ndealing with mempool eviction\nSequence numbers\nShort topics/notes\nOpt-in replace by fee\nneeds some extra testing, but otherwise seems ready to go. Some wallet developers are on board and actively participating, for example GreenAddress.\ntransaction priority\n- background\nEach transaction is assigned a priority, determined by the age, size, and number of inputs. Which currently makes some transactions free.\nThis currently has a large amount of code, which makes it harder to maintain, and is not that optimal since you can't expect miners to include 0-fee transactions.\n- meeting comments\nIf we don't stop support for priority in transaction creation we also need a mempool area for priority, or those transactions will always get evicted.\nIf we develop a better framework to support these kind of metrics we can add it back.\nPlan is to remove the priority transaction creation from the wallet, not the mining part.\n- meeting conclusion\nCreation of priority transactions should be removed from the wallet.\ndealing with mempool eviction\n- background\nWhen a transaction is relayed across the network it is held by the nodes in memory, until it gets into a block. All these transactions that sit in memory are called the memorypool or mempool for short.\nLike we could see during the spam-attack if there's a big back-log of transactions that couldn't make it in the blockchain this mempool can get pretty big resulting in nodes crashing.\nTo stop this from happening devs created a mechanism to reject and/or remove transactions from the mempool.\n- meeting comments\nCurrent problem: when a wallet transaction is rejected by the mempool, the wallet considers the resulting transaction as \"conflicting\" and will happily respend the inputs.\nsipa proposes to make the wallet only treat a transaction as conflicting if it has non-existing inputs.\nIt should however consider it respendable at some time later on.\nYou could add a way to manually remove transactions, or tag is as removed, or archive it.\nYou could also do something separate that marks the transaction as respendable, as removal gives the impression the transaction can't be mined in the future.\nOptions that are wanted: a \"respend with higher fee\" option and an option to forget about a transaction completely, we need a minimum viable idea for 0.12 though.\n- meeting conclusion\nGiven the tight deadline for 0.12 we detect actual conflict instead of mempool eviction and leave the coins immediately respendable.\nSequence numbers\n- background\nBIP 68\nrepurposes some of the unused nSequence field to a relative locktime, meaning locking inputs until a certain time or blockheight has passed.\n- meeting comments\nWe need to wait for BIP113 to be deployed as standardness so\nBIP 68\n,\n112\nand\n113\ncan go in a softfork.\nThere's upcoming projects that already use sequence numbers.\nMerging BIP68 would make BIP112 easier to review and would stop the need to\nrebase\nall the time.\nIf we feel the 68/112 are sufficiently reviewed and mature they could go in as standardness rules.\nThe BIP text doesn't seem to reflect what's written in the code.\n-

It becomes one more address which the wallet can use and its private key is permanently stored there.\nSweeping the key means creating a TX that spends everything from your 'paper' address into any address already present on your wallet.\nSweeping is preferred basically for 2 reasons:\n- Your 'paper' address' private key was already stored somewhere and you typed it. As a result there's a small chance it was compromised in the process (key logger, malware). Therefore you shouldn't use it again and sweeping allows you that.\n- Most wallets are now\nHD\nso a single backup holds every address, even those not used yet. If you import the address it wouldn't be on the HD backup and you could eventually lose it.\n", "author": "EcuaMobi Legendary Offline Activity: 1554 Merit: 1180 https://Ecua.Mobi "}, {"date": "2015-11-24 01:47:47", "content": "Ok, and should I use blockchain.info, or something for mobile?\n", "author": "BitNerd Full Member Offline Activity: 131 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-11-24 02:17:39", "content": "Also don't forget about \"change addresses\".

I understand that we need the banks and governments to get onboard and more importantly we need their investments to get the thousands of new solutions out to the masses, therefore I welcome the banks and the governments to invest in Fintech and Bitcoin as this is awesome for Bitcoin the Blockchain and the whole decentralized payment space. Lucky banks and governments are full of morons who are ready to throw money left and right just to stay relevant but I believe they have no idea what so ever regarding the future of money and banking and will be left behind as soon as they stop paying the bills. However currently the arrival of banks and governments as investors in this decentralized payment space has changed the Bitcoin community a lot as developers now are trying to distance themselves from the anarchists and radicals to appear more proper and in tone with the centralized program of control. And this results in more and more censorship within the Bitcoin communities when it comes to anarchistic ideas or radical thought. But people please understand Bitcoin and the blockchain is very radical technology and thus will attract radical people. Who for the most part are honest dreamers of freedom and prosperity for all men and woman. Society should really thanks the anarchist and radicals more as this group of people are always the ones brave enough to get onboard new technology. I believe if it was not for this group of people we would not have a world full of great technology as we do ! So thank you all brave anarchist and radical thinkers who are brave enough to get onboard new technology and have used their own time and money to push new ideas  forward even though society is against it in the beginning.. thank you.. thank you.. thank you.\nAnd f.ck all the developers who forget who their real supports are.. we are all human and have a right to use technology !\nDevelopers should try only to make solutions for humans without getting involved in politics, right and wrong and all that sh.t\nPower to the people !

Multiply that by 3 and you get the current dust threshold of 0.0000273 BTC.\nThis means that in order to spend 0.0000273 BTC or lower, you will be paying one third or more of that amount in fees.\nSo if I get it right:\nIn a transaction with 1 input and 1 output the required fee will be 910 Satoshi.\nAnd if it have 2 inputs and 1 output, it will be 1650 Satoshi.\nBut what will happen in both cases if the inputs are below the transaction dust threshold, how big should be the fee in order to ensure that the transaction will be relayed?\nNo, the transaction has a bunch of other data that also increases its size. The size that we are talking about here are specifically the bytes for an output and its corresponding input in the next transaction. It does not matter what the inputs of a transaction are, just that the size in bytes of the output and the corresponding input that spends it. In most cases this will be 182 bytes.\nIt does not matter that the inputs are dust, just that the outputs are dust. If the inputs are dust, then you will probably be spending more on fees than you will be getting in outputs.\n", "author": "Pattart Hero Member Offline Activity: 952 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-11-24 11:51:14", "content": "Alright.

If you have not contributed actual code to a bitcoin-implementation, this is probably not the place you want to reach out to. There are many places to discuss things that the developers read, including this forum.\nlink to this week logs\nMeeting minutes by meetbot\nMain topics discussed where:\ntransaction priority\ndealing with mempool eviction\nSequence numbers\nShort topics/notes\nOpt-in replace by fee\nneeds some extra testing, but otherwise seems ready to go. Some wallet developers are on board and actively participating, for example GreenAddress.\ntransaction priority\n- background\nEach transaction is assigned a priority, determined by the age, size, and number of inputs. Which currently makes some transactions free.\nThis currently has a large amount of code, which makes it harder to maintain, and is not that optimal since you can't expect miners to include 0-fee transactions.\n- meeting comments\nIf we don't stop support for priority in transaction creation we also need a mempool area for priority, or those transactions will always get evicted.\nIf we develop a better framework to support these kind of metrics we can add it back.\nPlan is to remove the priority transaction creation from the wallet, not the mining part.\n- meeting conclusion\nCreation of priority transactions should be removed from the wallet.\ndealing with mempool eviction\n- background\nWhen a transaction is relayed across the network it is held by the nodes in memory, until it gets into a block. All these transactions that sit in memory are called the memorypool or mempool for short.\nLike we could see during the spam-attack if there's a big back-log of transactions that couldn't make it in the blockchain this mempool can get pretty big resulting in nodes crashing.\nTo stop this from happening devs created a mechanism to reject and/or remove transactions from the mempool.\n- meeting comments\nCurrent problem: when a wallet transaction is rejected by the mempool, the wallet considers the resulting transaction as \"conflicting\" and will happily respend the inputs.\nsipa proposes to make the wallet only treat a transaction as conflicting if it has non-existing inputs.\nIt should however consider it respendable at some time later on.\nYou could add a way to manually remove transactions, or tag is as removed, or archive it.\nYou could also do something separate that marks the transaction as respendable, as removal gives the impression the transaction can't be mined in the future.\nOptions that are wanted: a \"respend with higher fee\" option and an option to forget about a transaction completely, we need a minimum viable idea for 0.12 though.\n- meeting conclusion\nGiven the tight deadline for 0.12 we detect actual conflict instead of mempool eviction and leave the coins immediately respendable.\nSequence numbers\n- background\nBIP 68\nrepurposes some of the unused nSequence field to a relative locktime, meaning locking inputs until a certain time or blockheight has passed.\n- meeting comments\nWe need to wait for BIP113 to be deployed as standardness so\nBIP 68\n,\n112\nand\n113\ncan go in a softfork.\nThere's upcoming projects that already use sequence numbers.\nMerging BIP68 would make BIP112 easier to review and would stop the need to\nrebase\nall the time.\nIf we feel the 68/112 are sufficiently reviewed and mature they could go in as standardness rules.\nThe BIP text doesn't seem to reflect what's written in the code.\n- meeting conclusion\nCheck BIP68 to match the\nimplementation\nParticipants\nCode:\nsipa               Pieter Wuille\ngmaxwell           Gregory Maxwell\nmorcos             Alex Morcos\njtimon             Jorge Timón\nwumpus             Wladimir J. van der Laan\nbtcdrak            btcdrak\njgarzik            Jeff Garzik\npetertodd          Peter Todd\nLuke-Jr            Luke Dashjr\nBlueMatt           Matt Corallo\njonasschnelli      Jonas Schnelli\nCodeShark          Eric Lombrozo\nsdaftuar           Suhas Daftuar\ngavinand1esen      Gavin Andresen\n", "views": 308, "author": "G1lius Newbie Offline Activity: 13 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin dev IRC meeting in layman's terms (2015-11-19)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-11-23 17:10:12"}]}
