Bitcoin offers pseudo anonymity and more security from confiscation. Using a checking account for small amounts isn't too big a risk but the bank knows your business. Keeping a large sum there makes it possible to lose it via a \"bail in\" if you believe our economic system is close to collapse (many solid economics thinks so). With banks paying near zero interest then commodities like gold and silver are more secure and the loss of interest on them is not a big deal. But you can't send silver or gold through the Internet. Now Bitcoin compared to credit cards seems like a no-brainer. Bitcoin doesn't send your identity. No one can make fraudulent charges after they steal your Bitcoin number. Yes, I'm aware that you can call the bank and BEG them to take the charges off, threaten them that you will stop using their services if they don't and whatever else but because you pander to 'the credit rating\" they have you by the shorthairs. The merchants have everything to gain and nothing to lose by using Bitcoin. Will credit card fraud increase or decrease? Identity theft? They all weigh in.\n", "author": "Bungeebones Full Member Offline Activity: 180 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 22:18:22", "content": "What happened to all the so called technological wizards who work in the banking industry?

How long did it take the transaction to confirm? How many parties were involved in confirming the transaction? Did I need to be connected to the Internet to do it?\nChecks can clear absolutely instantly at banks. There is no need for blocks to be solved, confirmations from third parties or anything else. The reason they take some time to clear is not because of some wizard level problem. It is because a check is a piece of paper someone wrote some amount on.\nThe check writer may not have the money or the check may be forged, that's why it takes a while to clear. Why do people use checks? Because they are really easy to use, if you have a guy working on your plumbing, you can write him a check when he is done. The plumber doesn't need any kind of computer to accept the check and can just put it in his pocket. No merchant processors, no need to connect to the Internet, no bitcoin addresses, no confirmations.\nWith a U.S. bank, you have a whole host of options when you want to pay someone:\n- paper check\n- paper cashiers check from the bank account (funds are guaranteed)\n- electronic transfer (including via email address or mobile phone number)\n- recurring automatic electronic transfers\n- wire transfer\n- debit card (most have the money in the account, receiver needs merchant account)\n- credit card (borrowed money, receiver needs merchant account)\nThose are the most common.

How long did it take the transaction to confirm? How many parties were involved in confirming the transaction? Did I need to be connected to the Internet to do it?\nChecks can clear absolutely instantly at banks. There is no need for blocks to be solved, confirmations from third parties or anything else. The reason they take some time to clear is not because of some wizard level problem. It is because a check is a piece of paper someone wrote some amount on.\nThe check writer may not have the money or the check may be forged, that's why it takes a while to clear. Why do people use checks? Because they are really easy to use, if you have a guy working on your plumbing, you can write him a check when he is done. The plumber doesn't need any kind of computer to accept the check and can just put it in his pocket. No merchant processors, no need to connect to the Internet, no bitcoin addresses, no confirmations.\nWith a U.S. bank, you have a whole host of options when you want to pay someone:\n- paper check\n- paper cashiers check from the bank account (funds are guaranteed)\n- electronic transfer (including via email address or mobile phone number)\n- recurring automatic electronic transfers\n- wire transfer\n- debit card (most have the money in the account, receiver needs merchant account)\n- credit card (borrowed money, receiver needs merchant account)\nThose are the most common. Banks have zero use for crypto currency, things work great as it is.\nBanking is not free. Your costs are being subsidised by other people's charges.\nAs stated above, I cashed a cheque last week.

Which would have been better both for you &amp; Granny -- she's just enabling you, should let you hit rock-bottom.\nThe great thing about Bitcoin is that it allows those who are bankless to participate in the global economy....And, it provides a platform by which one can interact within the digital economy on a micro-scale which benefits consumers of intellectual content, as well as, the artists who produce it.\nWho are these works of fiction? Why can't they buy prepaid cards, at their local bodegas, but can buy bitcoins?\n'S far as microtransactions go, forget about those. Because \"[Bitcoin transactions currently cost] $373 * 25BTC / 2.7tps * (600sec per block) =\n~$5.75 + tx fee, per fucking transaction.\nYou don't pay it because it's currently subsidized by Bitcoin base money inflation, i.e. printing 25 bitcoins out of thin air every 10 minutes.\"\nThere are some places in the world that do not have \"local bodegas\" and there are others that are in extreme turmoil due conflict and unrest....In fact, I used to think like you until I found out that not every city in the world has a 7-Eleven on all their corners.  I don't know, it's just nice that those who are struggling in third world nations have an outlet to participate in commerce when they need it.  Countries whose economy is suffering with hyper-inflation, at least, have the option to store their assets in bitcoin to secure their holdings...Zimbabwe for example.\nThose places without local bodegas, in social turmoil, full of unbanked -- their commerce is Bitcoin-based, you say? Or do they order shit on the internet, via universal free sat uplinks?\nDo you know that\n\"Nearly half the world's population, 2.8 billion people, survive on less than $2 a day\"\n? These are the people who are going to flock to Bitcoin? To buy angora socks on AlphaBay, I take it?\nWhere do you get these weird fantasies?\nP.S. Inflation is a *rich people problem*.  When you're living on &lt; $2 a day, ain't much money sitting in the bank. 4realsies.\nNo, they're the shoeless one's raising the rabbits, processing the fur, and producing the angora socks to sell to the bourgeoisie so that they can earn enough to feed their children.\nThese are figments of your imagination, like pink elephants and the bugs crawling under your skin after you do too much shitty DNM crank -- not real, they do not exist.\nStop concocting these outlandish fantasies -- you won't reconcile your trying to get rich by buying\nBTC\neanies &amp; sitting on your butt with basic human ethics, sorry.\nPut me in touch with *one* person like that, *ONE*. Then we'll talk.\nP.S. No need to thank me for letting you advertise that dice site in your sig.\nHere are some real world cases:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTVWasymExg\nP.S.  More than dice....Poker's my thing....But, thank you anyway....Capitalism at it's best!\nLol, this is exactly what I mean: you're being fed bullshit. Already addressed her:\n...\nNo one is giving out any (meaningful sums of) Bitcoins in Africa. The last thing I heard was some BitPesa\n3dpd\nlady taking Safaricom to Kenyan High Court because \"BAWW, payment processors don't want to play with us.\"\n...and LOSING!!\nEveryone wants to *make money* on 3rd-world countries. These are not nice people. Bitcoiners are banksters too, only worse.

It is highly possible that such situation given at the main post cam be verified. Normally every new thing is an improvement of something old. Even bitcoin was and is a qualitative technological improvement. So remain to think and to decide what to do with our bitcoins. I have chosen time ago what to do. Diversification of my amount of bitcoins in other cryptos and the hold only of some of those.

They would never consider telling a lie of such magnitude themselves, or knowing that it would require such impudence, they would not consider it possible for it to be told by others.

instance VC's hand miners FIAT to pay the electric. and the miners hand bitcoins to the VC as their returns. that way funds dont actually touch public exchanges..\neven things like bitpay received 30+million in fiat a couple years ago and they used the fiat to pay customers and gave the bitcoin to VC's, without needing to touch exchanges as often as you would think.\nsecondly. if miners are losing funds due to VC's not accepting their transactions (due to threat of orphaning.. then miners would downgrade to mitigate the risk of orphans or go offline temporarily to conserve costs..

orphans\n2. they had enough hash power to tip the scales in their favour without loss\n3. they had community relaying support to ensure their blocks got relayed.\n4. their not mentally retarded to risk more processing time, orphans or going offline which would be 3 slaps in the face, for just being to eager.\ninstead they would wait it out until the time was right. even if gavins 'few week' predicted timescale elapses, miners just wont move forward until they are sure.\nthis is also the reason miners dont upgrade their mining software as often. as they like to let the community test out new software before risking using it on a pool.\nif you think that accepting more transactions(fees) is more important compared to long term regular income.. you are wrong.\ncurrently fee's average 0.4btc total per block. if you think they are going to let in another 100 transactions (1.05mb instead of 0.99mb) just to get 0.42btc while risking their opportunities for multiple long term earnings of 12.5btc.. well im guessing you prefer the conspiracy theory more than logic theory.\nsome miners may be mentally impaired and try pushing beyond the 1mb limit prematurely, but they will find their attempts cost them if they dont have all the other factors ready to protect them and the community, and so the are just shooting themselves in the foot and only hurting themselves in the end. and so eventually they will adjust down to start earning again and wait for a better time to adjust up again, or the rest of the community will grow to allow miners to move forward sooner.. or the miner will

Some really great information here, what a great thread. Can I give a newbie summary as I see it, and please correct me where I am wrong.\nThere are two main camps.\nSegWit who want to extend the functionality of Bitcoin, and as part of this extension, they want to split the transaction for storage in two chains (is this correct?) The important section regarding the amount of the transfer and the history link stay in the existing blockchain, but because of the reduction in information, more transactions can be stored in a block. This solves the size problem in the short term, and still allows for an upgrade to 2Mb blocks when traffic volumes have increased in the future. This could become effective fairly quickly.\nDouble blocks want to double the size of the blocks as a temporary solution, and then increase them again in the future as traffic continues to increase, They believe that this can be implemented immediately. Whilst the code changes could be incorporated quickly, it seems to me that no miner would produce blocks over 1Mb in case the SegWit fork wins, and they lose their income. Thus the 2Mb change will not be effective until the fork dispute is resolved.\nIf core includes some of the other enhancements with SegWit, then wouldn't that become the popular choice of nodes?

But I'll stick to a claim that some prominent Core dev stated that analysis of recent blocks led to this figure.\nOthers I have seen use a 4x figure - totally dependent upon an assumption that multisig become a much larger portion of the transaction volume.\nFor this little branch of the discussion, the salient point is that any node that performs validation (i.e. any node operating in a trustless manner) must process not the claimed 1MB block size worth of data, but an amount of data that reflects the signature data as well - 1MB multiplied by this (instantaneous) scaling factor, be it 1.75x, 4x, or whatever else represents the proportion of signature data associated with the transactions included in that block.\n", "author": "jbreher Legendary Offline Activity: 2142 Merit: 1089 lose: unfind ... loose: untight "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 19:44:59", "content": "If you are really interested in why 75% is not enough, the definitive answer is found here:\nhttp://organofcorti.blogspot.com/2015/08/bip101-implementation-flaws.html\nBecause the stated 75% criteria produces a negligible yet discernible chance that we get a false trigger at an actual 67% adoption rate due to variance?

OrganOfCorti's post seems to focus upon mathematics, yours seems to focus upon hysteria. Shall we analyze this together?\nThe damning part of the analysis is specific to BIP 101, and assumes 'vote spoofing' upon the part of nefarious actors. Such is fine, and important in regards to analyzing the BIP 101 situation. However, you present it as if it is  universally-applicable to any 75% proposal. 'Flaw #3' is inapplicable to any situation where the tabulation of 75% is strictly based upon hash power.\nSo yes, it seems to me that you are trolling.\nEven so, there is an admitted latent issue with the order of magnitude in the comments, unaddressed for months.\nAnonymous31 August 2015 at 03:46\n&gt; The number of failure attempts before a success occurs in trials of this type is called a geometrically distributed random variable, and can be used to find the probability of some arbitrary true proportion resulting in more than 749 blocks of a sequential 1,000, after that true proportion has been present for some number of blocks.\nThis is incorrect, as overlapping sequences are extremely correlated. Treating overlapping sequences as independent trials will massively overestimate the chances of success. The expected time for a 0.7 proportion of hashrate to result in a 0.75 proportion of blocks is closer to 300,000.\nhttp://bitco.in/forum/threads/triggering-the-bip101-fork-early-with-less-than-75-miners.13/\nReply\nOrgan Ofcorti31 August 2015 at 16:18\nYes and I feel a bit silly about missing that! I realised it after a redditor commented:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ilwq1/bip101_implementation_flaws/cuhy71q\nI'll be posting an update after I get the weekly stats out. I haven't had time to figure out an analytical approach, but I'll generate some nice plots based on simulations.\nOr more importantly, the amount of time for variance to result in a false trigger is important. The other analysis in the quoted comment above puts the chance as \"\nTL;DR: At anything less than 70% of steady hashrate, triggering a fork would take at least 6 years, and gets exponentially less likely as miner share decreases.\n\"\nEven the bulk of Core devs are seeming to claim that it will be necessary in the not-too-distant future to increase the block size. Just not now. For some unstated reason. If variance results in a trigger after Core would have already increased the block size anyhow, then the trigger is a non-event. No chain fork results.

here goes\nA.\nthis scenario is where just one miner with the most hash power compared to any other\nsingle\nminer.\nalthough it appear the miner has 27% of hash power, effectively because it is adding more transactions the processing time is longer so the 'feel' of the hashing speed is more like 24%, thus its not going to be racing ahead making longer chains and only has 1 turn on average every 4 blocks to win.\nthus with 90% consensus against it.. that 1 block out of 4 would get orphaned because the other 90% would ignore it and the next block they add wont have the over1mb block in its chain.\nso there are 2 defenses, not enough hashpower to race ahead with over 1mb blockheights, and not enough peer consensus (nodes running same implementation).\nB.\nthis is where there is a hashrate power of over 75%. but even in this case there is only 40% peer consensus, and so with all 10 miners connecting together to show each other a solved block. 6 out of 10 would orphan off that over1mb block. a bit more complicated to explain, but basically the end result is that eventually there is still just 1 chain of the under 1mb blocks, once the miners communicate and sort out the orphans.\nC.\nthis is where there is 75% of peer consensus where the hashrate is over 90%. in this case the majority wins on both counts and the minority (under1mb) gets left behind with a chain that does not sync up.\nremember. 2mb rule allows both under 1mb blocks and over1mb blocks.. so even if a 2mb consensus has not been reached the 2mb implementations would still happily accept the valid under1mb rules.. there would not be any hard forks as orphaning will rejoin any disputing blocks.\nhowever old 1mb implementations, if they lose dominance in both counts. will end up with:\n1. having a chain that doesnt sync up because it rejects the majority of blocks\n2. the amount of peer nodes with an altnative chain would be limited.\n3. miners who continue to mine in the minority wont be able to spend the efforts as its rejected.\n4. would have to upgrade to regain sync ability and earning potential.\nbut as i say. this is only a concern for those that dont upgrade to a 2mb implementation. and only then if scenario C came into play.\nso there is no issue in users having a 2mb implementation, where the setting just sits there as a buffer, doing nothing until scenario C comes about.\nwhat is more disasterous. is that bitcoin-core refuses to code a 2mb implementation which means if a scenario C came about.. the entire community would be left behind with unsync-able nodes.\nso just as a line of safety for the possibility of something happening in the next 3 years, its far better to allow users to have the setting there, just as a buffer.. than to refuse to give people the buffer and scream that the disaster is someone elses fault.\nas i said having the setting for users, is not a call to arms. its not a red nuclear button. its just a setting that sits there as a buffer.. just like the 1mb limit was just a buffer while miners were making only 0-500k blocks in 2009-2013.\nminers logic and psychology shows and proves that they wont risk adding more transactions (increasing processing time) if they think there blocks will get orphaned. and so they are not going to jump the gun. its not in their financial interest to do so unless the community is ready to accept their blocks, so they can atleast spend their rewards.\nand anyone trying to imply nefarious intent of some miners.. ill refer you to scenario A, and possibly B(if collusion and naferious intent are combined). but in general long term reward earnings outweight possibility of short term nefarious intent. so relax\nnow onto bitcoin-core\nwe all know, bitcoin-core is a full node client. anyone interested in being a full node in april will need to upgrade to remain full node status, due to segwit. otherwise they are automatically causing their non-upgraded clients to become \"compatible\" nodes. not full validation nodes.\nso knowing full nodes will be upgrading just to stay full node status. i think the April update should also include the 2mb setting buffer. that way even 3 years later or 6 months.. whenever the miners feel comfortable to be scenario C.. it wont impact the community because the community is already prepared.\nremember the 2mb rule is not a rule that says \"you have to accept blocks over 1mb\". its not a nuclear launchcode of bloat.\nits a buffer setting of \"anything from 0b to 2mb\" which includes normal blocks as they stand today.\nagain just like the 1mb was a buffer while miners were happy below 500k a few years back\nso while miners stick safely to their 1mb rule the community can happily be prepared for 2mb possibilities of the future.\nif bitcoin-core refuses to prepare the community before miners act.. then it would be bitcoin-cores fault for users not being able to sync once consensus has been reached.\nill just leave

Tyra explains Bitcoin's potential effects to the accounting profession. In the article he writes\n\"Double entry bookkeeping revolutionized the field of financial accounting during the Renaissance period. Whereas simple ledgers had long been the standard for record keeping for merchants, the church and state treasuries, the growth of long distance trade and creation of the first joint stock companies resulted in firms whose records were too voluminous and complicated to provide any assurance of accuracy to their users.The double entry system solved the problem of managers knowing whether they could trust their own books.\"\nDouble entry accounting changed human history. It essentially enabled the employer-employee relationships to develop and, without them, companies such as Ford, IBM or Google would not be possible. The key benefit was that double entry accounting enabled bookkeeping practices to be used to help make sure the parties to the employment contracts were remaining honest.\n", "views": 245, "author": "Bungeebones Full Member Offline Activity: 180 Merit: 100 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow might Bitcoin impact employee/employer relations?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-02-02 20:27:32", "content": "its got a Gazillion innovations, the US Fed gov must be packing bricks\ni can see an massive Silicon Valley based shift n US politics\n", "author": "Bitcoinpro Legendary Offline Activity: 1218 Merit: 1000 "}], "date": "2016-02-02 20:18:58"}, {"content": "Hi many people like Peter Rs presentation about fee market. I disagree with him and wrote a blog post why.\nhttp://danielwilczynski.com/2015/11/30/why-peter-rs-fee-market-wont-work\nAt the first Scaling Bitcoin conference Peter R presented his ideas on why a fee market would exist without a block size limit. You can see his presentation here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad0Pjj_ms2k\n.\nHe is wrong and I will explain why.\nPeter says that a non-zero supply curve exists because increasing block size increases cost to miners due to higher orphan rate. I have also heard a variation of this argument with increasing block size being constrained by hardware resources, internet bandwidth etc.\nTheoretically these arguments are correct, practically they are not.\nThe effect of block size on these costs is almost negligible.\nThe supply curve is not exactly flat but very close to it. It is practically (if not theoretically)  flat and at zero. In reality a fee market will not form.\nAs an example, we have a supply and demand curve for oxygen but there is no real market for it because its impractical for something so cheap with such a flat and low curve. Yes, Oxygen does have a supply curve because humans are capable of increasing its supply at an increasing cost.\nWhen curves meet at extremes the market breaks down.\nNo block size limit would simply result in huge blocks and a much more centralised node network, that can be easier influenced by governments.\nBut lets ignore all of the above for a second.\nPeter also says we need at least 2 mining pools, for a market to form based on the orphan rate cost. Of course you hardly have much of a market with 2 pools, or 5-10 pools. That is what we have now. You can not have a real efficient market for orphan rates with only a few participants at one end.\nFurthermore, orphan rate is a result of block propagation and can be decreased by moving pools closer together geographically. That is obviously very negative if we are trying to prevent mining centralisation.\nYou might ask, why can a fee market form with fixed block-size supply then? After-all we still have only a small number of pools? The reason is, that in Peters model the cost variable is due to the differing orphan rate between pools. That is not true for fixed block size. There is no variable for the supply curve. Thats why the supply curve is a straight vertical line.\nFinally Peter refers to the block size limit as some artificial centrally controlled limit.\nHe does raise a good and important point here. In the situation of a fee-market based on limited block size. What would be the mechanism for changing the block-size limit and who would have control? The solutions from Peter R or others did not satisfy me personally. It is a valid question though. Are we to have a hard-fork each time we decide the fees are getting too high or low?  Do we implement code to allow a semi-centralised authority to decide? These do not seem like good solutions.\nTo say it is a centrally controlled limit is wrong however. To change the limit needs the consensus of the network i.e. nodes. Core developers have some limited ability to influence people, but ultimately they can not force through any change by themselves, they need the networks tacit agreement. Nobody and everybody controls the limit. Its control is decentralised (and therefore hard to change).\nFinally there is nothing exceptionally artificial about the limit. Bitcoin itself is artificial, the 21 million limit is also an arbitrary artificial limit. Humans set the parameters of Bitcoin, its supply and its block size limit. The problem and difference is the 21 million limit does not have to change. Block size limit might have to, how will that be decided?\n", "views": 5389, "author": "danielW Sr. Member Offline Activity: 277 Merit: 250 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy Peter Rs Fee Market Wont Work\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-01-23 01:41:36", "content": "I have read and thought about what you are saying and\nfirst of all, thank you for reading and peer reviewing\nPeter's paper.\nLet's discuss.\nI would like to believe that Peter is correct but\nI'm open minded enough to consider that he may not be.\nI want to understand more clearly what you are saying and why.\nPeter says that a non-zero supply curve exists because increasing block size increases cost to miners due to higher orphan rate.

The problem and difference is the 21 million limit does not have to change. Block size limit might have to, how will that be decided?\nYes, in fact his model indicated that in order to accept large blocks to earn more fee income, miners should use centralized large data center and relay network to speed up their communication and reduce the orphan cost. That's exactly the worst result from decentralization point of view, and his model does not calculate the value of decentralization, thus is too simplified\nIt is also interesting that you mentioned that all the limit in bitcoin is artificial. So if you could find a good reason why block size should be limited then that limit is possible to be accepted by the majority of the participants, similar to 21 million coin supply\nCurrently all the arguments that \"block should not be full\" borrow the typical reasoning from production and service industry: A higher cost for consumer will slow adoption. However, a monetary system does not work the same way as goods or service production, since any businesses ultimately try to earn money. So when your product is the final target of all the business, then you don't need to make profit by selling service, because people will automatically come for your product\nIt is similar to that central banks worry that if the fee of USD transaction is too high, then no one is going to use USD\nPeople do not come to bitcoin to do transaction every day, they are after something that they can not find in fiat money: anti-inflation and anti-censorship and international payment, they should be willing to pay a high fee for these since they could not find these features anywhere else\nIn my opinion, payment function is the least important for bitcoin, if technology allow, it does not hurt to have a little bit more room for more transactions, but it can grow exponentially so eventually the blocks will be full and micro transactions will move offline.

Orphaning is usually just when two miners find blocks at very similar times. Bigger blocks should still be found within the adjusted parameters of difficulty and then shouldn't be any more susceptible to orphaning than the existing size blocks. That's a good question for the dev &amp; tech section though. I can't see how blocksize should have any effect.\n", "author": "QuestionAuthority Legendary Offline Activity: 1960 Merit: 1315 You lead and I'll watch you walk away.

I have also heard a variation of this argument with increasing block size being constrained by hardware resources, internet bandwidth etc.\nTheoretically these arguments are correct, practically they are not.\nThe effect of block size on these costs is almost negligible\nI'm not sure why you say that.

The fact that they also blow up any remaining claim that orphaning risk will act as a natural, if too limited to be at all effectual, control on block size is regrettable but unavoidable.\nIsn't there a little bit of 'chicken-and-egg' here?\nWhy would miners use these new 'efficient schemes'\nin the first place if it was to render the fee market\nineffectual, unless they were already relying on something else\n(blocksize limit) to do that (support a fee market)?\n", "author": "jonald_fyookball Legendary Offline Activity: 1302 Merit: 1002 Core dev leaves me neg feedback #abuse #political "}, {"date": "2016-01-26 02:51:35", "content": "@Gmax I did some sleuthy reconnaissance for you\nhere\n.\n", "author": "BlindMayorBitcorn Legendary Offline Activity: 1176 Merit: 1051 "}, {"date": "2016-01-26 03:04:39", "content": "Isn't there a little bit of 'chicken-and-egg' here?\nWhy would miners use these new 'efficient schemes'\nin the first place if it was to render the fee market\nineffectual, unless they were already relying on something else\n(blocksize limit) to do that (support a fee market)?\nThese schemes reduce orphaning and allow miners to make a greater profit.  It's not hypothetical, Matt's fast block relay protocol is the simplest and least effective of this class of scheme and it is used almost universally today to carry blocks between pools.

[I missed a couple of nuances about that circuit that I now understand]\nThe point of the story is that theoretical models only need to be useful--but we must understand that they are often not perfect.  By ignoring theory, you'll spin your wheels and progress will be slow; but by overstating the validity of a theory, reality will kick you in the butt and show you what you don't know.\nWith the academic work regarding the transaction fee market, what we're doing is considering different lenses through which to view the problem, so that we can make incremental progress in our understanding.  We\nknow\nthat these models are imperfect, but we ask what happens if the assumptions hold, so that we can gain intuition about the more complicated real problem.\nFor example, if we assume that perfect competition exists AND that the marginal cost of block space is zero (the top left square above), then indeed fees go to zero and the Blockchain fills with spam.  I believe Dr. Nicolas Houy was the first to study the problem through that lens in his 2014 paper\n\"The economics of Bitcoin transaction fees.\"\nAlthough the model was obviously simplistic, this paper revealed the interesting insight that a block size limit is economically-equivalant to a fixed-fee requirement.\nIf we assume that miners communicate a non-zero amount of information about the transactions in the block at block-solution time, but still assume perfect competition, then the marginal cost of block space is nonzero and a transaction fee market exists without a block size limit.  I believe I was the first to formally analyze this problem in my\npaper from August 2015\n(the top right square in the table above).  This is obviously simplistic as well because the market won't be perfectly competitive--miners might have some pricing power.\nIf we assume monopoly conditions (the two bottom squares in the table above), then the \"mining cartel\" will enforce a block size limit that maximizes the \"producer surplus\" as shown below.\nReality is somewhere in the middle of all these models.  By doing research and asking ourselves what happens given certain simplifying assumption, we slowly build a deep understanding of the complex real phenomena.\n", "author": "Peter R Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1006 "}, {"date": "2016-01-26 04:00:38", "content": "them utilising the methods Greg describes for sending blocks.\nThe greatest irony is that after that dozen back and forth set of emails where I was completely unable to communicate to Peter R the ability of miners to completely remove the communication delay from the time of mining, amid his irrelevant poetic waxing about information theory...

You want to have the amount of time until the next block is found listed somewhere in the client. Unfortunately, that's not possible.

A \"hash\" is just a random number cryptographically calculated to find a matching number. Miners are simply \"hashing\" a bunch of them until they get lucky. Just like there are many acceptable hashes, there are many different nonces which will work for the same block. But a miner only has to find one of them.

Have not deep technological knowledge (having a totally different profession) of this last but I am able to understand the potential and the superiority of this technology compared to all existing ones with which can be compared or pretend to compete with it.\nMust of us here in bitcointalk know that the very and the first well known successful product of peer to peer is bitcoin. All us here are primarily to discuss and learn more about it, its spread, its qualities, its weaknesses, its future; in few words about everything has to do with it (including its derivatives but yet all peer to peer products). The last months everyone of us was testimonial of the big \"war\" happened within the team of the core developers of bitcoin which has as end the division of this team on two mini teams which will \"create\" and \"build\" everyone its block of bitcoin.\nHere begin my confusion which is even the aim of this thread. Being not a developer for me seems a totally stupidity and bullshit to be such situation only for only 1 MB difference on the increase of the size of the new block of production of bitcoins. But for sure it will be not so. Cannot be a stupidity or a bullshit create such big trouble for a pearl like bitcoin. Must be much more. And if a \"Chinese team\" of developers or creators create the third bitcoin block bitcoin with 8 MB what will happen? Will have three different bitcoin? Or only one but that will have different clothings? What will be the effect of these kind of variants on bitcoin itself, on its use and on its development as a product? Who can explain the why and the next of all this mess? Who can give answers about all write above? And at the end who team have right (giving arguments) and which is the best variant (giving arguments) of the above three size blocks?\nI'm sorry if I'm not correct in something but this is what I have perceived and understand since now.\n", "views": 2272, "author": "n2004al Legendary Offline Activity: 1050 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWho have right and which is the best?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-02-01 13:56:43", "content": "What is going on is purely and simply \"politics\" - there really hasn't been any scientific reasoning used about the need to increase the block size to any particular number (the proposals have changed several times already) but apparently it is \"so urgent\" that Gavin believes that the core devs should have the project taken away from them (and given to a team with only two decent programmers).\nI wouldn't worry too much about it as the miners are not so likely to want to kill their own income by causing Bitcoin to fragment into several alts.\n", "author": "CIYAM Legendary Offline Activity: 1876 Merit: 1000 Ian Knowles - CIYAM Lead Developer "}, {"date": "2016-02-01 14:20:51", "content": "What is going on is purely and simply \"politics\" - there really hasn't been any scientific reasoning used about the need to increase the block size to any particular number (the proposals have changed several times already) but apparently it is \"so urgent\" that Gavin believes that the core devs should have the project taken away from them (and given to a team with only two decent programmers).\nI wouldn't worry too much about it as the miners are not so likely to want to kill their own income by causing Bitcoin to fragment into several alts.\nGood. So my worries are not worthless. Exist the risk that bitcoin be split on other \"minibitcoins\" or in other cryptos which can take several names. Or it is not strange to see even the claim of each team to be the owner of the only real \"bitcoin\". I don't think that the situation is so harmless. At the homepage of bitcoin classic are shown some data and according to my knowledge of the bitcoin market the names which support Gavin are not so few or not important to not be taken in consideration. And to not forget that bitcoin classic is yet in the first days or weeks of its existence. As for the miners I will be not so sure that all them will not support bitcoin classic and there that will be not possible to be other new miners which can support bitcoin classic.\nBut the big problem according to me is another. If it is so easy to \"develop\" a new bitcoin, every year must be created a new team which can create their product as a new and better one; giving always the same name - bitcoin. We all know the power of the bitcoin market of China. If they create their bitcoin half of the market or even more for sure will use their product. Tomorrow may be another team in another emerging market to do the same and so can continue without end. How people have the code of bitcoin?

By design, it had 'greed' incorporated into its protocol but as the POW system  became more consolidated due to big mining farms, the 'greed' factor became less beneficial and more of a burden.

So, in my point of view, make a strong connection between bitcoin and an variant of gambling like poker and thinking or \"selling\" this as an immense good for bitcoin or as an incentive which will bring big spread of it, is totally a wrong and even risky approach of this matter. Gambling and poker cannot be never good for bitcoin because mean first of all lose of money. Statistics tell that in poker lose their money 95% of them who play and win only the remaining 5%. Where is the good here? In losing money? You think that losing money will help people to love bitcoin?

Retep added to my thinking on this by pointing out that anonymization technology lags the already slow bandwidth scaling we see in the broader thinking, and the ability to potentially anonymize all Bitcoin activity is protective against certain failure scenarios.\nMy general preference is to error towards being more decentralized. There are three reasons for this:\n(1) We can build a multitude of systems of different kinds decentralized and centralized ones on top of a strongly decenteralized system but we can't really build something more decentralized on top of something which is less decentralized. The core of Bitcoin sets the maximum amount of decentralization possible in our ecosystem.\n(2) Decentralization is what makes what we're doing unique and valuable compared to the alternatives. If decentralization is not very important to you... you'd likely already be much happier with the USD and paypal.\n(3) Regardless of the block size we need to have robust alternatives for transacting in BTC in order to improve privacy, instant confirmation, lower costs for low value transactions, permit very tiny femtopayments, and to (optionally!) better support reversible transactions. ... and once we do the global blockchain throughput rate is less of an issue: Instead of a limit of how many transactions can be done it becomes a factor that controls how costly the alternatives are allowed to be at worst, and a factor in how often people need to depend on external (usually less secure) systems.\n...and also because I think it's easier to fix if you've gone too small and need to increase it, vs gone too large and shut out the general public from the validation process and handed it over to large entities.\n.\nI think you're mistaking the kind of anonymity being talked about here. Say some random authority wants to force miners to only mine transactions that the authority approves of and not mine any that match some kind of blacklist, and to not extend any chains that contain violations of these rules. If successful this would substantially undermine the purpose and goals of Bitcoin.\nIf it is easy to mine with relatively high anonymity if you can validate on a single high performance server with a commodity consumer grade broadband connection and announce over tor or some other anonymity network it would be difficult to impose such a criteria: too many miners would disappear into the mists if you tried, and so there would be no reason to try. If, instead, running a validating node (much less a miner) requires a rack of expensive equipment and a multi-gigabit network connection that is far less clearly the case.\nYears ago, Greg Maxwell was defending his same arguments, way before Blockstream was founded, and the likes of Mike Hearn were already missing the point, just like you do now.\nAnd lol at \"in your understanding\". You don't even understand why raising the blocksize now is not a good idea, and you are you are trying to understand how the Lightning Network works.

The key itself was most likely invalid, but depending on the software you generated an address from it with, it probably mapped to some address that had some small amount of coins in it but the invalid key means that you cannot import and spend.\n", "author": "achow101 Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1526 Merit: 1600 3F1Y9yquzvY6RWvKbw2n2zeo9V5mvBhADU "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 10:14:55", "content": "Thanks   y'all    for    the    feedback.\nAnyways   there's   no   harm   in   trying\nBut   is   there   another   way   in   the   cryptocurrency   that   can   help   me   achieve   my   goals    in   the   bitcoin   hacking?\n", "author": "max_werber10 Newbie Offline Activity: 10 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 12:05:43", "content": "The amount of energy used to hack a private key can be well used to mine bitcoin- you still stand a chance to find a block.\nForget about hacking addresses.....\n", "author": "7788bitcoin Legendary Offline Activity: 952 Merit: 1000 Presale Starting May 1st "}], "date": "2016-02-01 13:34:49"}, {"content": "Do you guys already try the new Blockchain.info UI that has some new features?\n", "views": 885, "author": "Jeremycoin Legendary Offline Activity: 924 Merit: 1003 𝓗𝓞𝓓𝓛 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNew Blockchain.info UI\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-02-02 01:34:51", "content": "Not yet since to do so, we have to upgrade to the beta version in which limits the functions users could do with the current version as opposed to the beta version and base on replies users got from supports, by doing so, you can't go back if something goes wrong (which have already for some) and you could check some of the comments in the following thread:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1344049.0\n", "author": "SFR10 Legendary Offline Activity: 1204 Merit: 1135 SFR DESIGNS - http://bit.ly/2ClWYOh "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 03:32:05", "content": "im afraid so is it  in beta? i havent tried it, got to read reviews and comments first.\n", "author": "bitraine Sr. Member Offline Activity: 349 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 05:57:41", "content": "Their code have been so buggy in the past, I would much rather wait until all the holes are wrinkled out.

The original block in the blockchain was encoded with a bleak snapshot of the failing financial system, a small quote from the UK Times newspaper:  Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\nIt was banks, central control and corrupt government policy, that the fledgling cryptocurrency was hoping to replace. While it has not yet overthrown the financial institutions of old, nearly 7 years on its still closer to doing so than many people had imagined.\nLike all groundbreaking technologies there were technical teething problems, naysayers and outright battles. Some governments tried to outlaw its use (and some have succeeded). The negative PR stemming from the currencys ties to the illegal dark net markets may have scared some people off. And the early adopters were well and truly screwed over when they stored their digital funds in the Mt. Gox exchange, because hundreds of millions of dollars worth went missing.\nYet here were are, closing in on 2016 and bitcoin is alive and well. In fact its doing better than ever and our new infographic demonstrates that the only way is up, in terms of value and usage.\nIndeed the dollar price of BTC has been steadily rising since the start of the year, regaining ground after its first major crash. In just the past 3 months it has doubled its value by a $200 increase and theres no sign of that slowing down as 2016 emerges.\nAs for the actual trading volume at the exchanges and the overall growth of the exchanges themselves  well both are skyrocketing. From October 2014 to October 2015, OK Coin from Singapore has grown 847%, and even the more western-centric BitStamp has doubled within the year. The market is managing to move $289 million worth of BTC on a daily basis, more than Western Union ($216m) and closing in on PayPal ($397m).\nMeanwhile online and offline merchants are increasingly adding bitcoin as a payment method, supported by bitcoin payment service providers such as Coinify, Europes leader in processing wide range of digital currency payments. Not just to keep customers happy but because it actually costs them less to process. A negligible 1% is charged for BitPay premium members compared to the major credit card networks, which range between 2% and 6%. This has contributed to the jump from 65,000 merchants accepting BTC to 100,000 plus. While we can imagine some scenarios where it isnt beneficial to the customer, retailers like TigerDirect are proud to reveal that bitcoin prevents fraudulent chargebacks which are very common with customers using credit cards.\nIn short all you really need to know is that giants like Microsoft, Expedia and Time Inc. have embraced BTC and many others are following suit. August 2015 saw BitPays most successful month, recording 70,000 transactions.\nIn turn, as this demand has increased so has the venture capital funding the user-friendly apps, bitcoin ATMs, exchanges, and other technology. In 2012 only $2 million was pumped in to the industry. So far in 2015 this has reached $469 million!\nPerhaps the last remaining concern for the bitcoin revolution is overcoming volatility, the freak fluctuations in value. Thankfully the facts dont lie. As the market has grown the impact of panic and large volume trading has lessened. From 2011 to 2015 the line is quite simply going down. For regular traders who exploit volatility this might not be good, but for those who want a simple electronic currency that is out of the reach of the old monetary guard, then were on the revolutionary track that Satoshi Nakamoto laid down.\n", "author": "russian_pete Member Offline Activity: 66 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 03:19:32", "content": "bitcoin is increasing as average per day, there no dump ever,\nall those fluctuation are there for accumulation only\nif you count since when bitcoin was born, we are actually always increasing, even in 2014 yes...\nThe bolded part of your quote above is what most people on this forum, or in the larger bitcoin community in general, fail to appreciate.

Bitcoin offers pseudo anonymity and more security from confiscation. Using a checking account for small amounts isn't too big a risk but the bank knows your business. Keeping a large sum there makes it possible to lose it via a \"bail in\" if you believe our economic system is close to collapse (many solid economics thinks so). With banks paying near zero interest then commodities like gold and silver are more secure and the loss of interest on them is not a big deal. But you can't send silver or gold through the Internet. Now Bitcoin compared to credit cards seems like a no-brainer. Bitcoin doesn't send your identity. No one can make fraudulent charges after they steal your Bitcoin number. Yes, I'm aware that you can call the bank and BEG them to take the charges off, threaten them that you will stop using their services if they don't and whatever else but because you pander to 'the credit rating\" they have you by the shorthairs. The merchants have everything to gain and nothing to lose by using Bitcoin. Will credit card fraud increase or decrease? Identity theft?

How long did it take the transaction to confirm? How many parties were involved in confirming the transaction? Did I need to be connected to the Internet to do it?\nChecks can clear absolutely instantly at banks. There is no need for blocks to be solved, confirmations from third parties or anything else. The reason they take some time to clear is not because of some wizard level problem. It is because a check is a piece of paper someone wrote some amount on.\nThe check writer may not have the money or the check may be forged, that's why it takes a while to clear. Why do people use checks? Because they are really easy to use, if you have a guy working on your plumbing, you can write him a check when he is done. The plumber doesn't need any kind of computer to accept the check and can just put it in his pocket. No merchant processors, no need to connect to the Internet, no bitcoin addresses, no confirmations.\nWith a U.S. bank, you have a whole host of options when you want to pay someone:\n- paper check\n- paper cashiers check from the bank account (funds are guaranteed)\n- electronic transfer (including via email address or mobile phone number)\n- recurring automatic electronic transfers\n- wire transfer\n- debit card (most have the money in the account, receiver needs merchant account)\n- credit card (borrowed money, receiver needs merchant account)\nThose are the most common.

Bitcoin\nnot having a negative interest is just another bonus down the road.\nIf you are Canadian they just passed the negative interest rate as potential feature if the markets dictate it is needed.\nForget which country just went into negative interest rates to potentially spur the ecomomy from saving and spending more to push the economy forward. Most likely come to me after posting and believe it was Japan,but could be wrong.\nPlease understand that your understanding of economics is actually *worse* than your grammar.\nWhen 1BTC was worth $430 a month ago and is now worth $373, saying that Bitcoin has no negative interest rate is meaningless.\nAgain you have gone off on a tangent to make a point.

How long did it take the transaction to confirm? How many parties were involved in confirming the transaction? Did I need to be connected to the Internet to do it?\nChecks can clear absolutely instantly at banks. There is no need for blocks to be solved, confirmations from third parties or anything else. The reason they take some time to clear is not because of some wizard level problem. It is because a check is a piece of paper someone wrote some amount on.\nThe check writer may not have the money or the check may be forged, that's why it takes a while to clear. Why do people use checks? Because they are really easy to use, if you have a guy working on your plumbing, you can write him a check when he is done. The plumber doesn't need any kind of computer to accept the check and can just put it in his pocket. No merchant processors, no need to connect to the Internet, no bitcoin addresses, no confirmations.\nWith a U.S. bank, you have a whole host of options when you want to pay someone:\n- paper check\n- paper cashiers check from the bank account (funds are guaranteed)\n- electronic transfer (including via email address or mobile phone number)\n- recurring automatic electronic transfers\n- wire transfer\n- debit card (most have the money in the account, receiver needs merchant account)\n- credit card (borrowed money, receiver needs merchant account)\nThose are the most common. Banks have zero use for crypto currency, things work great as it is.\nBanking is not free. Your costs are being subsidised by other people's charges.\nAs stated above, I cashed a cheque last week.

Which would have been better both for you &amp; Granny -- she's just enabling you, should let you hit rock-bottom.\nThe great thing about Bitcoin is that it allows those who are bankless to participate in the global economy....And, it provides a platform by which one can interact within the digital economy on a micro-scale which benefits consumers of intellectual content, as well as, the artists who produce it.\nWho are these works of fiction? Why can't they buy prepaid cards, at their local bodegas, but can buy bitcoins?\n'S far as microtransactions go, forget about those. Because \"[Bitcoin transactions currently cost] $373 * 25BTC / 2.7tps * (600sec per block) =\n~$5.75 + tx fee, per fucking transaction.\nYou don't pay it because it's currently subsidized by Bitcoin base money inflation, i.e. printing 25 bitcoins out of thin air every 10 minutes.\"\nThere are some places in the world that do not have \"local bodegas\" and there are others that are in extreme turmoil due conflict and unrest....In fact, I used to think like you until I found out that not every city in the world has a 7-Eleven on all their corners.  I don't know, it's just nice that those who are struggling in third world nations have an outlet to participate in commerce when they need it.  Countries whose economy is suffering with hyper-inflation, at least, have the option to store their assets in bitcoin to secure their holdings...Zimbabwe for example.\nThose places without local bodegas, in social turmoil, full of unbanked -- their commerce is Bitcoin-based, you say? Or do they order shit on the internet, via universal free sat uplinks?\nDo you know that\n\"Nearly half the world's population, 2.8 billion people, survive on less than $2 a day\"\n? These are the people who are going to flock to Bitcoin? To buy angora socks on AlphaBay, I take it?\nWhere do you get these weird fantasies?\nP.S. Inflation is a *rich people problem*.  When you're living on &lt; $2 a day, ain't much money sitting in the bank. 4realsies.\nNo, they're the shoeless one's raising the rabbits, processing the fur, and producing the angora socks to sell to the bourgeoisie so that they can earn enough to feed their children.\nThese are figments of your imagination, like pink elephants and the bugs crawling under your skin after you do too much shitty DNM crank -- not real, they do not exist.\nStop concocting these outlandish fantasies -- you won't reconcile your trying to get rich by buying\nBTC\neanies &amp; sitting on your butt with basic human ethics, sorry.\nPut me in touch with *one* person like that, *ONE*. Then we'll talk.\nP.S. No need to thank me for letting you advertise that dice site in your sig.\nHere are some real world cases:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTVWasymExg\nP.S.  More than dice....Poker's my thing....But, thank you anyway....Capitalism at it's best!\nLol, this is exactly what I mean: you're being fed bullshit. Already addressed her:\n...\nNo one is giving out any (meaningful sums of) Bitcoins in Africa. The last thing I heard was some BitPesa\n3dpd\nlady taking Safaricom to Kenyan High Court because \"BAWW, payment processors don't want to play with us.\"\n...and LOSING!!\nEveryone wants to *make money* on 3rd-world countries. These are not nice people. Bitcoiners are banksters too, only worse.

It is highly possible that such situation given at the main post cam be verified. Normally every new thing is an improvement of something old. Even bitcoin was and is a qualitative technological improvement. So remain to think and to decide what to do with our bitcoins. I have chosen time ago what to do. Diversification of my amount of bitcoins in other cryptos and the hold only of some of those.

They would never consider telling a lie of such magnitude themselves, or knowing that it would require such impudence, they would not consider it possible for it to be told by others.

instance VC's hand miners FIAT to pay the electric. and the miners hand bitcoins to the VC as their returns. that way funds dont actually touch public exchanges..\neven things like bitpay received 30+million in fiat a couple years ago and they used the fiat to pay customers and gave the bitcoin to VC's, without needing to touch exchanges as often as you would think.\nsecondly. if miners are losing funds due to VC's not accepting their transactions (due to threat of orphaning.. then miners would downgrade to mitigate the risk of orphans or go offline temporarily to conserve costs..

orphans\n2. they had enough hash power to tip the scales in their favour without loss\n3. they had community relaying support to ensure their blocks got relayed.\n4. their not mentally retarded to risk more processing time, orphans or going offline which would be 3 slaps in the face, for just being to eager.\ninstead they would wait it out until the time was right. even if gavins 'few week' predicted timescale elapses, miners just wont move forward until they are sure.\nthis is also the reason miners dont upgrade their mining software as often. as they like to let the community test out new software before risking using it on a pool.\nif you think that accepting more transactions(fees) is more important compared to long term regular income.. you are wrong.\ncurrently fee's average 0.4btc total per block. if you think they are going to let in another 100 transactions (1.05mb instead of 0.99mb) just to get 0.42btc while risking their opportunities for multiple long term earnings of 12.5btc.. well im guessing you prefer the conspiracy theory more than logic theory.\nsome miners may be mentally impaired and try pushing beyond the 1mb limit prematurely, but they will find their attempts cost them if they dont have all the other factors ready to protect them and the community, and so the are just shooting themselves in the foot and only hurting themselves in the end. and so eventually they will adjust down to start earning again and wait for a better time to adjust up again, or the rest of the community will grow to allow miners to move forward sooner.. or the miner will

Some really great information here, what a great thread. Can I give a newbie summary as I see it, and please correct me where I am wrong.\nThere are two main camps.\nSegWit who want to extend the functionality of Bitcoin, and as part of this extension, they want to split the transaction for storage in two chains (is this correct?) The important section regarding the amount of the transfer and the history link stay in the existing blockchain, but because of the reduction in information, more transactions can be stored in a block. This solves the size problem in the short term, and still allows for an upgrade to 2Mb blocks when traffic volumes have increased in the future. This could become effective fairly quickly.\nDouble blocks want to double the size of the blocks as a temporary solution, and then increase them again in the future as traffic continues to increase, They believe that this can be implemented immediately. Whilst the code changes could be incorporated quickly, it seems to me that no miner would produce blocks over 1Mb in case the SegWit fork wins, and they lose their income. Thus the 2Mb change will not be effective until the fork dispute is resolved.\nIf core includes some of the other enhancements with SegWit, then wouldn't that become the popular choice of nodes?

But I'll stick to a claim that some prominent Core dev stated that analysis of recent blocks led to this figure.\nOthers I have seen use a 4x figure - totally dependent upon an assumption that multisig become a much larger portion of the transaction volume.\nFor this little branch of the discussion, the salient point is that any node that performs validation (i.e. any node operating in a trustless manner) must process not the claimed 1MB block size worth of data, but an amount of data that reflects the signature data as well - 1MB multiplied by this (instantaneous) scaling factor, be it 1.75x, 4x, or whatever else represents the proportion of signature data associated with the transactions included in that block.\n", "author": "jbreher Legendary Offline Activity: 2142 Merit: 1089 lose: unfind ... loose: untight "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 19:44:59", "content": "If you are really interested in why 75% is not enough, the definitive answer is found here:\nhttp://organofcorti.blogspot.com/2015/08/bip101-implementation-flaws.html\nBecause the stated 75% criteria produces a negligible yet discernible chance that we get a false trigger at an actual 67% adoption rate due to variance?

OrganOfCorti's post seems to focus upon mathematics, yours seems to focus upon hysteria. Shall we analyze this together?\nThe damning part of the analysis is specific to BIP 101, and assumes 'vote spoofing' upon the part of nefarious actors. Such is fine, and important in regards to analyzing the BIP 101 situation. However, you present it as if it is  universally-applicable to any 75% proposal. 'Flaw #3' is inapplicable to any situation where the tabulation of 75% is strictly based upon hash power.\nSo yes, it seems to me that you are trolling.\nEven so, there is an admitted latent issue with the order of magnitude in the comments, unaddressed for months.\nAnonymous31 August 2015 at 03:46\n&gt; The number of failure attempts before a success occurs in trials of this type is called a geometrically distributed random variable, and can be used to find the probability of some arbitrary true proportion resulting in more than 749 blocks of a sequential 1,000, after that true proportion has been present for some number of blocks.\nThis is incorrect, as overlapping sequences are extremely correlated. Treating overlapping sequences as independent trials will massively overestimate the chances of success. The expected time for a 0.7 proportion of hashrate to result in a 0.75 proportion of blocks is closer to 300,000.\nhttp://bitco.in/forum/threads/triggering-the-bip101-fork-early-with-less-than-75-miners.13/\nReply\nOrgan Ofcorti31 August 2015 at 16:18\nYes and I feel a bit silly about missing that! I realised it after a redditor commented:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ilwq1/bip101_implementation_flaws/cuhy71q\nI'll be posting an update after I get the weekly stats out. I haven't had time to figure out an analytical approach, but I'll generate some nice plots based on simulations.\nOr more importantly, the amount of time for variance to result in a false trigger is important. The other analysis in the quoted comment above puts the chance as \"\nTL;DR: At anything less than 70% of steady hashrate, triggering a fork would take at least 6 years, and gets exponentially less likely as miner share decreases.\n\"\nEven the bulk of Core devs are seeming to claim that it will be necessary in the not-too-distant future to increase the block size. Just not now. For some unstated reason. If variance results in a trigger after Core would have already increased the block size anyhow, then the trigger is a non-event. No chain fork results.

here goes\nA.\nthis scenario is where just one miner with the most hash power compared to any other\nsingle\nminer.\nalthough it appear the miner has 27% of hash power, effectively because it is adding more transactions the processing time is longer so the 'feel' of the hashing speed is more like 24%, thus its not going to be racing ahead making longer chains and only has 1 turn on average every 4 blocks to win.\nthus with 90% consensus against it.. that 1 block out of 4 would get orphaned because the other 90% would ignore it and the next block they add wont have the over1mb block in its chain.\nso there are 2 defenses, not enough hashpower to race ahead with over 1mb blockheights, and not enough peer consensus (nodes running same implementation).\nB.\nthis is where there is a hashrate power of over 75%. but even in this case there is only 40% peer consensus, and so with all 10 miners connecting together to show each other a solved block. 6 out of 10 would orphan off that over1mb block. a bit more complicated to explain, but basically the end result is that eventually there is still just 1 chain of the under 1mb blocks, once the miners communicate and sort out the orphans.\nC.\nthis is where there is 75% of peer consensus where the hashrate is over 90%. in this case the majority wins on both counts and the minority (under1mb) gets left behind with a chain that does not sync up.\nremember. 2mb rule allows both under 1mb blocks and over1mb blocks.. so even if a 2mb consensus has not been reached the 2mb implementations would still happily accept the valid under1mb rules.. there would not be any hard forks as orphaning will rejoin any disputing blocks.\nhowever old 1mb implementations, if they lose dominance in both counts. will end up with:\n1. having a chain that doesnt sync up because it rejects the majority of blocks\n2. the amount of peer nodes with an altnative chain would be limited.\n3. miners who continue to mine in the minority wont be able to spend the efforts as its rejected.\n4. would have to upgrade to regain sync ability and earning potential.\nbut as i say. this is only a concern for those that dont upgrade to a 2mb implementation. and only then if scenario C came into play.\nso there is no issue in users having a 2mb implementation, where the setting just sits there as a buffer, doing nothing until scenario C comes about.\nwhat is more disasterous. is that bitcoin-core refuses to code a 2mb implementation which means if a scenario C came about.. the entire community would be left behind with unsync-able nodes.\nso just as a line of safety for the possibility of something happening in the next 3 years, its far better to allow users to have the setting there, just as a buffer.. than to refuse to give people the buffer and scream that the disaster is someone elses fault.\nas i said having the setting for users, is not a call to arms. its not a red nuclear button. its just a setting that sits there as a buffer.. just like the 1mb limit was just a buffer while miners were making only 0-500k blocks in 2009-2013.\nminers logic and psychology shows and proves that they wont risk adding more transactions (increasing processing time) if they think there blocks will get orphaned. and so they are not going to jump the gun. its not in their financial interest to do so unless the community is ready to accept their blocks, so they can atleast spend their rewards.\nand anyone trying to imply nefarious intent of some miners.. ill refer you to scenario A, and possibly B(if collusion and naferious intent are combined). but in general long term reward earnings outweight possibility of short term nefarious intent. so relax\nnow onto bitcoin-core\nwe all know, bitcoin-core is a full node client. anyone interested in being a full node in april will need to upgrade to remain full node status, due to segwit. otherwise they are automatically causing their non-upgraded clients to become \"compatible\" nodes. not full validation nodes.\nso knowing full nodes will be upgrading just to stay full node status. i think the April update should also include the 2mb setting buffer. that way even 3 years later or 6 months.. whenever the miners feel comfortable to be scenario C.. it wont impact the community because the community is already prepared.\nremember the 2mb rule is not a rule that says \"you have to accept blocks over 1mb\". its not a nuclear launchcode of bloat.\nits a buffer setting of \"anything from 0b to 2mb\" which includes normal blocks as they stand today.\nagain just like the 1mb was a buffer while miners were happy below 500k a few years back\nso while miners stick safely to their 1mb rule the community can happily be prepared for 2mb possibilities of the future.\nif bitcoin-core refuses to prepare the community before miners act.. then it would be bitcoin-cores fault for users not being able to sync once consensus has been reached.\nill just leave

Tyra explains Bitcoin's potential effects to the accounting profession. In the article he writes\n\"Double entry bookkeeping revolutionized the field of financial accounting during the Renaissance period. Whereas simple ledgers had long been the standard for record keeping for merchants, the church and state treasuries, the growth of long distance trade and creation of the first joint stock companies resulted in firms whose records were too voluminous and complicated to provide any assurance of accuracy to their users.The double entry system solved the problem of managers knowing whether they could trust their own books.\"\nDouble entry accounting changed human history. It essentially enabled the employer-employee relationships to develop and, without them, companies such as Ford, IBM or Google would not be possible. The key benefit was that double entry accounting enabled bookkeeping practices to be used to help make sure the parties to the employment contracts were remaining honest.\n", "views": 245, "author": "Bungeebones Full Member Offline Activity: 180 Merit: 100 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow might Bitcoin impact employee/employer relations?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-02-02 20:27:32", "content": "its got a Gazillion innovations, the US Fed gov must be packing bricks\ni can see an massive Silicon Valley based shift n US politics\n", "author": "Bitcoinpro Legendary Offline Activity: 1218 Merit: 1000 "}], "date": "2016-02-02 20:18:58"}, {"content": "Hi many people like Peter Rs presentation about fee market. I disagree with him and wrote a blog post why.\nhttp://danielwilczynski.com/2015/11/30/why-peter-rs-fee-market-wont-work\nAt the first Scaling Bitcoin conference Peter R presented his ideas on why a fee market would exist without a block size limit. You can see his presentation here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad0Pjj_ms2k\n.\nHe is wrong and I will explain why.\nPeter says that a non-zero supply curve exists because increasing block size increases cost to miners due to higher orphan rate. I have also heard a variation of this argument with increasing block size being constrained by hardware resources, internet bandwidth etc.\nTheoretically these arguments are correct, practically they are not.\nThe effect of block size on these costs is almost negligible.\nThe supply curve is not exactly flat but very close to it. It is practically (if not theoretically)  flat and at zero. In reality a fee market will not form.\nAs an example, we have a supply and demand curve for oxygen but there is no real market for it because its impractical for something so cheap with such a flat and low curve. Yes, Oxygen does have a supply curve because humans are capable of increasing its supply at an increasing cost.\nWhen curves meet at extremes the market breaks down.\nNo block size limit would simply result in huge blocks and a much more centralised node network, that can be easier influenced by governments.\nBut lets ignore all of the above for a second.\nPeter also says we need at least 2 mining pools, for a market to form based on the orphan rate cost. Of course you hardly have much of a market with 2 pools, or 5-10 pools. That is what we have now. You can not have a real efficient market for orphan rates with only a few participants at one end.\nFurthermore, orphan rate is a result of block propagation and can be decreased by moving pools closer together geographically. That is obviously very negative if we are trying to prevent mining centralisation.\nYou might ask, why can a fee market form with fixed block-size supply then? After-all we still have only a small number of pools? The reason is, that in Peters model the cost variable is due to the differing orphan rate between pools. That is not true for fixed block size. There is no variable for the supply curve. Thats why the supply curve is a straight vertical line.\nFinally Peter refers to the block size limit as some artificial centrally controlled limit.\nHe does raise a good and important point here. In the situation of a fee-market based on limited block size. What would be the mechanism for changing the block-size limit and who would have control? The solutions from Peter R or others did not satisfy me personally. It is a valid question though. Are we to have a hard-fork each time we decide the fees are getting too high or low?  Do we implement code to allow a semi-centralised authority to decide? These do not seem like good solutions.\nTo say it is a centrally controlled limit is wrong however. To change the limit needs the consensus of the network i.e. nodes. Core developers have some limited ability to influence people, but ultimately they can not force through any change by themselves, they need the networks tacit agreement. Nobody and everybody controls the limit. Its control is decentralised (and therefore hard to change).\nFinally there is nothing exceptionally artificial about the limit. Bitcoin itself is artificial, the 21 million limit is also an arbitrary artificial limit. Humans set the parameters of Bitcoin, its supply and its block size limit. The problem and difference is the 21 million limit does not have to change. Block size limit might have to, how will that be decided?\n", "views": 5389, "author": "danielW Sr. Member Offline Activity: 277 Merit: 250 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy Peter Rs Fee Market Wont Work\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-01-23 01:41:36", "content": "I have read and thought about what you are saying and\nfirst of all, thank you for reading and peer reviewing\nPeter's paper.\nLet's discuss.\nI would like to believe that Peter is correct but\nI'm open minded enough to consider that he may not be.\nI want to understand more clearly what you are saying and why.\nPeter says that a non-zero supply curve exists because increasing block size increases cost to miners due to higher orphan rate.

The problem and difference is the 21 million limit does not have to change. Block size limit might have to, how will that be decided?\nYes, in fact his model indicated that in order to accept large blocks to earn more fee income, miners should use centralized large data center and relay network to speed up their communication and reduce the orphan cost. That's exactly the worst result from decentralization point of view, and his model does not calculate the value of decentralization, thus is too simplified\nIt is also interesting that you mentioned that all the limit in bitcoin is artificial. So if you could find a good reason why block size should be limited then that limit is possible to be accepted by the majority of the participants, similar to 21 million coin supply\nCurrently all the arguments that \"block should not be full\" borrow the typical reasoning from production and service industry: A higher cost for consumer will slow adoption. However, a monetary system does not work the same way as goods or service production, since any businesses ultimately try to earn money. So when your product is the final target of all the business, then you don't need to make profit by selling service, because people will automatically come for your product\nIt is similar to that central banks worry that if the fee of USD transaction is too high, then no one is going to use USD\nPeople do not come to bitcoin to do transaction every day, they are after something that they can not find in fiat money: anti-inflation and anti-censorship and international payment, they should be willing to pay a high fee for these since they could not find these features anywhere else\nIn my opinion, payment function is the least important for bitcoin, if technology allow, it does not hurt to have a little bit more room for more transactions, but it can grow exponentially so eventually the blocks will be full and micro transactions will move offline.

Orphaning is usually just when two miners find blocks at very similar times. Bigger blocks should still be found within the adjusted parameters of difficulty and then shouldn't be any more susceptible to orphaning than the existing size blocks. That's a good question for the dev &amp; tech section though. I can't see how blocksize should have any effect.\n", "author": "QuestionAuthority Legendary Offline Activity: 1960 Merit: 1315 You lead and I'll watch you walk away.

I have also heard a variation of this argument with increasing block size being constrained by hardware resources, internet bandwidth etc.\nTheoretically these arguments are correct, practically they are not.\nThe effect of block size on these costs is almost negligible\nI'm not sure why you say that.

The fact that they also blow up any remaining claim that orphaning risk will act as a natural, if too limited to be at all effectual, control on block size is regrettable but unavoidable.\nIsn't there a little bit of 'chicken-and-egg' here?\nWhy would miners use these new 'efficient schemes'\nin the first place if it was to render the fee market\nineffectual, unless they were already relying on something else\n(blocksize limit) to do that (support a fee market)?\n", "author": "jonald_fyookball Legendary Offline Activity: 1302 Merit: 1002 Core dev leaves me neg feedback #abuse #political "}, {"date": "2016-01-26 02:51:35", "content": "@Gmax I did some sleuthy reconnaissance for you\nhere\n.\n", "author": "BlindMayorBitcorn Legendary Offline Activity: 1176 Merit: 1051 "}, {"date": "2016-01-26 03:04:39", "content": "Isn't there a little bit of 'chicken-and-egg' here?\nWhy would miners use these new 'efficient schemes'\nin the first place if it was to render the fee market\nineffectual, unless they were already relying on something else\n(blocksize limit) to do that (support a fee market)?\nThese schemes reduce orphaning and allow miners to make a greater profit.  It's not hypothetical, Matt's fast block relay protocol is the simplest and least effective of this class of scheme and it is used almost universally today to carry blocks between pools.

[I missed a couple of nuances about that circuit that I now understand]\nThe point of the story is that theoretical models only need to be useful--but we must understand that they are often not perfect.  By ignoring theory, you'll spin your wheels and progress will be slow; but by overstating the validity of a theory, reality will kick you in the butt and show you what you don't know.\nWith the academic work regarding the transaction fee market, what we're doing is considering different lenses through which to view the problem, so that we can make incremental progress in our understanding.  We\nknow\nthat these models are imperfect, but we ask what happens if the assumptions hold, so that we can gain intuition about the more complicated real problem.\nFor example, if we assume that perfect competition exists AND that the marginal cost of block space is zero (the top left square above), then indeed fees go to zero and the Blockchain fills with spam.  I believe Dr. Nicolas Houy was the first to study the problem through that lens in his 2014 paper\n\"The economics of Bitcoin transaction fees.\"\nAlthough the model was obviously simplistic, this paper revealed the interesting insight that a block size limit is economically-equivalant to a fixed-fee requirement.\nIf we assume that miners communicate a non-zero amount of information about the transactions in the block at block-solution time, but still assume perfect competition, then the marginal cost of block space is nonzero and a transaction fee market exists without a block size limit.  I believe I was the first to formally analyze this problem in my\npaper from August 2015\n(the top right square in the table above).  This is obviously simplistic as well because the market won't be perfectly competitive--miners might have some pricing power.\nIf we assume monopoly conditions (the two bottom squares in the table above), then the \"mining cartel\" will enforce a block size limit that maximizes the \"producer surplus\" as shown below.\nReality is somewhere in the middle of all these models.  By doing research and asking ourselves what happens given certain simplifying assumption, we slowly build a deep understanding of the complex real phenomena.\n", "author": "Peter R Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1006 "}, {"date": "2016-01-26 04:00:38", "content": "them utilising the methods Greg describes for sending blocks.\nThe greatest irony is that after that dozen back and forth set of emails where I was completely unable to communicate to Peter R the ability of miners to completely remove the communication delay from the time of mining, amid his irrelevant poetic waxing about information theory...

You want to have the amount of time until the next block is found listed somewhere in the client. Unfortunately, that's not possible.

A \"hash\" is just a random number cryptographically calculated to find a matching number. Miners are simply \"hashing\" a bunch of them until they get lucky. Just like there are many acceptable hashes, there are many different nonces which will work for the same block. But a miner only has to find one of them.

Have not deep technological knowledge (having a totally different profession) of this last but I am able to understand the potential and the superiority of this technology compared to all existing ones with which can be compared or pretend to compete with it.\nMust of us here in bitcointalk know that the very and the first well known successful product of peer to peer is bitcoin. All us here are primarily to discuss and learn more about it, its spread, its qualities, its weaknesses, its future; in few words about everything has to do with it (including its derivatives but yet all peer to peer products). The last months everyone of us was testimonial of the big \"war\" happened within the team of the core developers of bitcoin which has as end the division of this team on two mini teams which will \"create\" and \"build\" everyone its block of bitcoin.\nHere begin my confusion which is even the aim of this thread. Being not a developer for me seems a totally stupidity and bullshit to be such situation only for only 1 MB difference on the increase of the size of the new block of production of bitcoins. But for sure it will be not so. Cannot be a stupidity or a bullshit create such big trouble for a pearl like bitcoin. Must be much more. And if a \"Chinese team\" of developers or creators create the third bitcoin block bitcoin with 8 MB what will happen? Will have three different bitcoin? Or only one but that will have different clothings? What will be the effect of these kind of variants on bitcoin itself, on its use and on its development as a product? Who can explain the why and the next of all this mess? Who can give answers about all write above? And at the end who team have right (giving arguments) and which is the best variant (giving arguments) of the above three size blocks?\nI'm sorry if I'm not correct in something but this is what I have perceived and understand since now.\n", "views": 2272, "author": "n2004al Legendary Offline Activity: 1050 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWho have right and which is the best?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-02-01 13:56:43", "content": "What is going on is purely and simply \"politics\" - there really hasn't been any scientific reasoning used about the need to increase the block size to any particular number (the proposals have changed several times already) but apparently it is \"so urgent\" that Gavin believes that the core devs should have the project taken away from them (and given to a team with only two decent programmers).\nI wouldn't worry too much about it as the miners are not so likely to want to kill their own income by causing Bitcoin to fragment into several alts.\n", "author": "CIYAM Legendary Offline Activity: 1876 Merit: 1000 Ian Knowles - CIYAM Lead Developer "}, {"date": "2016-02-01 14:20:51", "content": "What is going on is purely and simply \"politics\" - there really hasn't been any scientific reasoning used about the need to increase the block size to any particular number (the proposals have changed several times already) but apparently it is \"so urgent\" that Gavin believes that the core devs should have the project taken away from them (and given to a team with only two decent programmers).\nI wouldn't worry too much about it as the miners are not so likely to want to kill their own income by causing Bitcoin to fragment into several alts.\nGood. So my worries are not worthless. Exist the risk that bitcoin be split on other \"minibitcoins\" or in other cryptos which can take several names. Or it is not strange to see even the claim of each team to be the owner of the only real \"bitcoin\". I don't think that the situation is so harmless. At the homepage of bitcoin classic are shown some data and according to my knowledge of the bitcoin market the names which support Gavin are not so few or not important to not be taken in consideration. And to not forget that bitcoin classic is yet in the first days or weeks of its existence. As for the miners I will be not so sure that all them will not support bitcoin classic and there that will be not possible to be other new miners which can support bitcoin classic.\nBut the big problem according to me is another. If it is so easy to \"develop\" a new bitcoin, every year must be created a new team which can create their product as a new and better one; giving always the same name - bitcoin. We all know the power of the bitcoin market of China. If they create their bitcoin half of the market or even more for sure will use their product. Tomorrow may be another team in another emerging market to do the same and so can continue without end. How people have the code of bitcoin?

By design, it had 'greed' incorporated into its protocol but as the POW system  became more consolidated due to big mining farms, the 'greed' factor became less beneficial and more of a burden.

So, in my point of view, make a strong connection between bitcoin and an variant of gambling like poker and thinking or \"selling\" this as an immense good for bitcoin or as an incentive which will bring big spread of it, is totally a wrong and even risky approach of this matter. Gambling and poker cannot be never good for bitcoin because mean first of all lose of money. Statistics tell that in poker lose their money 95% of them who play and win only the remaining 5%. Where is the good here? In losing money? You think that losing money will help people to love bitcoin?

Retep added to my thinking on this by pointing out that anonymization technology lags the already slow bandwidth scaling we see in the broader thinking, and the ability to potentially anonymize all Bitcoin activity is protective against certain failure scenarios.\nMy general preference is to error towards being more decentralized. There are three reasons for this:\n(1) We can build a multitude of systems of different kinds decentralized and centralized ones on top of a strongly decenteralized system but we can't really build something more decentralized on top of something which is less decentralized. The core of Bitcoin sets the maximum amount of decentralization possible in our ecosystem.\n(2) Decentralization is what makes what we're doing unique and valuable compared to the alternatives. If decentralization is not very important to you... you'd likely already be much happier with the USD and paypal.\n(3) Regardless of the block size we need to have robust alternatives for transacting in BTC in order to improve privacy, instant confirmation, lower costs for low value transactions, permit very tiny femtopayments, and to (optionally!) better support reversible transactions. ... and once we do the global blockchain throughput rate is less of an issue: Instead of a limit of how many transactions can be done it becomes a factor that controls how costly the alternatives are allowed to be at worst, and a factor in how often people need to depend on external (usually less secure) systems.\n...and also because I think it's easier to fix if you've gone too small and need to increase it, vs gone too large and shut out the general public from the validation process and handed it over to large entities.\n.\nI think you're mistaking the kind of anonymity being talked about here. Say some random authority wants to force miners to only mine transactions that the authority approves of and not mine any that match some kind of blacklist, and to not extend any chains that contain violations of these rules. If successful this would substantially undermine the purpose and goals of Bitcoin.\nIf it is easy to mine with relatively high anonymity if you can validate on a single high performance server with a commodity consumer grade broadband connection and announce over tor or some other anonymity network it would be difficult to impose such a criteria: too many miners would disappear into the mists if you tried, and so there would be no reason to try. If, instead, running a validating node (much less a miner) requires a rack of expensive equipment and a multi-gigabit network connection that is far less clearly the case.\nYears ago, Greg Maxwell was defending his same arguments, way before Blockstream was founded, and the likes of Mike Hearn were already missing the point, just like you do now.\nAnd lol at \"in your understanding\". You don't even understand why raising the blocksize now is not a good idea, and you are you are trying to understand how the Lightning Network works.

The key itself was most likely invalid, but depending on the software you generated an address from it with, it probably mapped to some address that had some small amount of coins in it but the invalid key means that you cannot import and spend.\n", "author": "achow101 Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1526 Merit: 1600 3F1Y9yquzvY6RWvKbw2n2zeo9V5mvBhADU "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 10:14:55", "content": "Thanks   y'all    for    the    feedback.\nAnyways   there's   no   harm   in   trying\nBut   is   there   another   way   in   the   cryptocurrency   that   can   help   me   achieve   my   goals    in   the   bitcoin   hacking?\n", "author": "max_werber10 Newbie Offline Activity: 10 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 12:05:43", "content": "The amount of energy used to hack a private key can be well used to mine bitcoin- you still stand a chance to find a block.\nForget about hacking addresses.....\n", "author": "7788bitcoin Legendary Offline Activity: 952 Merit: 1000 Presale Starting May 1st "}], "date": "2016-02-01 13:34:49"}, {"content": "Do you guys already try the new Blockchain.info UI that has some new features?\n", "views": 885, "author": "Jeremycoin Legendary Offline Activity: 924 Merit: 1003 𝓗𝓞𝓓𝓛 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNew Blockchain.info UI\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-02-02 01:34:51", "content": "Not yet since to do so, we have to upgrade to the beta version in which limits the functions users could do with the current version as opposed to the beta version and base on replies users got from supports, by doing so, you can't go back if something goes wrong (which have already for some) and you could check some of the comments in the following thread:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1344049.0\n", "author": "SFR10 Legendary Offline Activity: 1204 Merit: 1135 SFR DESIGNS - http://bit.ly/2ClWYOh "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 03:32:05", "content": "im afraid so is it  in beta? i havent tried it, got to read reviews and comments first.\n", "author": "bitraine Sr. Member Offline Activity: 349 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 05:57:41", "content": "Their code have been so buggy in the past, I would much rather wait until all the holes are wrinkled out.

The original block in the blockchain was encoded with a bleak snapshot of the failing financial system, a small quote from the UK Times newspaper:  Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\nIt was banks, central control and corrupt government policy, that the fledgling cryptocurrency was hoping to replace. While it has not yet overthrown the financial institutions of old, nearly 7 years on its still closer to doing so than many people had imagined.\nLike all groundbreaking technologies there were technical teething problems, naysayers and outright battles. Some governments tried to outlaw its use (and some have succeeded). The negative PR stemming from the currencys ties to the illegal dark net markets may have scared some people off. And the early adopters were well and truly screwed over when they stored their digital funds in the Mt. Gox exchange, because hundreds of millions of dollars worth went missing.\nYet here were are, closing in on 2016 and bitcoin is alive and well. In fact its doing better than ever and our new infographic demonstrates that the only way is up, in terms of value and usage.\nIndeed the dollar price of BTC has been steadily rising since the start of the year, regaining ground after its first major crash. In just the past 3 months it has doubled its value by a $200 increase and theres no sign of that slowing down as 2016 emerges.\nAs for the actual trading volume at the exchanges and the overall growth of the exchanges themselves  well both are skyrocketing. From October 2014 to October 2015, OK Coin from Singapore has grown 847%, and even the more western-centric BitStamp has doubled within the year. The market is managing to move $289 million worth of BTC on a daily basis, more than Western Union ($216m) and closing in on PayPal ($397m).\nMeanwhile online and offline merchants are increasingly adding bitcoin as a payment method, supported by bitcoin payment service providers such as Coinify, Europes leader in processing wide range of digital currency payments. Not just to keep customers happy but because it actually costs them less to process. A negligible 1% is charged for BitPay premium members compared to the major credit card networks, which range between 2% and 6%. This has contributed to the jump from 65,000 merchants accepting BTC to 100,000 plus. While we can imagine some scenarios where it isnt beneficial to the customer, retailers like TigerDirect are proud to reveal that bitcoin prevents fraudulent chargebacks which are very common with customers using credit cards.\nIn short all you really need to know is that giants like Microsoft, Expedia and Time Inc. have embraced BTC and many others are following suit. August 2015 saw BitPays most successful month, recording 70,000 transactions.\nIn turn, as this demand has increased so has the venture capital funding the user-friendly apps, bitcoin ATMs, exchanges, and other technology. In 2012 only $2 million was pumped in to the industry. So far in 2015 this has reached $469 million!\nPerhaps the last remaining concern for the bitcoin revolution is overcoming volatility, the freak fluctuations in value. Thankfully the facts dont lie. As the market has grown the impact of panic and large volume trading has lessened. From 2011 to 2015 the line is quite simply going down. For regular traders who exploit volatility this might not be good, but for those who want a simple electronic currency that is out of the reach of the old monetary guard, then were on the revolutionary track that Satoshi Nakamoto laid down.\n", "author": "russian_pete Member Offline Activity: 66 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 03:19:32", "content": "bitcoin is increasing as average per day, there no dump ever,\nall those fluctuation are there for accumulation only\nif you count since when bitcoin was born, we are actually always increasing, even in 2014 yes...\nThe bolded part of your quote above is what most people on this forum, or in the larger bitcoin community in general, fail to appreciate.
