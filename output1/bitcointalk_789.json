This renders key loggers useless as there is no keyboard action to record.\nWe are all about advancements in crypto and if the bitcoin community are interested. I will have my lead dev implement FibreLock in the Bitcoin-QT wallet.\nRegards\nKilla\nIntroducing FibreLock\nAn innovative security feature that has not been seen in Crypto Land before.  The idea behind FibreLock was to remove the keyboard from the password entry process thus rendering key loggers and other malware useless against the FibreWallet !!! FibreLock uses an android style pattern based locking system, there is no keyboard subsystem being used that malware could monitor !!! All inputs will come from your mouse.\nYour pattern will become your password. If your wallet is already encrypted, use the change password feature to swap over to the new pattern input.\nSelect Change Password &gt; Enter your existing password &gt; Enter your new pattern and confirm.\n", "views": 1499, "author": "killakem Sr. Member Offline Activity: 378 Merit: 250 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndroid Style Lock Screen for Bitcoin Wallet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-09-24 10:37:32", "content": "Btw you should have put the original link of coin itself lol but i found it.

At the moment its in the revision 1 stage, but i do appreciate other peoples ideas on how to improve things.\nCurrently it doesn't work using HEX, but uses different methods.\nThe main intentions for creating this are these...\n1) Make the wallet unlock and encrypt security features controllable by a different input mechanism that isn't traditionally monitored by malware key-loggers.\n2) Take away visual cues, such as numbers &amp; letters, which can be interpreted and predicted by other people or computers,\n3) Make the input method based on patterns. Patterns are universally understood and easily remembered by the majority of users. Arguably this gives extra security than just using words / pin codes as people might write them down on a piece of paper. Not saying people won't draw the patterns to remember, but they are less likely to do so and other people finding that pattern on a piece of paper would probably not know what it's for!\nNow going back to your HEX based idea, based on these 3 principles, if the users needed to remember overall a 17 digit input code they would have to remember a 17 point pattern! Now i know personally i could not remember that, especially if had not used the wallet for a couple of weeks!\nEqually if we were to use basic numbers &amp; letters that correlate to the buttons, then that could easily be assumed and retried / replayed by someone else.\nSo it's about trying to find a good balance of creating extra layers of security without compromising the usability of the system.\nJust like any other password or pin code if you forget the pattern, then simply put you will loose access to the wallet and your coins, there is no back door or any difference with the encryption mechanism in the wallet, it's just how the data gets from the users brain into that encryption mechanism that now has now changed, and as each button doesn't correlate to a simple number or letter within the code, the resulting data entering into the encryption mechanism is just as random as a pet cat sitting on the keyboard\n", "author": "bobby6killers Full Member Offline Activity: 138 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 16:06:04", "content": "Thanks Bobby!!\n", "author": "killakem Sr. Member Offline Activity: 378 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 16:20:45", "content": "I am interested I want to use it\n", "author": "adam48 Full Member Offline Activity: 230 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 16:31:51", "content": "So it's about trying to find a good balance of creating extra layers of security without compromising the usability of the system.\nto clarify i didnt mean the user would see any letters and numbers and i quite agree that patterns are more secure.. but..\n.. but,,\nas your image shows a text box with ************ the circles on the keypad must represent some form of alpha-numeric sequence (on YOUR CODING SIDE - not the customers visual side)\nall i meant was that on your coding side if you had a way to convert a customers simple swishes of a phone screen pattern, into an entropy of much larger than the 12 ************ that you use for your encryption method. that would strengthen it.\nthere are many way's to do it.\neven if the customer has to swish their finger across the screen 6 times for one pattern and then another 6. and then YOUR CODE does some nice fancy stuff with those 2 patterns to get atleast 25 entropy. then that would be great.\nbecause a 12 entropy. if hex can be brute forced VERY quickly\nbecause a 12 entropy. if alphanumberic can be brute forced moderately quickly\nbecause a 12 entropy. if alphanumberic+ symbols can be brute forced reasonably quickly\nbut but having entropy of ATLEAST 25 digits, even if a customer only needs to swish 6-12 times atleast makes brute forcing a wallet file using a brute force script harder to achieve.\ni would say that the user interface has many merits. you just need to increase the entropy using some nice maths functions bhind the scenes without causing the user too much inconvenience.\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 16:40:20", "content": "nice one\nonly think i doubt how we will able to use this daemon ?\nwhen running it on a remote server\n", "author": "Supercrypt Legendary Offline Activity: 1302 Merit: 1014 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 19:10:39", "content": "nice one\nonly think i doubt how we will able to use this daemon ?\nwhen running it on a remote server\nUnfortunately not as it relies on mouse or touch input\n", "author": "bobby6killers Full Member Offline Activity: 138 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 19:16:20", "content": "I am interested I want to use it\nCool, come over and try it out\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=737771\n", "author": "bobby6killers Full Member Offline Activity: 138 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 20:23:21", "content": "Thanks franky1, for your suggestions.

Oh and Frank Abagnale needs to crawl out of the rock he is living under.  If you read his statement Frank Abagnale does not actually prove bitcoin is a scam but rather points the accusations to the hackers.\nI think when Frank Abagnale said \"bitcoin\" was the largest scam it was just a way for Frank Abagnale to get negative attention to Bitcoin.  Much like I have done for him in this post\nBecause in Frank Abagnales whole statement there was nothing actually scammish about bitcoin itself but the attention was actually brought to hackers themselves. Bitcoin is not affiliated with the hackers, (that would be counterproductive) the developers are not the ones stealing the coins. Most of the time its not hackers at all just plain outright thieves. And if Frank Abagnale honestly thinks places like JP Morgan, Barclays, Chase, Bank of America, Visa, Master Card and other financial institutions are not thieves it just shows how stupid he is. If Frank Abagnale knew what his bank actually did with his money and why it takes 3 to 7 days to process a transfer in his bank account he may be looking at BTC a little differently. But clearly Frank Abagnale cant see a con if it slapped him right in the face.  I want to say MAYBE even Frank Abagnale was one of the idiots that lost his ass on the MTGOX situation. So now peoplelike Frank Abagnale can see why uyou dont place you money in other peoples hands.\n", "author": "cyberpinoy Hero Member Online Activity: 826 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 03:41:33", "content": "I remember max keiser before adopting pro bitcoin rhetoric saying that the world would be flooded with fake digital currencies.\nWell,\nthat happened.\nThere are 487 known altcoins. Anybody want to buy a Bytecoin, or a Darkcoin, or a Joincoin?\nNone of these altcoins are \"fake\", I would generally consider them to be a scam, but certainly not fake. I would say that the creators of the altcoins are generally trying to take advantage of the \"hype\" that crypto currencies have and wish to profit. In theory one of the altcoins could overtake bitcoin in terms of popularity, use or market cap (although I would doubt it)\n99% of them are fake.  Fake in the sense of being scams or reskins of Bitcoin with a few trivial improvements and yet these coins are sucking in huge amounts of $capital (no idea how or why).\nI think our definition of \"fake\" is different. I agree with you that most (all) altcoins do not add anything of value that bitcoin does not provide nor do they have any real value in the long run nor will succeed.\nI argue they are \"real\" because they really do keep \"track\" of your money the same way that bitcoin does. If you had 2,000 LTC then you could send that 2,000 LTC to another address and would be sure that your money would get there safely. You would likely lose money long term by holding LTC (the same argument applies for every other alt coin) but this is due to the value decreasing and not with the coin being \"fake\"\nEDIT: I find it hard to believe that I am actually on the pro alt coin side of a discussion\n", "author": "zorke Full Member Offline Activity: 238 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 04:12:44", "content": "Frank Abagnale is scam artist, one of the best, that's a fact.

I suspect that you meant the price of the toy will go up. That is not necessarily the case.\nBecause we are living in a consumer society with disposable items, that \"toy\" you want to buy may only have a life-time measured in months that it is actually available for sale. This is particularly true for electronics where new items are quickly replaced by newer items. Other toys such a water guns are considered \"seasonal\": meaning you can only buy them during certain portions of the year (the summer in the case of water guns).\nElectronics are a weird one: because of rapid innovation, the price of a specific item actually goes down over time. not up.

For one thing, government leaders realize that digital currency would hold the same value globally.\nWith all due respect, this is total nonsense. There is no \"worldwide monetary crisis\". Do you even understand what this term means?\nThere is a worldwide\neconomic\ncrisis, which is something completely different. It is caused by the excess of debt world-wide. A currency with a relatively stable value and the ability to extinguish debt, like gold, would solve this problem in the long term, albeit by causing a very deep and sharp (short-lived) crisis (more like a collapse) in the short term. However, this is not the kind of \"solution\" any government would tolerate, let alone desire. Which is why the current status-quo will continue until the crisis becomes so acute that the governments become unable to function.\nAgain, the governments do not want a currency that keeps the same value globally. They want a currency that makes it easier for them to have more of it (with which to buy votes) - either via direct expropriation from the productive population or by indirect confiscation via inflation, since governments do not produce anything.\nThe danger here is that world leaders can decide to come up with new digital currency of their own and do away with bitcoins and others-i hope not.\nThis, however, is correct. The governments do desire a universal electronic currency. If they could, they would eliminate the use of cash by law - only electronic transactions would be permitted. (The free use of large amounts of cash is already severely limited by law in most countries.) Such an electronic currency would solve (from the point of view of the governments) two major \"problems\" - tax evasion (you won't be able to conduct any business transaction in a way that cannot be monitored by the government) and bank runs (you won't be able to withdraw your money from the banking system - you'll be able only to transfer it from one bank to another).\nOf course, such an electronic currency would be nothing like Bitcoin, although some ideas might be taken from there. It will be under government control. Either it will be 100% pre-mined (unlikely, because this will put a limit on how much currency can be created - something the governments do not want) or only the government would be allowed to mine it. Oh, and, of course, its use will be mandatory by law - because nobody in their right mind would accept it voluntarily. Whether it will be based on a public ledger - I don't have an opinion on that; it can be argued both ways.\nBut it most definitely will not be Bitcoin; it will be some kind of altcoin. The fundamental idea in Satoshi's paper, a trustless payment method, based on a distributed ledger, can be used by the banks and the government. The distributed ledger can be public but does not have to be (it is enough for it to be available to the \"monetary authorities\" - i.e., banks and government). The currency can be 100% pre-mined, or some rules can be implemented that define its unlimited increase.\nIf this happens - and I admit that there is a serious danger of it happening - the world will become an even less free place than it is now.\n", "author": "Vessko Full Member Offline Activity: 139 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-22 23:37:29", "content": "If a world leader made its own cryptocurrency, there would be a significant amount of public adoption.

You need to get people \"hooked\" on your content, wanting more (the more would be the site behind the qr code)\nthis is purely informational at this point to get PEOPLE\" to ask the question so what is a qr code ... it just so happens that this qr code lead to bitcoin.com lol they are not being blind they are simply being blindsided into learning there little brains just a bit more today\nlike hey I wanted to know what a qr code was now that i downloaded the app Im going to see what that qr code actually says yey ... don't be so skeptical its a good idea and i will post them with a phone number if i must. I have lots of free time ... not exactly proud of that fact either but might as well make the most of it.\nI don't think a lot of people randomly go around scanning random qr codes. I think that most people know what a qr code code is, as they have been around for several years now and are pretty mainstream.\nI personally do not usually use them unless I have to, and I am certainly not interested in what is \"behind\" any qr code that stands alone or that is only accompanied with a logo\nif you are going to say its a dumb idea than do that but know there really isn't anything bad about this idea especially when you personally put in 0 effort (maybe constructive criticism counts) I'm just doing my best to enlighten those who do not use the internet every day of there lives\nWhat you need to do is give people some reason to scan the qr code. You need to have some kind of content to get them \"hooked\", one thing you could do is to have some kind of slogan something along the lines of \"tired of paying $10 to send money home, there is a way to send money nearly free\" or something else that highlights a feature of bitcoin that your audience will be interested in\nI have mars coins to give as promotional tokens of graditude but that comes with a lengthy explanation ( 100 free mars coins) scan here and open your wallet today...(open a wallet???)

You should have meaningful content displayed in a place that a lot of people will see.

At the moment its in the revision 1 stage, but i do appreciate other peoples ideas on how to improve things.\nCurrently it doesn't work using HEX, but uses different methods.\nThe main intentions for creating this are these...\n1) Make the wallet unlock and encrypt security features controllable by a different input mechanism that isn't traditionally monitored by malware key-loggers.\n2) Take away visual cues, such as numbers &amp; letters, which can be interpreted and predicted by other people or computers,\n3) Make the input method based on patterns. Patterns are universally understood and easily remembered by the majority of users. Arguably this gives extra security than just using words / pin codes as people might write them down on a piece of paper. Not saying people won't draw the patterns to remember, but they are less likely to do so and other people finding that pattern on a piece of paper would probably not know what it's for!\nNow going back to your HEX based idea, based on these 3 principles, if the users needed to remember overall a 17 digit input code they would have to remember a 17 point pattern! Now i know personally i could not remember that, especially if had not used the wallet for a couple of weeks!\nEqually if we were to use basic numbers &amp; letters that correlate to the buttons, then that could easily be assumed and retried / replayed by someone else.\nSo it's about trying to find a good balance of creating extra layers of security without compromising the usability of the system.\nJust like any other password or pin code if you forget the pattern, then simply put you will loose access to the wallet and your coins, there is no back door or any difference with the encryption mechanism in the wallet, it's just how the data gets from the users brain into that encryption mechanism that now has now changed, and as each button doesn't correlate to a simple number or letter within the code, the resulting data entering into the encryption mechanism is just as random as a pet cat sitting on the keyboard\n", "author": "bobby6killers Full Member Offline Activity: 138 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 16:06:04", "content": "Thanks Bobby!!\n", "author": "killakem Sr. Member Offline Activity: 378 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 16:20:45", "content": "I am interested I want to use it\n", "author": "adam48 Full Member Offline Activity: 230 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 16:31:51", "content": "So it's about trying to find a good balance of creating extra layers of security without compromising the usability of the system.\nto clarify i didnt mean the user would see any letters and numbers and i quite agree that patterns are more secure.. but..\n.. but,,\nas your image shows a text box with ************ the circles on the keypad must represent some form of alpha-numeric sequence (on YOUR CODING SIDE - not the customers visual side)\nall i meant was that on your coding side if you had a way to convert a customers simple swishes of a phone screen pattern, into an entropy of much larger than the 12 ************ that you use for your encryption method. that would strengthen it.\nthere are many way's to do it.\neven if the customer has to swish their finger across the screen 6 times for one pattern and then another 6. and then YOUR CODE does some nice fancy stuff with those 2 patterns to get atleast 25 entropy. then that would be great.\nbecause a 12 entropy. if hex can be brute forced VERY quickly\nbecause a 12 entropy. if alphanumberic can be brute forced moderately quickly\nbecause a 12 entropy. if alphanumberic+ symbols can be brute forced reasonably quickly\nbut but having entropy of ATLEAST 25 digits, even if a customer only needs to swish 6-12 times atleast makes brute forcing a wallet file using a brute force script harder to achieve.\ni would say that the user interface has many merits. you just need to increase the entropy using some nice maths functions bhind the scenes without causing the user too much inconvenience.\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 16:40:20", "content": "nice one\nonly think i doubt how we will able to use this daemon ?\nwhen running it on a remote server\n", "author": "Supercrypt Legendary Offline Activity: 1302 Merit: 1014 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 19:10:39", "content": "nice one\nonly think i doubt how we will able to use this daemon ?\nwhen running it on a remote server\nUnfortunately not as it relies on mouse or touch input\n", "author": "bobby6killers Full Member Offline Activity: 138 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 19:16:20", "content": "I am interested I want to use it\nCool, come over and try it out\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=737771\n", "author": "bobby6killers Full Member Offline Activity: 138 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 20:23:21", "content": "Thanks franky1, for your suggestions.

Frank Abagnale has the problem of lack of brains and lack of work ethics. Frank Abagnale is one of those rich fancy asses who expects inferior people to do the work for him. Frank Abagnale did not do any research and from what I can see Frank Abagnale posted (or stated) his assumptions upon biitcoin based on what it was 4.9 years ago. Frank Abagnale just needs to do a little more investigating, grow a brain, and get a little work ethics. Oh and Frank Abagnale needs to crawl out of the rock he is living under.  If you read his statement Frank Abagnale does not actually prove bitcoin is a scam but rather points the accusations to the hackers.\nI think when Frank Abagnale said \"bitcoin\" was the largest scam it was just a way for Frank Abagnale to get negative attention to Bitcoin.  Much like I have done for him in this post\nBecause in Frank Abagnales whole statement there was nothing actually scammish about bitcoin itself but the attention was actually brought to hackers themselves. Bitcoin is not affiliated with the hackers, (that would be counterproductive) the developers are not the ones stealing the coins. Most of the time its not hackers at all just plain outright thieves. And if Frank Abagnale honestly thinks places like JP Morgan, Barclays, Chase, Bank of America, Visa, Master Card and other financial institutions are not thieves it just shows how stupid he is. If Frank Abagnale knew what his bank actually did with his money and why it takes 3 to 7 days to process a transfer in his bank account he may be looking at BTC a little differently. But clearly Frank Abagnale cant see a con if it slapped him right in the face.  I want to say MAYBE even Frank Abagnale was one of the idiots that lost his ass on the MTGOX situation.

I agree with you that most (all) altcoins do not add anything of value that bitcoin does not provide nor do they have any real value in the long run nor will succeed.\nI argue they are \"real\" because they really do keep \"track\" of your money the same way that bitcoin does. If you had 2,000 LTC then you could send that 2,000 LTC to another address and would be sure that your money would get there safely. You would likely lose money long term by holding LTC (the same argument applies for every other alt coin) but this is due to the value decreasing and not with the coin being \"fake\"\nEDIT: I find it hard to believe that I am actually on the pro alt coin side of a discussion\n", "author": "zorke Full Member Offline Activity: 238 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-24 04:12:44", "content": "Frank Abagnale is scam artist, one of the best, that's a fact.

Children can learn martial arts as early as 3 to 4 years old.\n2. Children can learn to field strip and clean, tap, rack and fire a gun as early as 5 to 6 years old.\n3. Infants can learn to swim even below 12 months old. (Well, they can learn to float and not drown.)\n4. They can learn as many languages as you can teach them below 6.\nI think these ages are really the exception to the rule. Most kids to do learn how to do these things this young. I would also think that these ages are not an appropriate age to learn these kind of things as they should be \"being a kid\" when they are 5 or 6.\nThe brain develops most in the early years of childhood\nThat's when the mind records information about its environment and surroundings the most and when it processes information\nIf that critical period is missed things become much more difficult to learn once they are older.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_period#First_language_acquisition\nBut with Bitcoin 4 to 7 seems fine to me.\nI would generally not teach a 7 year old about money (or if I were to do so I would stick to the very basics), and bitcoin is more advanced then traditional money. Therefore I would not attempt to teach a child about bitcoin. I think that most children should be able to first grasp the concept of getting an allowance and saving a portion of that money in order to buy something they want (like a large purchase) to show them the rewards of saving over time.

For one thing, government leaders realize that digital currency would hold the same value globally.\nWith all due respect, this is total nonsense. There is no \"worldwide monetary crisis\". Do you even understand what this term means?\nThere is a worldwide\neconomic\ncrisis, which is something completely different. It is caused by the excess of debt world-wide. A currency with a relatively stable value and the ability to extinguish debt, like gold, would solve this problem in the long term, albeit by causing a very deep and sharp (short-lived) crisis (more like a collapse) in the short term. However, this is not the kind of \"solution\" any government would tolerate, let alone desire. Which is why the current status-quo will continue until the crisis becomes so acute that the governments become unable to function.\nAgain, the governments do not want a currency that keeps the same value globally. They want a currency that makes it easier for them to have more of it (with which to buy votes) - either via direct expropriation from the productive population or by indirect confiscation via inflation, since governments do not produce anything.\nThe danger here is that world leaders can decide to come up with new digital currency of their own and do away with bitcoins and others-i hope not.\nThis, however, is correct. The governments do desire a universal electronic currency. If they could, they would eliminate the use of cash by law - only electronic transactions would be permitted. (The free use of large amounts of cash is already severely limited by law in most countries.) Such an electronic currency would solve (from the point of view of the governments) two major \"problems\" - tax evasion (you won't be able to conduct any business transaction in a way that cannot be monitored by the government) and bank runs (you won't be able to withdraw your money from the banking system - you'll be able only to transfer it from one bank to another).\nOf course, such an electronic currency would be nothing like Bitcoin, although some ideas might be taken from there. It will be under government control. Either it will be 100% pre-mined (unlikely, because this will put a limit on how much currency can be created - something the governments do not want) or only the government would be allowed to mine it. Oh, and, of course, its use will be mandatory by law - because nobody in their right mind would accept it voluntarily. Whether it will be based on a public ledger - I don't have an opinion on that; it can be argued both ways.\nBut it most definitely will not be Bitcoin; it will be some kind of altcoin. The fundamental idea in Satoshi's paper, a trustless payment method, based on a distributed ledger, can be used by the banks and the government. The distributed ledger can be public but does not have to be (it is enough for it to be available to the \"monetary authorities\" - i.e., banks and government). The currency can be 100% pre-mined, or some rules can be implemented that define its unlimited increase.\nIf this happens - and I admit that there is a serious danger of it happening - the world will become an even less free place than it is now.\n", "author": "Vessko Full Member Offline Activity: 139 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-09-22 23:37:29", "content": "If a world leader made its own cryptocurrency, there would be a significant amount of public adoption.
