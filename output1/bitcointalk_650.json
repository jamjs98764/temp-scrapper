Suppose you don't trust any form of banking, though. In that case you can take cash, metals, trades, and Bitcoin. Unless, of course, you use something like Coinbase. Then you have to trust them. Bitcoin is, literally, meant to be a digital analog to cash. It's better than cash in that it's theoretically impossible to counterfeit it, something which can't be said about any tangible form of value transfer, such as a check or bank note.\nAnyway, my point is that the protocol was built specifically to not need middlemen. This article is not meant to knock those who have incorporated Coinbase and Bitpay into their business models, but it is meant to remind the many small business owners out there of exactly how little you need such leech-tastic institutions. Honestly, what the hell? Coinbase facilitates payments for Bitcoin  what does that even mean? Oh, you have a smooth API that makes it easy to accept payments. Awesome. Unless I'm doing more than 10 transactions in Bitcoin per day, I can't see a need for anything more than a secure wallet.\nAnd with my new business, and the one I'm going to fund via this business, I won't be using any such service. Even if every customer was to choose the Bitcoin option, there's no checkout with my kind of work. It's either cash up front or cash on delivery  invoice. I can generate a separate address for each invoice, same as Coinbase does, quite easily.\nI've thought about this in a number of ways. As a consumer, I've always gone with Bitpay when it was an option, unless a direct option were available. It always bothered me that one of my favorite online stores, Overstock.com, which I've been shopping at sans Bitcoin since 2010, chose Coinbase. I wish they'd gone the route of offering both Bitpay and Coinbase. Bitpay works better, and I'd rather support them.\nBut now that I've finally decided to knuckle down and start the business of my dreams, I have no intention of utilizing the services of anymore payment service providers than I have to. Paypal is fine by me for processing credit cards. It's near-ubiquitous. As regards Bitcoin, I've got a wallet for that. And it's not an SPV wallet, as Gavin Bell Andresen would want you to believe. It's a full-fledged desktop wallet called Armory.\nI grew up in the last days of an era when money wasn't easy. You took your paycheck to the bank, desposited it, and they stamped a little book that was your own personal record of transactions. Though it never happened, that record was my only insurance against fraud via the bank. The first bank I dealt with was called Citizens-Union Savings Bank in Fall River, MA.\nYour money wasn't easy to earn, was harder to spend, and it would still take a lifetime to understand all the goings-on of the Federal Reserve.\nBitcoin has always made a lot more sense to me -- particularly the part about there only being an absolutely limited amount of it. I always think of these people's money when I think about value. Recent events have me losing faith in the project by degrees, but not in cryptocurrency as a whole. I attribute much of the strife in the community to competing special interests, idealistic despotism, ignorance, hyperbole, and, of course, investors  that is, people who's sole interest in Bitcoin is using it to make more fiat cash with which to pollute some other fresh new idea.\nWoah, woah, but I digress. Point is, even when I get to the next level of my business plans, which is taking much of the proceeds from this one and funding it (nope, no VC money, thanks  seriously, you can't see how toxic that shit is?), and I have a product for sale, at that point I'd rather build out my own Bitcoin payment processing module in-house. It's not as hard as it sounds, if you read something like this developer guide.\nBitcoin is open source and open source means a lot more than free code for greedy coast-dwellers to pervert and promote. Open source means open ended, without any true authority except does it work better than the alternatives? Open source, for me, means community  a community of passionate people who will contribute to the things they use regardless of financial incentive. This is not to say that it's not great that people are able to make decent livings while working on open code. In fact, I think that's one of the greatest things going on right now. But to quote the Debian Social Contract:\nWe will be guided by the needs of our users and the free software community. We will place their interests first in our priorities.\nCoinbase does not put the needs of the Bitcoin community first in its priorities. They have tracked user transactions two and three hops out of their wallet, punishing them for using LocalBitcoins which is, incidentally, a competitor for the \"exchange\" part of the whole thing. Cronyism much? Under no circumstances will I willingly support such practices. I may as well just have Bank of America process my Bitcoin transactions for me.\nThanks for reading.\nP. H.

Honestly, I did not check the website after asking the question. I guess it is still much better than nothing. Hopefully other stores will catch on.\nNo. We can compare Edeka with Walmart. Walmart is the biggest supermarket chain in the United States. And Edeka is the biggest of its type in the Germany and probably the second largest one within the European Union (after Tesco of the United Kingdom). Right now, Edeka is holding a 26% market share in Germany, and it is increasing at a good pace.\nI would disagree though. You have to compare the US to Germany then. The population that Walmart serves is just much larger than the one that Edeka serves in Germany. Besides, Walmart is literally (we could say that) everything compared to Edeka (which has some hypermarkets). I would say that Walmart is a \"hyperhypermarket\".\n", "author": "Lauda Legendary Offline Activity: 1974 Merit: 1585 GUNBOT Licenses up to 70% OFF - 'GrumpyKitty'.

Also, notice that if you put blank space on your name, once you climbed to the leaderboard, you'll see that it will display you as 'An unnamed cell', another biological reference.

I wouldn't say Bitcoin is more organized based off all of the drama with the blocksize but it definitely does has bigger players but does that really make it better? Does having more large companies trying to profit off a coin make it the better coin?\nYes it is true. Having more companies will make it a better coin. Larger companies bitcoin is depends on each people usage, the more usage the more\ncoin and the bigger is the company. I guess that is a lot of question why they are using bitcoin more than other coin.

Even one TENTH might be enough to make it viable for the long term, but iffy.\nRight now I don't know of ANY major merchant that accepts Litecoin - as long as that continues, Litecoin (like ALL of the other altcoins) has no chance of long-term survival, much less turning out to be competition to Bitcoin.\nIt's not that I don't LIKE Litecoin - I paid for several video cards back when GPU mining was viable through mining income from it, and even managed to ROI 2 of my 3 Gridseed blades (the third was at the $1600ish level, I doubt that one will EVER ROI though it's still marginally profitable).\nIt's that Litecoin is .... well, not a joke compared to Bitcoin, but not far away from being one.\nI just don't see the long-term market having much use for more than 1 cryptocurrency unless the competators provide REAL WORLD advantages in different ways to each other. So far, I don't see that out of ANY of the current altcoins - they all seem at best to a destiny of a \"small niche\" alternative.\nFancy \"technological better\" points tend to mean NOTHING to most of the public, which is WHY the better technology but greatly inferior marketing of Betamax LOST the VCR wars to the \"good enough\" VHS.\nThat is also why Windows remains the dominant desktop OS, even though several \"technologically better\" alternatives exist and have existed in the past - Windows is \"good enough\" and VERY VERY well marketed.\nThis is not to say that Bitcoin will REMAIN the 800 pound gorilla - it's got some issues of it's own that are starting to get some serious notice, that will eventually limit it's ABILITY for wider adoption if they are not corrected. The \"number of transactions\" issue has already been getting some active attention (and fights about fixing it), the insane SIZE of the blockchain is a major issue (with some workarounds, but those workarounds have issues themselves), the long time to confirm a transaction (makes it bloody close to USELESS in a non-online retail environment), the eventual elimination of block rewards that will probably kill mining and make confirmations take forever, make me inclined that BitCoin is open to losing out to someone creating a TRUE better answer.\n", "author": "QuintLeo Legendary Offline Activity: 1176 Merit: 1022 "}, {"date": "2015-08-02 20:16:22", "content": "There is a movie called bitcoin\n", "author": "itsjohnny Jr. Member Offline Activity: 48 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-08-02 20:23:39", "content": "wiki leaks now accepting litecoin so score one for them\n", "author": "jonald_fyookball Legendary Offline Activity: 1302 Merit: 1002 Core dev leaves me neg feedback #abuse #political "}, {"date": "2015-08-02 20:40:40", "content": "first of all bitcoin has a lot more users secondly more companies accept it thirdly the price of it is much bigger and can easier grow as more and more people use it\n", "author": "7bestone7 Full Member Offline Activity: 182 Merit: 100 ★YoBit.Net★ 200+ Coins Exchange &amp; Dice "}, {"date": "2015-08-02 20:51:53", "content": "Simple answer bitcoin is more famous than litecoin\nThis is pretty much it.

THAT is the big issue with trying to use any Cryptocoin in a retail store environment - customers do NOT want to wait around for MINUTES to see if they're going to be able to buy something, they often get irritated if it takes more than a few SECONDS on a credit card transaction.\nThis completely contradicts what you're writing below.\nAs soon as you see a transaction, and no funny business is going on (like an existing conflicting transaction in the memory pool, or tons of dust output with zero tx fee), then you're already very,\nvery\nsure it will be confirmed. Maybe in the next block, maybe in 10 blocks from now, but it\nwill\nbe confirmed.\nMAJOR Error. Confirmation time is NOT chargeback limit time.\nCryptocoins do not HAVE a chargeback mechanism at all, which is one reason merchants LIKE cryptocoin payments - they know they HAVE the money once the transaction has been processed at all, it's just a matter of time because there is no way to reverse the transaction no matter what.\nExactly, so why the hell would any merchant ever make a customer await even a single confirmation. This is what I mean with \"Bitcoin payments are instant\":\nnobody\nwill have to wait 10 minutes (or whatever the amount time it takes until the next confirmation). With Bitcoin, you send your payment, and you're done. In a second. Nobody waiting, nobody at risk.\nAnd yes, obviously, there is no such thing as chargebacks with cryptocoins. I mean the concept of a transaction becoming irreversible, or permanent, or set in stone. With Bitcoin, theoretically, a transaction is not 'guaranteed' (although *extremely* unlikely to be nullified) until it's confirmed. With paypal or credit card it can be reversed (and happens quite often) until the chargeback/dispute period expires, and that's typically 3-6 months.\n", "author": "Jace Sr. Member Offline Activity: 287 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-08-07 00:55:02", "content": "That is kind of like asking how is Apple better than iPhone, or how is Nike better than Jordans.\nLitecoin was built off Bitcoin.\nI think it is different bro, you cant compare between apple and iphone, because they are the same, and litecoin bitcoin is not the same, these two different coin\n", "author": "ajun96 Hero Member Offline Activity: 658 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-08-07 01:02:55", "content": "Bitcoin is the standard  when comparing among cryptocurrencies.

You get my point. With credit cards and paypal, there is no such thing as a confirmation. There is a notification of receiving a payment, which is the equivalent of receiving a Bitcoin transaction (nothing confirmed yet). This is a matter of seconds. Then there is a certain period of uncertainty, where you will probably end up receiving the money, but it might also be cancelled or nullified or reversed (no matter what you call it, you end up without the money).

The debate, which eats up /r/Bitcoin, has led to the meta question of Bitcoin governance - a buzzword that sums up the question: What happens when developers and stakeholders don't agree? What's the best process to address this?\nGavin Andresen, who has a unique perspective on the topic as Bitcoin's former lead developer, joined Epicenter Bitcoin for a conversation on just that.\nCheck the interview here :\nhttps://youtu.be/B8l11q9hsJM\nThe podcast took on the meta-meta-question of defining governance and zeroing in on which Bitcoin governance issuesexactlyneed to be addressed. Andresen offered a broad definition. When I say governance, I don't mean government. We're governed by all sorts of things, he said. We're governed by our government, we're governed by the laws of physics, we're governed by social norms. There are all sorts of things that affect our behavior. He used the word process to describe how to reach these decisions.\nAndresen and Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn recently announced Bitcoin XT, a variant of Bitcoin core with a larger blocksize. While the questions of when and how much to grow the blocksize is itself controversial, Bitcoin XT's decision-making process is also controversial. Hearn is to make the final call when the developers disagree.\nSince then, developers that allegedly make up 90 percent of Bitcoin's commits in the last year released an open letter calling for support from the community to work together towards decentralization.\nBitcoin's decision-making process has evolved over time, according to Andresen, If you go back in time, it was simple. It was whatever Satoshi decided. He said that he decentralized that by extending commit accessdevelopers that are authorized make permanent changes to Bitcointo five people. But Bitcoin has grown. Today, it interests many stakeholders, including miners, payment processors, and everyday users.\nAndresen:\nI don't think any of usespecially those five peoplewant to be the high priests of Bitcoin. We need to find a new way of governinga new way of coming to decisions and have everyone be happy with the process and the decisions that are reached.\nFull article :\nhttp://cointelegraph.com/news/115235/gavin-andresen-nobody-wants-to-be-the-high-priest-of-bitcoin\n", "views": 294, "author": "OmegaStarScream Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1414 Merit: 1101 Hire BOUNTYPORTALS&gt;Bounty management goo.gl/XKv9TK ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGavin Andresen: Nobody Wants to be the High Priest of Bitcoin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-09-06 16:55:12", "content": "I don't understand who would like to see centralized nodes as a solution.

Suppose you don't trust any form of banking, though. In that case you can take cash, metals, trades, and Bitcoin. Unless, of course, you use something like Coinbase. Then you have to trust them. Bitcoin is, literally, meant to be a digital analog to cash. It's better than cash in that it's theoretically impossible to counterfeit it, something which can't be said about any tangible form of value transfer, such as a check or bank note.\nAnyway, my point is that the protocol was built specifically to not need middlemen. This article is not meant to knock those who have incorporated Coinbase and Bitpay into their business models, but it is meant to remind the many small business owners out there of exactly how little you need such leech-tastic institutions. Honestly, what the hell? Coinbase facilitates payments for Bitcoin  what does that even mean? Oh, you have a smooth API that makes it easy to accept payments. Awesome. Unless I'm doing more than 10 transactions in Bitcoin per day, I can't see a need for anything more than a secure wallet.\nAnd with my new business, and the one I'm going to fund via this business, I won't be using any such service. Even if every customer was to choose the Bitcoin option, there's no checkout with my kind of work. It's either cash up front or cash on delivery  invoice. I can generate a separate address for each invoice, same as Coinbase does, quite easily.\nI've thought about this in a number of ways. As a consumer, I've always gone with Bitpay when it was an option, unless a direct option were available. It always bothered me that one of my favorite online stores, Overstock.com, which I've been shopping at sans Bitcoin since 2010, chose Coinbase. I wish they'd gone the route of offering both Bitpay and Coinbase. Bitpay works better, and I'd rather support them.\nBut now that I've finally decided to knuckle down and start the business of my dreams, I have no intention of utilizing the services of anymore payment service providers than I have to. Paypal is fine by me for processing credit cards. It's near-ubiquitous. As regards Bitcoin, I've got a wallet for that. And it's not an SPV wallet, as Gavin Bell Andresen would want you to believe. It's a full-fledged desktop wallet called Armory.\nI grew up in the last days of an era when money wasn't easy. You took your paycheck to the bank, desposited it, and they stamped a little book that was your own personal record of transactions. Though it never happened, that record was my only insurance against fraud via the bank. The first bank I dealt with was called Citizens-Union Savings Bank in Fall River, MA.\nYour money wasn't easy to earn, was harder to spend, and it would still take a lifetime to understand all the goings-on of the Federal Reserve.\nBitcoin has always made a lot more sense to me -- particularly the part about there only being an absolutely limited amount of it. I always think of these people's money when I think about value. Recent events have me losing faith in the project by degrees, but not in cryptocurrency as a whole. I attribute much of the strife in the community to competing special interests, idealistic despotism, ignorance, hyperbole, and, of course, investors  that is, people who's sole interest in Bitcoin is using it to make more fiat cash with which to pollute some other fresh new idea.\nWoah, woah, but I digress. Point is, even when I get to the next level of my business plans, which is taking much of the proceeds from this one and funding it (nope, no VC money, thanks  seriously, you can't see how toxic that shit is?), and I have a product for sale, at that point I'd rather build out my own Bitcoin payment processing module in-house. It's not as hard as it sounds, if you read something like this developer guide.\nBitcoin is open source and open source means a lot more than free code for greedy coast-dwellers to pervert and promote. Open source means open ended, without any true authority except does it work better than the alternatives? Open source, for me, means community  a community of passionate people who will contribute to the things they use regardless of financial incentive. This is not to say that it's not great that people are able to make decent livings while working on open code. In fact, I think that's one of the greatest things going on right now. But to quote the Debian Social Contract:\nWe will be guided by the needs of our users and the free software community. We will place their interests first in our priorities.\nCoinbase does not put the needs of the Bitcoin community first in its priorities. They have tracked user transactions two and three hops out of their wallet, punishing them for using LocalBitcoins which is, incidentally, a competitor for the \"exchange\" part of the whole thing. Cronyism much? Under no circumstances will I willingly support such practices. I may as well just have Bank of America process my Bitcoin transactions for me.\nThanks for reading.\nP. H.

It's a reference to the Agar plate (it's a bacteria growth medium)...

It's not dumb in anyway because there are some references to the name, it's just that people tend to only notice the circles alone and not the name that it stands for. Also, notice that if you put blank space on your name, once you climbed to the leaderboard, you'll see that it will display you as 'An unnamed cell', another biological reference. So all in all, the field in which the cells are moving to is the Agar plate and the players that are in it are the bacteria; the small circles you begin to eat are the 'nutrients' that are already present in the Agar dish.\nNice one\nI think this actually works...

Even one TENTH might be enough to make it viable for the long term, but iffy.\nRight now I don't know of ANY major merchant that accepts Litecoin - as long as that continues, Litecoin (like ALL of the other altcoins) has no chance of long-term survival, much less turning out to be competition to Bitcoin.\nIt's not that I don't LIKE Litecoin - I paid for several video cards back when GPU mining was viable through mining income from it, and even managed to ROI 2 of my 3 Gridseed blades (the third was at the $1600ish level, I doubt that one will EVER ROI though it's still marginally profitable).\nIt's that Litecoin is .... well, not a joke compared to Bitcoin, but not far away from being one.\nI just don't see the long-term market having much use for more than 1 cryptocurrency unless the competators provide REAL WORLD advantages in different ways to each other.

Litecoin also enjoys a faster speed of transaction compared to bitcoin, as the former takes only 2.5 minutes while the latter needs 9 minutes. But at the end of the day Bitcoin is much better than Litecoin since the number of crowd who use Bitcoin is greater. And cryptocurrencies live only because of the population who used it, if the population drops the currency will drop.

This algorithm incorporates the SHA-256 algorithm, but its calculations are much more serialised than those of SHA-256 in bitcoin.

I had a merchant account for a few years back in the 1990s, I NEVER saw it take hours much less days to recieve my payment for a transaction, unless I couldn't get into the automated system AT ALL, and on automated transactions the norm was SECONDS. Even on the weekends (I did a LOT of sales at computer shows and hamfests) I'd have the money in my account before I got packed up after the show ended and I could get to an ATM to check (hours at MOST, but couldn't tell for sure how long given time between the sale and when I was available TO check).\nThe only way it would take DAYS for a credit card transaction to get the money to the seller is if they ran the transaction manually, then it took the seller days to actually SUBMIT it.\nPaypal has often had merchant money from sales \"on hold\" for MONTHS at a time.

You tell me how that's possible, if the 2nd transaction (which spends output from the 1st) would have required the 1st to be confirmed first.\nIt gets even more confusing when you say \"normally\nmultiple\nconfirmations needed\" - what do you mean \"normally\", as if some transactions require more confirmations than others before they can be spent, or what?

You get my point. With credit cards and paypal, there is no such thing as a confirmation. There is a notification of receiving a payment, which is the equivalent of receiving a Bitcoin transaction (nothing confirmed yet). This is a matter of seconds. Then there is a certain period of uncertainty, where you will probably end up receiving the money, but it might also be cancelled or nullified or reversed (no matter what you call it, you end up without the money).

The debate, which eats up /r/Bitcoin, has led to the meta question of Bitcoin governance - a buzzword that sums up the question: What happens when developers and stakeholders don't agree? What's the best process to address this?\nGavin Andresen, who has a unique perspective on the topic as Bitcoin's former lead developer, joined Epicenter Bitcoin for a conversation on just that.\nCheck the interview here :\nhttps://youtu.be/B8l11q9hsJM\nThe podcast took on the meta-meta-question of defining governance and zeroing in on which Bitcoin governance issuesexactlyneed to be addressed. Andresen offered a broad definition. When I say governance, I don't mean government. We're governed by all sorts of things, he said. We're governed by our government, we're governed by the laws of physics, we're governed by social norms. There are all sorts of things that affect our behavior. He used the word process to describe how to reach these decisions.\nAndresen and Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn recently announced Bitcoin XT, a variant of Bitcoin core with a larger blocksize. While the questions of when and how much to grow the blocksize is itself controversial, Bitcoin XT's decision-making process is also controversial. Hearn is to make the final call when the developers disagree.\nSince then, developers that allegedly make up 90 percent of Bitcoin's commits in the last year released an open letter calling for support from the community to work together towards decentralization.\nBitcoin's decision-making process has evolved over time, according to Andresen, If you go back in time, it was simple. It was whatever Satoshi decided. He said that he decentralized that by extending commit accessdevelopers that are authorized make permanent changes to Bitcointo five people. But Bitcoin has grown. Today, it interests many stakeholders, including miners, payment processors, and everyday users.\nAndresen:\nI don't think any of usespecially those five peoplewant to be the high priests of Bitcoin. We need to find a new way of governinga new way of coming to decisions and have everyone be happy with the process and the decisions that are reached.\nFull article :\nhttp://cointelegraph.com/news/115235/gavin-andresen-nobody-wants-to-be-the-high-priest-of-bitcoin\n", "views": 294, "author": "OmegaStarScream Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1414 Merit: 1101 Hire BOUNTYPORTALS&gt;Bounty management goo.gl/XKv9TK ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGavin Andresen: Nobody Wants to be the High Priest of Bitcoin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-09-06 16:55:12", "content": "I don't understand who would like to see centralized nodes as a solution.
