Your choice if you do or not.\nWhy? I am interested....\nDo you want to know the biggest one? It's more sanitary. Since it it's not physically there you cannot sneeze on it and give it to somebody, moreover it would allow a clerk to basically not handle the money and then handle the food which is currently the worldwide practice, which is unsanitary.\nI have handled such seriously dirty fiat, where the paper has darkened so much, to the point where I am disgusted just by looking at it.\nHow about another one, you always pay the exact amount, no physical coins to dangle in your pocket. The register would display the exact amount you have to pay, you scan with whatever device the future has and you immediately pay the EXACT amount. Sure you could do this with a credit card, but by the time you take it out from your wallet, input it into the machine, type your pin and wait 60 seconds(I assure that is how long it takes for a VISA transaction to get processed over here, increasing the time to wait by all customers).\nConsider this probably rather rare scenario, where kids are MORE LIKELY to choke on coins that are real VS those that are digital.\nThere, Bitcoin prevented possible deaths twice, once from disease, twice from a child choking to death or worse, having to have surgery to remove a coin stuck somewhere in his body. Any surgery no matter how routine can be fatal. Or how about people with HIV and no immune system?\nAnother thing I can think off, is that, when decentralized exchanges appear, they can prove 100% that they hold X amount of bitcoin, and they could be designed in such a way as to not work as a fractional-reserve bank.\n", "author": "Remember remember the 5th of November Legendary Offline Activity: 1736 Merit: 1001 Reverse engineer from time to time "}, {"date": "2015-02-07 03:02:04", "content": "Bitcoin will not take over (meaning it will replace fiat currency).

Sure you could do this with a credit card, but by the time you take it out from your wallet, input it into the machine, type your pin and wait 60 seconds(I assure that is how long it takes for a VISA transaction to get processed over here, increasing the time to wait by all customers).\nConsider this probably rather rare scenario, where kids are MORE LIKELY to choke on coins that are real VS those that are digital.\nThere, Bitcoin prevented possible deaths twice, once from disease, twice from a child choking to death or worse, having to have surgery to remove a coin stuck somewhere in his body.
