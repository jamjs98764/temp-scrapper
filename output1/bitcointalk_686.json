There was no explanation in the interview why this shouldn't be a concern now.\nFurthermore the blckstream thing you bring up is propaganda by the pro-Gavin-shills who try their very best to put everyone who opposes Gavincoin into a bad image.\nJust because some developers are working on offchain solutions doesn't mean they are biased. They are doing exactly the work that needs to be done to keep Bitcoin defensible. It is not a conflict of interests, it is necessary work and real innovation. Just going ahead and bloating the blockchain is no innovation.\nThere are 100 things that can be done to increase max txs without forking the coin without consensus. None of that has been explored.

Would be prefectly fine as long as everyone keeps the full access we have now so you can use the offchain stuff but you don't have to. You can still send your coins around on chain. Where's the problem to have all the dust transactions off chain?\nBitcoin is here to fuck the banks into the ass necessarily not to buy you coffee at starbucks. You can buy your coffee off chain or just pay a little higher fees if you want your coffee on chain. No problem there.\nDecentralisation, consensus and defensibility is more important than max txs.\nI also found the argument compelling by one of the other devs that the problem is not urgent and until it could potentially become an issue there would be some more time left to potentially develop better solutions than just bloating the thing up (which is also no permanent fix).\nSo it's no problem now and until it is maybe better solutions become available.\nRight now it's better to stay on 1MB blocks than to risk blowing the deam thing up because the consensus was harmed.\nPeople need to understand Bitcoin is worthless without consensus and decentralisation aswell as defensibiltiy.\nMax txs are secondary order of importance and not primary.\nI think Gavin operates by asking himself, \"what would Satoshi do?\" Making 20MB blocks is his best guess as to what Bitcoin's creator would have done.\nYeah, and other people ask themselves \"what would mohamet/jesus do?\" before they go and kill people.\nThats no excuse.

But, GMaxwell did not agree. Rumour is that GMaxwell's company blockstream, which has got 21M USD funding, is working on solving the lightning.netwrok problem and imlementation of sidechains. Hence GMaxwell wants 1 MB cap to stay so blockstream can reap the beneit of solving the problem. Due to this disagreement, Gavin said that if the consensus can not be reached at dev level, then it goes to the node level. Hence he asked people to use XT (which is currently almost identical to Bitcoin Core) to show support for him. If 50% of the bitcoin network run XT, then he'llrequest devs again to modify Bitcoin Core so that hard fork does not happen. If they still do not agree, he'll wait for the network to run 90% on XT and then implement the changes on XT. That is when hard fork happens, but with already 90% network running on XT, XT chain will invariably survive. In any case, none of this is going to happen before February 2016. All these things are now at discussion level.\nYou forgot\nanother reason\nfor opposing the biger block size\nBut it is clear at this point that inaction is not an option.  Not doing anything will bring a change too, just not a very good one.\nDint forget.

A valid block header contains a merkle root, which is a hash of all of the transactions contained within the block. If Bitcoin nodes only looked at a portion of the block, then the validation would fail because hashing all of the transactions in that portion would NOT result in the merkle root which then creates a different header.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.\nhow would the node know that all of the other transactions contained in the rest of the block know that they were confirmed?\nNo, they don't.

It is saying that the hard fork to the new block size should occur at a block number so far in the future that everyone has upgraded to a client that will support the new blocks.\n", "author": "achow101 Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1526 Merit: 1600 3F1Y9yquzvY6RWvKbw2n2zeo9V5mvBhADU "}, {"date": "2015-06-04 19:32:23", "content": "-snip-\nWhy do we have to hard fork the blockchain? why not just modify these codes at bitcoin-qt, and every one using bitcoin-qt can recognize the lagger block.\nNot everyone, the old versions would\nnot accept the node as valid\nonly recognize the first 1MB of a given block\n, thus splitting the network into those running old versions and those running new versions. This is what is called a hard fork as your client either\naccepts the changes or not\nread the first 1MB or the whole of the block\n. The number of lines you have to edit does not matter. It also does not matter if you push the hard fork into the future by a certain number of blocks, it only lessens the impact of the change as its more likely for people to update over a long period of time than it is over a short period of time.\nSo : \"every one using new version bitcoin-qt can recognize the lagger block\"\nDo you mean these few lines changes = the whole hard fork thing we are talking about everywhere? i see people talking about two independence blockchains. If we go as my way, there is only one blockchain, old version qt can only recognize the first 1mb of a given lagger block, new qt can recognize 20 MB of it, that's it.\nNo, the old version can not recognize the first 1MB of a block, because you would try to give it a bigger block. It would look at it and say: nope not valid and be done with it. Changing the old version is a patch that makes it no longer an old version.\nWhy the heck people don't agree with this change?:\nCode:\nif blocksize&gt; 1MB then blocksize=1MB\nto\nCode:\nif blocksize&gt; 20MB then blocksize=20MB\nOf cause this is not the final solution since the blocksize would need to be &gt; 10GB in the future,\nbut it makes bitcoin stronger and buy us some time for a better solution,\nisn it?\nThe Green part\nis the reason Gavin Andresen wants the change. Gavin will go for hard fork only if 90% of the network is running on XT.\nThe Red part\nis the reason Gregory Maxwell does not want the change. GMaxwell is proposing the problem to be solved by implementing a very complex thing called lightning.netwrok.\nCan't we just go for the 20MB first, then use the time (years) we bought to properly test Gregory Maxwell 's lightning.netwrok again and again and if the result is all good, then we use it.\nGavin proposed exactly what you are proposing here. But, GMaxwell did not agree. Rumour is that GMaxwell's company blockstream, which has got 21M USD funding, is working on solving the lightning.netwrok problem and imlementation of sidechains. Hence GMaxwell wants 1 MB cap to stay so blockstream can reap the beneit of solving the problem. Due to this disagreement, Gavin said that if the consensus can not be reached at dev level, then it goes to the node level. Hence he asked people to use XT (which is currently almost identical to Bitcoin Core) to show support for him. If 50% of the bitcoin network run XT, then he'llrequest devs again to modify Bitcoin Core so that hard fork does not happen. If they still do not agree, he'll wait for the network to run 90% on XT and then implement the changes on XT. That is when hard fork happens, but with already 90% network running on XT, XT chain will invariably survive. In any case, none of this is going to happen before February 2016. All these things are now at discussion level.\nYou forgot\nanother reason\nfor opposing the biger block size\nBut it is clear at this point that inaction is not an option.  Not doing anything will bring a change too, just not a very good one.\nDint forget. But dint mention, because I have respect for GMaxwell and believe it is not as blunt as it has been portrayed.

While I agree that we should raise the block size limit and that a solution must be found, I don't think that we should only do what Satoshi said 5 five years ago when other solutions did not exist, and that what he said may no longer be applicable.\n", "author": "achow101 Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1526 Merit: 1600 3F1Y9yquzvY6RWvKbw2n2zeo9V5mvBhADU "}, {"date": "2015-06-04 21:19:01", "content": "-snip-\nWhy do we have to hard fork the blockchain? why not just modify these codes at bitcoin-qt, and every one using bitcoin-qt can recognize the lagger block.\nNot everyone, the old versions would\nnot accept the node as valid\nonly recognize the first 1MB of a given block\n, thus splitting the network into those running old versions and those running new versions.

But, GMaxwell did not agree. Rumour is that GMaxwell's company blockstream, which has got 21M USD funding, is working on solving the lightning.netwrok problem and imlementation of sidechains. Hence GMaxwell wants 1 MB cap to stay so blockstream can reap the beneit of solving the problem. Due to this disagreement, Gavin said that if the consensus can not be reached at dev level, then it goes to the node level. Hence he asked people to use XT (which is currently almost identical to Bitcoin Core) to show support for him. If 50% of the bitcoin network run XT, then he'llrequest devs again to modify Bitcoin Core so that hard fork does not happen. If they still do not agree, he'll wait for the network to run 90% on XT and then implement the changes on XT. That is when hard fork happens, but with already 90% network running on XT, XT chain will invariably survive. In any case, none of this is going to happen before February 2016.

A valid block header contains a merkle root, which is a hash of all of the transactions contained within the block.

This is what is called a hard fork as your client either\naccepts the changes or not\nread the first 1MB or the whole of the block\n. The number of lines you have to edit does not matter. It also does not matter if you push the hard fork into the future by a certain number of blocks, it only lessens the impact of the change as its more likely for people to update over a long period of time than it is over a short period of time.\nSo : \"every one using new version bitcoin-qt can recognize the lagger block\"\nDo you mean these few lines changes = the whole hard fork thing we are talking about everywhere? i see people talking about two independence blockchains. If we go as my way, there is only one blockchain, old version qt can only recognize the first 1mb of a given lagger block, new qt can recognize 20 MB of it, that's it.\nNo, the old version can not recognize the first 1MB of a block, because you would try to give it a bigger block. It would look at it and say: nope not valid and be done with it. Changing the old version is a patch that makes it no longer an old version.\nWhy the heck people don't agree with this change?:\nCode:\nif blocksize&gt; 1MB then blocksize=1MB\nto\nCode:\nif blocksize&gt; 20MB then blocksize=20MB\nOf cause this is not the final solution since the blocksize would need to be &gt; 10GB in the future,\nbut it makes bitcoin stronger and buy us some time for a better solution,\nisn it?\nThe Green part\nis the reason Gavin Andresen wants the change. Gavin will go for hard fork only if 90% of the network is running on XT.\nThe Red part\nis the reason Gregory Maxwell does not want the change. GMaxwell is proposing the problem to be solved by implementing a very complex thing called lightning.netwrok.\nCan't we just go for the 20MB first, then use the time (years) we bought to properly test Gregory Maxwell 's lightning.netwrok again and again and if the result is all good, then we use it.\nGavin proposed exactly what you are proposing here. But, GMaxwell did not agree. Rumour is that GMaxwell's company blockstream, which has got 21M USD funding, is working on solving the lightning.netwrok problem and imlementation of sidechains. Hence GMaxwell wants 1 MB cap to stay so blockstream can reap the beneit of solving the problem. Due to this disagreement, Gavin said that if the consensus can not be reached at dev level, then it goes to the node level. Hence he asked people to use XT (which is currently almost identical to Bitcoin Core) to show support for him. If 50% of the bitcoin network run XT, then he'llrequest devs again to modify Bitcoin Core so that hard fork does not happen. If they still do not agree, he'll wait for the network to run 90% on XT and then implement the changes on XT. That is when hard fork happens, but with already 90% network running on XT, XT chain will invariably survive. In any case, none of this is going to happen before February 2016. All these things are now at discussion level.\nYou forgot\nanother reason\nfor opposing the biger block size\nBut it is clear at this point that inaction is not an option.  Not doing anything will bring a change too, just not a very good one.\nDint forget. But dint mention, because I have respect for GMaxwell and believe it is not as blunt as it has been portrayed.
