XT had probably had close to an economic consensus, however many bitcoin related companies that publicly supported XT were DDoS'ed, intimidating others from voicing their support, and mining pools who even allowed miners to show their support for XT were similarly DDoS'ed, making it difficult for anyone to show their support of XT. (also remember when someone sold 20,000\nBTC\non bitfinex within minutes/hours after the first block was found that \"voted\" for XT).\nBitcoin Classic has a similar amount of support among major economic bitcoin related companies, and the majority of mining pools have shown their support (based on hashrate).

Transaction space in blocks is a finite resource for which we charge fees.  As those fees rise, Bitcoin will slowly and seamlessly transition to a model where tiny transactions are handled by exchanges such as Coinbase, and transaction space in blocks is used primarily for settlement between exchanges and parties making larger trades.  This will happen so slowly, you'll barely notice it.\nIt is the height of hubris for the former developers, having failed to impose their vision of the code on the rest of us, to run around telling the press \"Bitcoin Has Failed.\"  They have failed.  Bitcoin is fine.\nLike most things in the P2P world, Bitcoin will last as long as at least two people are running a client, and it does something useful.  ed2k hasn't gone away, and will probably be here forever, along with Bitcoin.\nHuge minus man, you're blinded.\n", "author": "btcxyzzz Legendary Offline Activity: 886 Merit: 1000 Monero - secure, private and untraceable currency.
