The dollar is a state monopoly of the worst kind.\nThe U.S. dollar has actually become a major weapon in the hands of the U.S. government now. All bank transactions go through the U.S. SWIFT system. Even the Chinese and Russians, who have no love for the U.S. government, have to use dollars for international trade. They dont like it. Muslims all around the world are coming to feel that they are enemies of the United States, so they dont want to use the dollar either. And the more regulations the U.S. puts in place about how money is transferred and used  like FATCA  the harder people will look for alternatives.

After all, I already avoid sales tax by shop­ping online; and Im not going to vio­late tax laws.\nOn top of this, my favorite online retail­ers dont accept Bit­coin; so why exactly should I start using it?\nHow­ever, if one is doing some­thing ille­gal, then Bit­coin would seem to be more use­ful. As has been reported, Bit­coin has been used to sell ille­gal drugs online. Now, Bit­coin sup­port­ers claim that this is over­hyped and that these illicit deals are giv­ing Bit­coin a bad name. In real­ity, I see this as the only com­par­a­tive advan­tage of this cur­rency. Sure, one can still be tracked with Bit­coin, but it would be harder than a trans­fer from a credit card or bank account.\nBut since I have no inten­tion of buy­ing drugs online or off, the cur­rency is worth­less to me. So whats the point?\n4.  Bit­coin is free-market money. Since there are few prac­ti­cal rea­sons to use Bit­coin, the sup­port­ers grab onto the idea that its free-market money. Hence, were some­how sav­ing the world by using it. Thats a big rea­son that the sup­port­ers get so upset when any­one crit­i­cizes Bitcoin.\nBut here again, Bit­coin doesnt offer any­thing unique. If I want to invest in free-market money, I can buy gold and sil­ver  a store of value rec­og­nized around the world for centuries.\nUnless Im plan­ning some ille­gal trans­ac­tion, Bit­coin just doesnt seem like a use­ful prod­uct to me. For every­thing Bit­coins offer, other, bet­ter alter­na­tives already exist. Bit­coin is an inter­est­ing idea; I just dont find it useful.\nFor the rest of the issue, the Casey Research energy team will dis­cuss the release of the Strate­gic Petro­leum Reserve.

Let's work to innovate!\nAnd remember...innovation is not about moments of inspiration, it is an iterative repetitive process of analysis and design. Bitcoin is our framework to provide the solutions we tout bitcoin as solving, the only problem is that if we don't innovate to make these solutions a reality, then the true value of bitcoin will never be realized!\nGoogle trends shows interest as waning, what are we going to do that the next time bitcoin shows up in the popular media the news is of innovation?\n", "author": "YoYa Hero Member Offline Activity: 766 Merit: 500 (👁 ͜ʖ👁) Hello there!

The fork is a change in the protocol that allows for bigger blocks than the current 1 MB limit. I don't believe that the total number of coins is planned to change. Perhaps you are confusing the concept of larger blocks (measured in megabytes) with larger block rewards (which won't be affected by the fork):\nEach transaction that occurs on the block chain takes up a little bit of space, and these transactions all get squished into a virtual box (a block). Bitcoin currently operates with a 1MB limit. What this means is that only so much information it can process in each block, this currently comes to roughly seven transactions per second.\nThe discussion recently in the Bitcoin ecosphere has been to increase the block size to 20MB, thereby allowing more transactions in each block, increasing the transactions per second...\n...With Bitcoin-Xt, the plan is to go ahead with a big increase at first that will be followed by automatic incremental block size increases over time.\nLink:\nhttp://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-xt-pushing-ahead-bigger-blocks/\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-06-01 01:22:51", "content": "Moving to the new fork does this mean the 21 million coins are raised?\nNo.\nAnd the Lord will not alter any of the ten commandments either.\n", "author": "joecooin Sr. Member Offline Activity: 363 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-06-01 01:26:08", "content": "Moving to the new fork does this mean the 21 million coins are raised?\nNo the 21 million coins limit stays exactly the same whatever happens.

On the other hand, increasing the maximum block size isn't a question of \"if\" but \"when\". According to Satoshi, if Bitcoin is to ever reach the transaction volume that is expected of a major currency and scale as a payment system that can rival the current alternatives out there then it will need to accommodate a blockchain expansion rate that is much greater than today (the other alternative would be to increase dependence on centralized off-chain payment processing methods for smaller transactions which brings about a whole new set of problems):\nLong before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section eight) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.\nThe bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\nIf the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.\nLink:\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09964.html\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-06-01 14:43:46", "content": "Bitcoin limit should never be raised I don't understand why this keeps coming up and I think Gmaxwells alternative solution means adding in alt coins which would raise the amount which would get rid of the value by quite a bit I feel gavins approach would be the best.\n", "author": "Anatidaephobia Newbie Offline Activity: 11 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-06-01 14:45:15", "content": "I'll ber waiting for the dust to settle when this does take place that way I dont have to make a decision but keep my private keys and join the majority.\n", "author": "Barney Stinson Newbie Offline Activity: 18 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-06-01 14:47:15", "content": "Moving to the new fork does this mean the 21 million coins are raised?\nNo the 21 million coins limit stays exactly the same whatever happens.

Problem is, that's easier said than done and the proposals that we've seen so far have been shown to be far from perfect and tend to come with a host of\nproblems of their own\n(e.g.\nminer collusion\n).\nGavin also touched briefly on this subject in one of his blog posts:\nDynamic limits\nOne very popular idea is to implement a dynamic limit, based on historical block sizes.\nThe details vary: how often should the maximum size be adjusted? Every block? Every difficulty adjustment? How much of an increase should be allowed? 50% bigger? Double?\nIf the block size limit is just a denial-of-service prevention measure (preventing a big, evil miner from producing an 11 gigabyte block that the rest of the network is forced to validate), then any of these proposals will work. Engineers could bike-shed the parameter choice to death, but I like the idea of a simple dynamic limit on the maximum allowed size.\nThere are more complicated proposals for a dynamic block size limit that (for example) involve proof-of-stake voting or linking the maximum block size to the mining reward and/or the amount of fees in a block. I like them less than a simple solution, because consensus-critical code must be absolutely correct, and every additional line of code is another opportunity for a chain-splitting bug to slip through code review and testing...\nLink:\nhttp://gavinandresen.ninja/bigger-blocks-another-way\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-06-01 15:56:21", "content": "God damn this forums must be all newbies or what?

There should be no increase to the block size limit. There should be no attempt to keep transaction fees from hitting a market rate. The block size limit is a good thing. Real transaction fees will be a good thing. Any changes to the block size limit will hurt both of those, create a significant risk of major disaster, and damage the credibility of Bitcoin as a reliable system. The best thing for everybody involved would be for the proposed changes to be simply dropped, and Bitcoin developers to get on with making proper technical solutions rather than hacky patches.\nThe current proposals for raising the block size are reckless, unnecessary, and potentially disastrous.

If BitcoinXT code ends up being more popular, do you think that the existing Bitcoin Core devs will stick to their guns and maintain a platform no one uses? No way, they'll merge the desired features into Bitcoin Core and that will be the end of the argument, back to square one again.\nReally? I think the whole point of gavin extorting his will is that he can decide what will be done. So you are sure that the bitcoin xt wallet, and so the bitcoin blockchain, will not be decided by him and his friends? You know he wanted tainting and other things before, now he might see his chance to take over the development. I mean bitcoiners has chosen then. And there was a thread about his milestone plans where users wrote that they really dont like what he is planning. I didnt understand what it was about and didnt want to spend so much time in it. But i think even the way how he will switch shows what he wants.\nYes, of course people can switch back. Though im not sure what will happen if he implemented something and a couple blocks with a bad change were running. How many users will switch away from his blockchain then? I mean its a financial instrument and getting back coins you spent is nice, but not getting coins you got in these blocks is no fun.\nLet me know where im wrong, its not that im a pro in that area.\nBitcoinXT is open source - the same as Bitcoin Core. Every change committed change is subject to review and comment, so there would be no way for a developer even if they were the sole committer to make some sort of change that would be implemented without review.\nIf BitcoinXT becomes the majority and then something needs to be changed, it'll take months to move between soft or hard forks. It'll be planned and we'll know the level of consensus amongst nodes months in advance.\nIn short, there's no easy option for bitcoin devs to just make a fickle or odd change to the network without a chance for other devs to review and users to reject.\n", "author": "canth Legendary Offline Activity: 1442 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-06-28 20:47:56", "content": "BitcoinXT is open source - the same as Bitcoin Core.

XT could certainly continue merging contributions made from the ~304 developers who work on core, but there would be a new precedent set that we should ignore the consensus process with BIP on core and simply fork the main repository if we cannot get agreement.\nPersonally, I see nothing wrong with Gavin and Hearn's ability or right to fork core as that is how open source works and ultimately the miners and full nodes will decide which fork to use. I do find it revealing that Gavin decided to discuss the XT solution to bypass consensus before he submitted a BIP proposal. He must have expected disagreement and is using XT to leverage for a change to core.\nFrom the looks of it we may see a few developers walk away when consensus is reached which will be bad for everyone because all of them have made great contributions in the past.\nI look forward to adjustments in the proposed BIP's or new ones that we all can rally behind. We need to start listening to each other a bit more and addressing each others concerns. Perhaps if Gavin's proposal could be merged with Garziks and there are other changes proposed that address some of the concerns with centralization or giving to much control to the miners.\n", "author": "BitUsher Hero Member Offline Activity: 840 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-06-28 21:03:27", "content": "What if XT nodes gained in support and it's approaching majority, then core devs decides to support the XT's blocksize limit and implement the proposal into core?

All the fans download the client and thats it.\nIm still not sure what will happen when gaving and hearn would implement tainting in their client and many newbs got aware that some coins might be worth less than others. Or if bitcoin xt would really become THE chain. Would a bad thing implemented be possibly made rolled back in any circumstances without leaving bitcoin behind hurt?\nIf Bitcoin XT gets a majority, rest assured that there will be more than 2 developers contributing and reviewing code. Even if it's solely Hearn or Gavin that get commit access, every submission will get reviewed. If something controversial is committed, rest assured there will be a migration away from Bitcoin XT.\nIt doesn't matter if it's Bitcoin Core or XT or some other version - you're getting the same level of review unless developers leave the project and go work on Doge or something.\nI see what you mean. Review\nafter\nthe release might happen. Though that might mean that already alot of people downloaded the client and made transactions on, maybe a fork. Surely they could switch away but a potential harm might be done already.\nYou dont fear something like that happening at all?\nOn top of that, what do you think if a reasonable high amount of users think the bitcoin xt bitcoins are the one with value and the rest thinks it the unforked bitcoin core? When they are not compatible then you have copied a currency and both chains fans believe their coin is the real deal. Maybe even exchanges are undecided. You simply dont copy a currency and have double the value. So what do you think will happen?\nMiners take months or more to upgrade and they are really the only ones who can fork the network - aka, create blocks that are rejected by other legitimate nodes. No, I'm not really concerned about the evil software upgrade that gets pushed out overnight and perhaps a few hundred users run. Hell, for a new user it takes nearly a day on modern hardware to get caught up with the full blockchain. There's very little damage that can be done short of a \"steal your private keys and send them to FTP site\" type of hack - and there's no fixing that. Put a gun to any of the core devs head and they'll push out a hacked version of Bitcoin Core - it's the other devs that review it, warn others and in the case of Core, roll back changes.\nWe're going to know long before we have a forked chain whether or not XT nodes have a clear majority. If they do, I don't imagine that the core devs are going to sit on their hands - they'll capitulate and this larger block controversy will go away. Alternatively, XT could fail to gain attraction and then it's not much of a concern.\nThis is a lot of handwringing over something important but that will ultimately be resolved smoothly.\nYoure right. Sounds like a big problem wont arise. Only thing that might be possible is that some people might download it and use the old blockchain as base to run the new client. They might send their coins to someone and he doesnt get it because the transaction is only on the wrong chain. Or he might send his coins from the old wallet to the new one. Which might mean having sent their real bitcoins to an address that doesnt have a corresponding on the real chain. Though it should be possible to import the keys from the altchain into the old chain\nand get the coins back as long as the private keys system wasnt changed.\nDoes that sound right?

Though there might be situation where the blockchain is changed so that the downloaded wallet is working, you only cant get back anymore. Malfunctions would be something that could be avoided if the alert would be misused for a \"bad plan\". You want that this plan works. In order to do that you would chose a change that would make the new client work fine... but you cant switch back. In fact you always can but it might be that you always were harmed. Lets say the new client creates transactions that only verify on the new client but not on the old one. Receiving and sending coins would be no problem but when you realize you have to switch back already some bad situation might have happened. Coins you didnt receive in reality or so.\nYes, most probably the community would react fast. But i mean the weakest are the one in danger. We have enough newbies that make failure and we might have many downloads of a client when the alert is good enough. You dont check forums when it says you need to do instantly... else harm... maybe.\nI agree, of course, that its a theoretical problem. Only... bitcoin and bad news is such a thing... We want it to be a trustworthy currency. Tales of vanishing coins surely will have a huge negative impact.

The only risk is then that someone catches the private key. I'm not sure if it makes sense to do so for a scammer.\nWell if you use this address to possibly secure and restore your account here, the private key is essentially worth what your account would be in case of a sale. It would probably not be possible to sell the account, but if there is a dispute over who should own the account it is my experience that theymos just does not restore it and whoever has it keeps it. You might have other options to proof that its yours though, just a thought.\nPlus what Muhammed Zakir said. Its certainly a valid option to handle a raw private key for this, but I dont see any reason.

Nothing's going to change that limit.\nActually, the 21 million coin limit can be raised at any time, and most probably will be in the future.\nIt's not really a fair comparison, although I understand what you're saying.\nVirtually nobody would support a fork that increases the total number of coins. On the other hand, increasing the maximum block size isn't a question of \"if\" but \"when\". According to Satoshi, if Bitcoin is to ever reach the transaction volume that is expected of a major currency and scale as a payment system that can rival the current alternatives out there then it will need to accommodate a blockchain expansion rate that is much greater than today (the other alternative would be to increase dependence on centralized off-chain payment processing methods for smaller transactions which brings about a whole new set of problems):\nLong before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section eight) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.\nThe bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\nIf the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.\nLink:\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09964.html\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-06-01 14:43:46", "content": "Bitcoin limit should never be raised I don't understand why this keeps coming up and I think Gmaxwells alternative solution means adding in alt coins which would raise the amount which would get rid of the value by quite a bit I feel gavins approach would be the best.\n", "author": "Anatidaephobia Newbie Offline Activity: 11 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-06-01 14:45:15", "content": "I'll ber waiting for the dust to settle when this does take place that way I dont have to make a decision but keep my private keys and join the majority.\n", "author": "Barney Stinson Newbie Offline Activity: 18 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-06-01 14:47:15", "content": "Moving to the new fork does this mean the 21 million coins are raised?\nNo the 21 million coins limit stays exactly the same whatever happens.

Staying 1MB is equally stupid.\nBut the total supply will always be 21, unless you want an instant dump of epic proportions.\nI agree that a variable block size limit which scales according to the needs of the network would be preferable to one that is fixed since the latter is only really a temporary fix, as you said. Problem is, that's easier said than done and the proposals that we've seen so far have been shown to be far from perfect and tend to come with a host of\nproblems of their own\n(e.g.\nminer collusion\n).\nGavin also touched briefly on this subject in one of his blog posts:\nDynamic limits\nOne very popular idea is to implement a dynamic limit, based on historical block sizes.\nThe details vary: how often should the maximum size be adjusted? Every block? Every difficulty adjustment? How much of an increase should be allowed? 50% bigger? Double?\nIf the block size limit is just a denial-of-service prevention measure (preventing a big, evil miner from producing an 11 gigabyte block that the rest of the network is forced to validate), then any of these proposals will work. Engineers could bike-shed the parameter choice to death, but I like the idea of a simple dynamic limit on the maximum allowed size.\nThere are more complicated proposals for a dynamic block size limit that (for example) involve proof-of-stake voting or linking the maximum block size to the mining reward and/or the amount of fees in a block. I like them less than a simple solution, because consensus-critical code must be absolutely correct, and every additional line of code is another opportunity for a chain-splitting bug to slip through code review and testing...\nLink:\nhttp://gavinandresen.ninja/bigger-blocks-another-way\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-06-01 15:56:21", "content": "God damn this forums must be all newbies or what?

XT could certainly continue merging contributions made from the ~304 developers who work on core, but there would be a new precedent set that we should ignore the consensus process with BIP on core and simply fork the main repository if we cannot get agreement.\nPersonally, I see nothing wrong with Gavin and Hearn's ability or right to fork core as that is how open source works and ultimately the miners and full nodes will decide which fork to use. I do find it revealing that Gavin decided to discuss the XT solution to bypass consensus before he submitted a BIP proposal. He must have expected disagreement and is using XT to leverage for a change to core.\nFrom the looks of it we may see a few developers walk away when consensus is reached which will be bad for everyone because all of them have made great contributions in the past.\nI look forward to adjustments in the proposed BIP's or new ones that we all can rally behind. We need to start listening to each other a bit more and addressing each others concerns. Perhaps if Gavin's proposal could be merged with Garziks and there are other changes proposed that address some of the concerns with centralization or giving to much control to the miners.\n", "author": "BitUsher Hero Member Offline Activity: 840 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-06-28 21:03:27", "content": "What if XT nodes gained in support and it's approaching majority, then core devs decides to support the XT's blocksize limit and implement the proposal into core?

Though there might be situation where the blockchain is changed so that the downloaded wallet is working, you only cant get back anymore. Malfunctions would be something that could be avoided if the alert would be misused for a \"bad plan\". You want that this plan works. In order to do that you would chose a change that would make the new client work fine... but you cant switch back. In fact you always can but it might be that you always were harmed. Lets say the new client creates transactions that only verify on the new client but not on the old one. Receiving and sending coins would be no problem but when you realize you have to switch back already some bad situation might have happened. Coins you didnt receive in reality or so.\nYes, most probably the community would react fast. But i mean the weakest are the one in danger. We have enough newbies that make failure and we might have many downloads of a client when the alert is good enough. You dont check forums when it says you need to do instantly... else harm... maybe.\nI agree, of course, that its a theoretical problem. Only... bitcoin and bad news is such a thing... We want it to be a trustworthy currency. Tales of vanishing coins surely will have a huge negative impact.
