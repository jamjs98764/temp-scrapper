What they really want to do, is to group crypto users into groups.\nIn the end you will have one group, who will use the &lt;public&gt; Blockchain (Cypherpunks and Anarchists) and the rest will use their &lt;private&gt; Blockchain. (The one they supposedly created for everyone else)\nThey are masters in what they have been doing for years. They even use\nyour\nmoney to create their own &lt;private&gt; distributed ledger or &lt;private&gt; Blockchain technology.\nEven though we don't know what will banks do and which direction will take surely, I tend to agree a bit more with your assessment. In my opinion, they will very hardly just adopt our blockchain. This would mean that they would lose a lot of possible control that they love to have and that they just would have with one of their own private blockchains.\nI guess we will see everything.\n", "author": "Mickeyb Hero Member Offline Activity: 798 Merit: 1000 Move On !!!!!!

That's not to say that I'm content right now with the level of control that I and others can exercise over our own lives, I want that to change and all people to have more control, and it's obvious that Bitcoin and cryptographic technology in general will play a huge role doing it.

Decentralisation means no single entity has control over Bitcoin. It also increases the networkÂ’s security by eliminating points of vulnerability. The network is a peer-to-peer (p2p) network, much like BitTorrent.\n-Digital - Imagine Bitcoin as an email application that allows you to send money. Payments can be sent and received on any computing device with an internet connection, instantly, anywhere. Just like you can access your email account on any computer in the world with an internet connection, the Bitcoin network allows you to access your money wherever you are if you wish to.\n-Highly Divisible - People often ask Â“if one bitcoin is worth so much money, how can I possibly pay for small things?Â” The answer lies in the fact that a bitcoin is highly divisible. Like a dollar can be divided into 100 cents, a single bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 satoshis - that's a hundred millionth of a bitcoin!\n-Frictionless - As said before, a bitcoin can be sent to anyone, anywhere, at any time, for free. Transaction fees are drastically lowered for both consumers and merchants using bitcoin. This feature, combined with bitcoinÂ’s divisibility, allows you to pay one tenth of a cent or a million dollars without transaction fees.\n-Volatile - BitcoinÂ’s price volatility has been a major cause for concern amongst people new to the currency. Whilst this is an issue, bitcoinÂ’s volatility is a product of it being a new, young, and illiquid market. This dangerous volatility will pass as bitcoin becomes more established. In addition to this, there are easy ways for merchants accepting bitcoin to overcome these volatility problems.\n-Pseudonymous - Media sources report bitcoin as being an Â“anonymousÂ”currency like cash, this is incorrect. Bitcoin is not anonymous. Since every transaction that ever takes place in the Bitcoin network is recorded in the blockchain, the identity of any person involved in a transaction is only protected by their ability to deny their association with that bitcoin address. Once your identity is linked to a bitcoin address, everything you do through that address can be tracked.\n-Irrevocable once sent - Like cash, once you pay someone, there is no way to get that money back without the recipientÂ’s approval.

If we speak about low fees , well fees are little bit higher with exchange aswell , and if we speak about being anonymous well It's not anonymous when you use your PayPal or Credit card or Bank account on the exchange website since your name will be visible . The major problem on all this is Exchange which are trying to change Bitcoin nature , there is nothing better then Trading on Decentralized Platform like LocalBitcoins (may need ID verification) or on Bitcointalk currency exchange section .\nI my self don't have to worry about all this because I don't use exchange websites but if I have to choose best Property I'd have to say it's being Irreversible because I don't have to worry for six months if the sender will chargeback or not and if he will scam me or not .\n", "author": "OmegaStarScream Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1414 Merit: 1101 Hire BOUNTYPORTALS&gt;Bounty management goo.gl/XKv9TK "}, {"date": "2015-09-28 08:09:53", "content": "I would say that the most important aspects are decentralization and pseudo anonymity.

This feature, combined with bitcoinÂ’s divisibility, allows you to pay one tenth of a cent or a million dollars without transaction fees.\nTo a certain degree you are right, but if you send out transactions as you say being worth a tenth of a cent, which is currently considered dust, it mostly won't get confirmed within the very first blocks if there isn't a decent fee added. Actually, pools tend to ignore these transactions which could make you having to wait plenty of hours for a single confirmation.

Marketing is essential to just about every business and is a good thing when used responsibly. Plenty of companies out there market their products and brands they way they should be.\nAnd then there are the companies that donÂ’t. Specifically, IÂ’m referring to 21 Inc, the company behind the 21 Bitcoin Computer. They make numerous claims on their website that I have issue with:\nÂ“Plug in your 21 Bitcoin Computer to get a stream of bitcoin on your Mac, Windows, or Linux laptop.Â”\nÂ“The 21 Bitcoin Chip means your 21 Bitcoin Computer has access to a constantly replenished source of bitcoin.Â”\nÂ“Â…you can now write programs that connect to the Bitcoin network just as easily as they connect to the Internet.Â”\nÂ“Â…itÂ’s a tool for making passive income at home by selling access to your software and assets for bitcoin.Â”\nAll of the above are true statements, as far as I can tell. But they are misleading true statements. Here are my rebuttals:\nThe computer/chip will not net you any profit in mined bitcoin. There are too many people out there with far more power to mine bitcoin, vastly lowering your chance of earning anything.\nSee above. Any money earned (say, through a mining pool) will be insignificant.\nThis has always been possible. In no way is this new.\nIf you have a product to sell in exchange for bitcoin, then you likely have a product to sell for dollars (or other currency). If your customers only pay via bitcoin, then there are many,many,many options out there for receiving bitcoin. Want to avoid the fees? YouÂ’d better plan on earning more than $80,000 to justify buying a $400 computer for your payments system (based on StripeÂ’s 0.5% fee structure). Oh, and there are some great open source libraries to do this for you for free. No specialized hardware needed.\nSome people argue this will revolutionize IoT. Really? Our toasters will be buying/selling on our behalf? Will I be pimping out my coffee maker to my neighbors? All jokes aside, this can all be done with just a Raspberry Pi.\nÂ“Bitcoin-enablingÂ” everything could have some useful applications, but I donÂ’t see this as a practical way forward. For example, a hardware implementation of something like the bitcoin protocol/blockcain could be useful in IoT (or computing in general) if it was used for general purpose transactions, like messaging (see Ethereum). Unfortunately this isnÂ’t the case, nor is this how the product is marketed.\nMaybe IÂ’m being overly critical of a first-gen product, but I just donÂ’t see why this is useful or why its been getting so much attention. Essentially, youÂ’re paying $400 for a Raspberry Pi ($40), an under-powered mining/blockchain chip, and some pre-installed software.\nJust take a look at the Hacker News comments on this. To me, that says it all. This is a developer-focused product, and the developers arenÂ’t impressed.\nTo summarize why IÂ’m disappointed:\nThe misleading marketing speak\nThe $400 price tag\nThe amount of press backing up the misleading claims\nThe ridiculous amount of funding with little to show\nI hate to be critical and not offer an alternative solution, so here is what you should do instead of buying the 21 Bitcoin Computer:\nBuy a Raspberry Pi\nInstall Bitcore\nBuy and attach one of the many USB miners\nInstall BFGMiner\nGood luck, have fun.\nI write at stackabuse.com, tweet from @ScottWRobinson, and occasionally post code to Github.\nScott Robinson\n", "views": 748, "author": "yenxz Sr. Member Offline Activity: 294 Merit: 250 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarketing Bitcoin to the Masses: Selling 21 on Ignorance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-09-26 19:18:14", "content": "I agree...

Decentralisation means no single entity has control over Bitcoin. It also increases the networkÂ’s security by eliminating points of vulnerability. The network is a peer-to-peer (p2p) network, much like BitTorrent.\n-Digital - Imagine Bitcoin as an email application that allows you to send money. Payments can be sent and received on any computing device with an internet connection, instantly, anywhere. Just like you can access your email account on any computer in the world with an internet connection, the Bitcoin network allows you to access your money wherever you are if you wish to.\n-Highly Divisible - People often ask Â“if one bitcoin is worth so much money, how can I possibly pay for small things?Â” The answer lies in the fact that a bitcoin is highly divisible. Like a dollar can be divided into 100 cents, a single bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 satoshis - that's a hundred millionth of a bitcoin!\n-Frictionless - As said before, a bitcoin can be sent to anyone, anywhere, at any time, for free. Transaction fees are drastically lowered for both consumers and merchants using bitcoin. This feature, combined with bitcoinÂ’s divisibility, allows you to pay one tenth of a cent or a million dollars without transaction fees.\n-Volatile - BitcoinÂ’s price volatility has been a major cause for concern amongst people new to the currency. Whilst this is an issue, bitcoinÂ’s volatility is a product of it being a new, young, and illiquid market. This dangerous volatility will pass as bitcoin becomes more established. In addition to this, there are easy ways for merchants accepting bitcoin to overcome these volatility problems.\n-Pseudonymous - Media sources report bitcoin as being an Â“anonymousÂ”currency like cash, this is incorrect. Bitcoin is not anonymous. Since every transaction that ever takes place in the Bitcoin network is recorded in the blockchain, the identity of any person involved in a transaction is only protected by their ability to deny their association with that bitcoin address. Once your identity is linked to a bitcoin address, everything you do through that address can be tracked.\n-Irrevocable once sent - Like cash, once you pay someone, there is no way to get that money back without the recipientÂ’s approval.

Actually, pools tend to ignore these transactions which could make you having to wait plenty of hours for a single confirmation.

Marketing is essential to just about every business and is a good thing when used responsibly. Plenty of companies out there market their products and brands they way they should be.\nAnd then there are the companies that donÂ’t. Specifically, IÂ’m referring to 21 Inc, the company behind the 21 Bitcoin Computer. They make numerous claims on their website that I have issue with:\nÂ“Plug in your 21 Bitcoin Computer to get a stream of bitcoin on your Mac, Windows, or Linux laptop.Â”\nÂ“The 21 Bitcoin Chip means your 21 Bitcoin Computer has access to a constantly replenished source of bitcoin.Â”\nÂ“Â…you can now write programs that connect to the Bitcoin network just as easily as they connect to the Internet.Â”\nÂ“Â…itÂ’s a tool for making passive income at home by selling access to your software and assets for bitcoin.Â”\nAll of the above are true statements, as far as I can tell. But they are misleading true statements. Here are my rebuttals:\nThe computer/chip will not net you any profit in mined bitcoin. There are too many people out there with far more power to mine bitcoin, vastly lowering your chance of earning anything.\nSee above. Any money earned (say, through a mining pool) will be insignificant.\nThis has always been possible. In no way is this new.\nIf you have a product to sell in exchange for bitcoin, then you likely have a product to sell for dollars (or other currency). If your customers only pay via bitcoin, then there are many,many,many options out there for receiving bitcoin. Want to avoid the fees? YouÂ’d better plan on earning more than $80,000 to justify buying a $400 computer for your payments system (based on StripeÂ’s 0.5% fee structure). Oh, and there are some great open source libraries to do this for you for free. No specialized hardware needed.\nSome people argue this will revolutionize IoT. Really? Our toasters will be buying/selling on our behalf? Will I be pimping out my coffee maker to my neighbors? All jokes aside, this can all be done with just a Raspberry Pi.\nÂ“Bitcoin-enablingÂ” everything could have some useful applications, but I donÂ’t see this as a practical way forward. For example, a hardware implementation of something like the bitcoin protocol/blockcain could be useful in IoT (or computing in general) if it was used for general purpose transactions, like messaging (see Ethereum). Unfortunately this isnÂ’t the case, nor is this how the product is marketed.\nMaybe IÂ’m being overly critical of a first-gen product, but I just donÂ’t see why this is useful or why its been getting so much attention. Essentially, youÂ’re paying $400 for a Raspberry Pi ($40), an under-powered mining/blockchain chip, and some pre-installed software.\nJust take a look at the Hacker News comments on this. To me, that says it all. This is a developer-focused product, and the developers arenÂ’t impressed.\nTo summarize why IÂ’m disappointed:\nThe misleading marketing speak\nThe $400 price tag\nThe amount of press backing up the misleading claims\nThe ridiculous amount of funding with little to show\nI hate to be critical and not offer an alternative solution, so here is what you should do instead of buying the 21 Bitcoin Computer:\nBuy a Raspberry Pi\nInstall Bitcore\nBuy and attach one of the many USB miners\nInstall BFGMiner\nGood luck, have fun.\nI write at stackabuse.com, tweet from @ScottWRobinson, and occasionally post code to Github.\nScott Robinson\n", "views": 748, "author": "yenxz Sr. Member Offline Activity: 294 Merit: 250 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarketing Bitcoin to the Masses: Selling 21 on Ignorance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-09-26 19:18:14", "content": "I agree...

By any means, do you have a link on where you've read that they lost $2M because of the scheme you posted above?\nsimple: everyone who now still works at bitpay now has to work that much harder/smarter or they will fail as a company.\n", "author": "smoothie Legendary Offline Activity: 2100 Merit: 1005 LEALANA Monero Physical Silver Coins "}, {"date": "2015-09-27 05:45:00", "content": "So what would happen to all of the companies that accept Bitcoin through Bitpay if Bitpay is to cease its existence?

Nothing good will come out of this I am afraid!\nNonsense. Pure nonsense\nBitcoin doesn't exist to buy game credits on Microsoft store.\nThe reason why they have to cut costs is that barely any of their merchants are seeing any sale from Bitcoin acceptance and therefore they aren't generating any revenue whatsoever.\nI'm more convinced that the hack of $2million is the reason for the lay offs and cost cutting.\n", "author": "smoothie Legendary Offline Activity: 2100 Merit: 1005 LEALANA Monero Physical Silver Coins "}, {"date": "2015-09-27 08:38:03", "content": "This is very bad news for the bitcoin industry.

This quote pretty much sums up where the company is headed with its current team.\nBest chance of survival would be to replace the guy that sent 1.8 million to the wrong person, and that Italian guy that flies around the world burning through cash telling everyone how great the business is doing. Step one in a turn-around must include replacing both these individuals.\nStep two. Processing 2000 transactions a day can be handled by 1 or 2 employees, add one for sales and one for reception, and anything over a staff of 5 is overkill. Shift the focus to include payroll integration like bitwage and quit burning cash.
