Has it?\nStuff that involves a lot of money and complications takes years to go to court. There are a ton of different investigations that happen where they look into every part of someones life. They are most likely pulling all the records from every place his computer has ever connected to the internet. They need to establish instances where he was say, in view of a camera while on the internet doing something so they can prove he did \"X\" on other things to.\nThere might be even more charges they bring up because once they dig through everything for awhile more stuff might come out.\nYes it is unfortunate about people supporting him, the sad reality is that people who do support him are blinded by ideology and video games and the internet. They live in this different kind of world, of which I am also part of, but I am grounded pretty solid in other things that take me away from the computer. Shooting guns, hanging with friends, playing magic the gathering again(lots of fun), reading interesting fiction and non fiction books, keeping up with a lot of news sources.\nBut then you get these people who I swear get their news from The Onion News or something like Tickld or other bogus places. Then they root for DPR and its just sickening, especially if all of the stuff the police press release said is all true its even scarier, of people putting out hits on people using bitcoins and using laundering services that throw your coins around to make you truly antonymous and sending it through exchanges and all these things. That takes things to a whole new level, because i would imagine it is really hard to find a real hit man and speak to them person to person and then most of the time it is a cop and they arrest you.

And even then, they are too expensive to gain wide adoption. Meanwhile, let's find resourceful uses for existing technologies. In many countries, they don't wait to be able to afford just the right tool to get something done, they do what needs to be done with what they have. A printer like this has many possible uses and is available off the shelf at any photography store. Paper wallets are one of the most commonly used method of offline storage and arguably the most secure. There are many possible uses for paper wallets that have not yet been explored. It seems this is a perennial topic and yet everyone still focuses on pure electronic solutions rather than hybrid physical/electronic ones. Personally, I won't be satisfied that a wallet is truly secure until it is integrated into a\nbrain chip\n, but that's just me.\n", "author": "cbeast Donator Legendary Offline Activity: 1736 Merit: 1000 Let's talk governance, lipstick, and pigs.

They live in this different kind of world, of which I am also part of, but I am grounded pretty solid in other things that take me away from the computer. Shooting guns, hanging with friends, playing magic the gathering again(lots of fun), reading interesting fiction and non fiction books, keeping up with a lot of news sources.\nBut then you get these people who I swear get their news from The Onion News or something like Tickld or other bogus places. Then they root for DPR and its just sickening, especially if all of the stuff the police press release said is all true its even scarier, of people putting out hits on people using bitcoins and using laundering services that throw your coins around to make you truly antonymous and sending it through exchanges and all these things. That takes things to a whole new level, because i would imagine it is really hard to find a real hit man and speak to them person to person and then most of the time it is a cop and they arrest you.

Simply use a mobile and laptop with the same wallet and send the same coin twice?\nThere's nothing to test, it is all statistically defined.  Quite frankly, while it isn't necessarily obvious why 10 minutes was chosen without statistics, some effects of changes to the target block length are obvious without statistics:\n1)  The more frequently blocks are created, the less efficient the blocks wil be in terms of storage (each block takes a minimum amount of disk space, the more transactions are in it, the more space it will take, but the less of the total space used is wasted just to record blocks vs actually storing transactions).\n2)  The easier blocks are to create (vs a difficulty-based time-target), the more frequently multiple nodes will be submitting competing blocks\n3)  The easier it is to create blocks, the easier it is to create a chain of blocks secretly and release it in any kind of attack (double-spend, \"51%\", etc)\nAnother way to word why we are sure of this:  Security of a transaction is not directly based on the number of blocks, it is based on how much hash power is behind confirmation and how long it has been behind it.  With a 10 minute block average, you need enough computing power and luck to override 10 minutes worth of work from the entire network.  With a one minute block average and two blocks, you only need enough hash power and luck to override 2 minutes worth of work from the entire network.  To remove the imagined first block convenience, you can also look at it this way: 11 blocks is going to come around on the two-minute network before 2 blocks comes around on the 10-minute network, so assuming equal computing power, you sometimes have slightly more security slightly sooner on a network with shorter blocks, but that doesn't make it valuable enough to ignore points (1) and (2) above.\nRegarding the \"imagined first block convenience\": the protocol states that all nodes will broadcast a valid transaction when they see it (a valid transaction does not use inputs from another transaction that is already showing on the network, preventing double-spends from using the entire network [double-spends have to be made via secret mining or broadcast of two transactions at the same time &lt;within a fraction of a second&gt; so only part of the network is working on each of them, neither of which are guaranteed to be successful]).  Statistically (as in, before you take into account that payment providers are centralized), this means that an unconfirmed transaction is generally on most of the network when a merchant sees it.  Given this, and considering the expense one would incur to perform a double-spend and the laws one would be breaking as well, it is simply not worth it to attempt to double-spend for any transaction where you aren't scamming someone out of a very significant amount of money, so merchants generally don't need to wait for confirmations as long as the transaction can be reasonably expected to complete (for instance, it has a fee).  For transactions where a double-spend would be worthwhile (probably buying something at least as or perhaps more expensive than a car), waiting for multiple confirmations is not really a big deal, and quicker confirmations would probably mean waiting for more confirmations anyway.\nThe only potentially real convenience to a quicker block confirmation I have seen suggested by anyone was by AliceWonder, and that is if you spend from one input, and need to spend from the change output of that transaction down the street, you might not be able to send the new transaction until there is a confirmation, but I don't think that is 100% true.  I believe it is possible to create and send transactions from unconfirmed outputs, they just can't confirm until their parent transactions do, too.  However, even if that weren't possible, if bitcoin were common enough to be spending it in two places in close proximity to one another in a less than 10 minute average interval, and you had enough bitcoin to be spending at each of these places, there is no reason you couldn't have multiple inputs to spend from separately with just a little bit of planning.  To that end, there are a lot of shops where you can't get change for a $100 bill, so it's not like planning ahead to split up the inputs is any different than planning ahead to have five $20 bills instead of one $100 bill.  ETA: and you can make the change yourself instead of having to go to a bank or out of your way to a big store that can make change for the $100 bill.\n", "author": "The00Dustin Hero Member Offline Activity: 807 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-07-31 15:55:17", "content": "For regular people and real world daily use shorter block times are superior, no question about it.\nIf you're not comfortable making a regular size transaction on one confirmation then there are bigger problems at play.\nYes, some hash will be wasted.

And even then, they are too expensive to gain wide adoption. Meanwhile, let's find resourceful uses for existing technologies. In many countries, they don't wait to be able to afford just the right tool to get something done, they do what needs to be done with what they have. A printer like this has many possible uses and is available off the shelf at any photography store. Paper wallets are one of the most commonly used method of offline storage and arguably the most secure. There are many possible uses for paper wallets that have not yet been explored. It seems this is a perennial topic and yet everyone still focuses on pure electronic solutions rather than hybrid physical/electronic ones. Personally, I won't be satisfied that a wallet is truly secure until it is integrated into a\nbrain chip\n, but that's just me.\n", "author": "cbeast Donator Legendary Offline Activity: 1736 Merit: 1000 Let's talk governance, lipstick, and pigs.

(And those proceeds forwarded to 'real' creditors)\nCreditors don't just mean people who are owed cash they are anyone who is owed anything by the entity.  For example lets say you drop off your car for work at a service station and the mechanic destroys it and they are also in financial trouble and declare bankruptcy.  You are owed a car (or equal financial compensation of the car's value).  The fact that the company owes you a car doesn't exclude you as a creditor.  I mean would that make any sense at all?  \"Sorry the dealership owes you a $50,000 car not $50,000 in cash and they don't have it so you lose everything\".  Of course it wouldn't.   In Bankruptcy the court would consider you a $50,000 creditor just like another creditor who is owed $50,000 in cash.\nThe only question in the MtGox case is will the court allow \"some\" of the BTC to be returned to the creditors owed bitcoins or will the court sell all the BTC and pay all creditors in cash.  Obviously the BTC creditors would prefer the former as selling a huge amount of BTC likely means crashing the price, incurring trading fees, and then the creditors just get less \"value\" back.  Either way the BTC creditors are creditors.   It doesn't matter if the courts see BTC as \"money\" owed or \"property\" owed.  All debts are debts.\n", "author": "DeathAndTaxes Donator Legendary Offline Activity: 1218 Merit: 1005 Gerald Davis "}, {"date": "2014-08-03 06:18:40", "content": "forget about them and move on with your life gox will never return the money at all cost\nsee why mark is still free its like a politician who stole a lot of money from people they will put it in thetycourt then what will happen? he will not give the people's money sure he will get sue but since that we are talking about digital currency i dunno how will the authority handle this\nHe's also said to have taken a lot of 'real' money.
