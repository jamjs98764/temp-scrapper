I think it's a historical manifesto since it puts forth a clear way to end world hunger.\n______________________\nThis is my official thread about what I envisioned many years ago that the world now calls Bitcoin. I am releasing my GLOBAL CREDIT FUND manifesto below and this thread is the first public release of what I envision as a future global world currency system for the people of this planet. The manifesto puts forth a way to bring equal wealth to everyone on the planet through a new global credit fund in which every person on the planet has an equal share. The project could eliminate world hunger as soon as it is put into use. Â First a few words on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is being abused by those that seek to use it now for profit and power. Do not trust the current people and groups trying to use what I have envisioned.\nDO NOT TRUST\nBitcoin Foundation\nCurrent Version of Bitcoin Core\nThe Bitcoin Core Developers\nGavin\nBitcoin Talk\nNow I shall reveal the manifesto that brings equality in wealth and eliminates world hunger to the world.\nGLOBAL CREDIT FUND MANIFESTO\n12/01/2014\nwww.GlobalCreditFund.org\nA new global currency credit system will soon be launched, it will involve 9 quantum computers located in 9 diverse areas of the planet and there will be only one wallet system to access the network. Every person on the planet will be assigned one wallet for their entire lives and each wallet will be created with no costs and will have only 1 credit in that wallet. The wallet owner may do what they wish with their one credit. They can use it wisely or use it foolishly. Each wallet can receive and send any fraction of credits in their wallet. The 9 quantum servers will be governed by one international body that will be known as the Supreme Council and this council will not have any control or connection to any government or business. The Supreme Council will have 9 council members that I will choose as the first council of the new global currency credit system that I have named today December 1st 2014 the Global Credit Fund.\nThe new cryptography used to operate the Global Credit Fund managed by the Supreme Council is a new generation of cryptography that is necessary due to how all existing cryptography has become corrupted by various groups including the NSA and the organizations they control such as NiST and ENISA which allows these powers that be to decipher all activities that use any form of crypto.\nECC was developed many years ago by Professor Hendrik Lenstra who is connected to intelligence agencies. The idea that any major figure in cryptography is allowed to operate free from any intelligence agency supervision or control is ludicrous. Various other forms of ECC have been created including Koblitz Curves which was created by an NSA spy named professor Neal Koblitz. Neal Koblitz has worked for the NSA since the 1960Â’s when he was a student at Harvard and they funded his long trip to Moscow as an academic.\nIn 1995 the ENNISA document was released to the world via Usenet and I am very familiar with it. Since then, the NSA has tried to delete any mention of the ENNISA document and the ENNISA formula from Usenet archives since it described 30 Mod, 60 Mod and 90 Mod prime algorithms and prime theory. However, if you know where to look, the theory still exists on the net and it can be traced back to 1995 when it was released to destroy all modern cryptography as it has done. Around 2005 a doctoral student of Dr. Lenstra tried to take credit for the 60 Mod prime algorithm described in the 1995 work known as the ENNISA FORMULA Â in a paper he co-authored that is now known as the Sieve of Atkin. The doctoral student of Dr. Lenstra was Daniel Bernstein who did not discover 60 Mod Prime Theory; it was fully formulated in 1995 in the ENNISA FORMULA. It is time to give credit for the amazing prime theories discovered in 1995 to the person that discovered these formulas. The author of the ENNISA FORMULA in 1995 discovered 30 Mod, 60 Mod and 90 Mod prime theories. This is how the NSA has corrupted all modern encryption by understanding these formulas.\nThe person that created it was silenced and discredited by the NSA and Mossad as well as Mi6 since the ENNISA algorithm allows the creation of corrupt seed keys by groups such as the NSA and then the corrupt seed keys are released through NSA controlled organizations such as NiST and ENISA. Â This is what the Snowden documents are trying to reveal to the world, that there is no current cryptography that is secure since for almost twenty years the NSA has held the skeleton keys to modern crypto and that key is the ENNISA FORMULA.\nThe coins mined years ago that created what is now called bitcoin will be used to fund this new global secure network that will be known as the GLOBAL CREDIT FUND and it will operate in the ether of cyber space above the cloud. The servers will use a new form of data load and a new type of crypto involving dimensional math and dimensional computer languages. These new computer languages will be the first generation of AI (Artificial Intelligence) computer languages that will use 36 bit/byte and 90 bit/byte data loads. Modern computers have used binary 8 bit/byte data loads for many decades now and they are obsolete.\nGREED and POWER have destroyed the concept of Bitcoin. The new Global Digital Currency Credit Network will have a set number of credits that will be divisible to 16 decimal places to begin with and then it can expand to any number of decimals that the network needs. Like Bitcoin, this new digital valued credit will promote the deflation of goods as more and more people adopt a trust worthy currency unit that is not controlled by any government or business but only the council of 9. The trust of the people of the world in the new global credit fund will be the reason why humanity gives value to this new type of a global trust currency.\nThe council of 9 are over seers, in that the core of the network will be secure and it will not need any major updates. The over seers will all be programmers that I trust and they will follow a manifesto that stipulates many aspects of this new currency that cannot be changed.\nThis network is so advanced compared to modern computers, languages and cryptography that it will be able to run a global financial currency for millenniaÂ’s to come. The language and cryptography will not be open sourced, it will be closed and only the council of 9 will have access to it. The council of 9 has no political or financial agendaÂ’s. They are all computer programmers hand selected by me and are people who I trust. The council of 9 will also be part of a new global nation that will seek to be recognized by the United Nations. This new nation will be open to all citizens of earth. Anyone can join and it has no costs to members. A person merely agrees to belong to it. This new nation will have no taxes and it will treat all of its citizens equally. It exists so it can acquire the land that the 9 quantum servers needs and that land will be exempt from any nation by agreement of the United Nations. The world governing body of humanity known as the United Nations must help this project to come to fruition.\nThe 9 server locations will exist in modern nations that agree to locate these servers in a neutral zone recognized by all members of the United Nations as territory that belongs to no nation and this territory will be governed by this new member nation that has the potential to have inclusion of every person on the planet within it.\nThe current currencies of the world were created by vested interest groups and the power of one nationÂ’s currency over other nations has been used and abused for centuries to enslave most of the world. Today a person that was born into a weak currency nation earns a fraction of what someone born into a more powerful currency nation earns for the same job and same skills. This unjust distribution of money and earnings has created the current global elitist currency monopolies that control most of the worldÂ’s resources and energy.\nThere is now a global manifesto which explains how humanity can create a global free and clean energy network within a generation. I support this concept and it can be found easily by searching for Global Renewable Energy Production Agreement. I support this movement and I am not involved in it, other than having donated some funds to it. This type of free global energy can eliminate all energy monopolies within a generation. Greed corporations such as Google are hiding the manifesto for this organization as they have deleted the old archives of Usenet in regards the ENNISA formula. If you use other search engines you can located the Energy manifesto I have referred to easily. This shows the world how evil Google is in hiding such important information for the world. Do not use or support Google.\nHumanity must take control of its global currency unit and this new network will allow humanity to make that choice. Humanity must force the United Nations to allow for a new member nation to join and it must protect that nation and its people which have no armies. However, this new nation will buy remote pieces of land in remote areas of the planet and on these remote grounds the 9 servers will operate using renewable energy and the existing global network of communication known as the Internet.\nOnly then will the world have a legitimate global currency unit that is free of manipulation and artificial pricing that plagues the original idea I envisioned years ago.\nThere will be only 10 Billion credits issued in this new global network. Each person on the planet will be allocated only one credit. They can use it as they see fit. Any attempt to sell these credits through any exchange is illegal and anyone doing so will have their wallet revoked.\nPeople can agree to do whatever they do as a trade or profession in exchange for whatever fraction of these 10 billion credits that will exist only in consumer wallets. Let the corporations have their worthless fiat and banks that use corrupt digital credits now that centralized governments can create as much as they want.\n10 Billion credits Â is the new currency credit system and they cannot be bought, every person that lives upon this planet will be given 1 full credit in a wallet that is assigned and reserved for every person on the planet. The birth right of every human is to possess an equal share of this new currency system. Every human is entitled to their 1 credit share.\nThis system was designed to give the people of the world a chance to take and hold their rightful asset, an equal value of the worldÂ’s new wealth. If you grow crops, then you can trade your crops for fractions of these credits owned by other people like you. If you teach math, music or art, you can accept fractions of these credits owned by other people like you.\nIf your wallet is connected to any type of exchange trading worthless fiat for your credit, your wallet in the network will be revoked. The system will not allow any exchange or government or business to control the new network and it will not allow any type of exchange to try to set a price as to its value.\nEvery human that exists on the planet has one credit and if you divide it wisely it can last you a lifetime. Likewise, if you begin to accept as payment for whatever you do in life a fraction of these credits, you can acquire something of value that will never be controlled or manipulated by any government or corporation. Every human that is born in the future will be given a free wallet that will contain a tiny fraction of the extra credits the network will have from the 10 Billion credits the network will initially issue, that is all the credits that will ever exist in the network, that being 10 Billion Credits. Approximately 7 Billion humans now exist so the network will have 3 Billion extra credits that can be equally divided for ages to come at the rate of .000000000001 credit per new wallet issued to new humans born after the first genesis wallets are released. So trillions of humans can be born and all of these humans will have a wallet issued with a tiny fraction of one credit. The 3 billion credits not assigned in the original wallet disbursements can last for many thousands of years and fund trillions of new human wallets. Â The first generation of wallet owners funded with a whole credit may allow their wallet to be used to fund the wallets of their heirs. This will promote a desire for all humans to value the credits in their wallets and spend them wisely.\nGovernments are not allowed to hold wallets in this network, but every person in any government as well as every person on the planet has a pre-assigned wallet with only 1 credit in the wallets.\nIf a person finds locally another person that doesnÂ’t want to use their wallet with their 1 credit, an individual may give that person whatever they want for this single credit. If a wallet ever reaches a zero balance, that wallet will be closed and that person will have no way to participate ever again in the network. So you should always maintain at least a tiny fraction of a credit in a wallet.\nThis system of currency was envisioned to give humanity its equal share in the wealth of the world. There will only be 10 Billion Credits issued in the network and they will only be issued 1 Credit at a time to every person on the planet. Companies, Corporations and Governments will have neither credits nor wallets. Let the old system of power have their worthless fiat currencies and banks. So now there exists a new global currency in which every person on the planet has an equal value, everyone starts off with the same equal share of a new currency, for the first time in the history of mankind everyone has an equal share of wealth.\nThis system was envisioned to give the people of the world what their birth right entitles them to, a fair share in the wealth of the planet distributed equally to all people. Let the old worldÂ’s governments and corporations keep their old worthless fiat systems that are mostly digital anyway. They only have worth due to YOU the PEOPLE of the planet thinking they have value or worth.\nThe GLOBAL CREDIT FUND is for the people of the world. Everyone that exists now on the planet has an equal share of this new wealth; it is the wealth of the people of the world. It will exist soon and then you can claim your wallet and use it wisely. You can also use it foolishly and give it away and even sell it for fiat. However, any credits found to be sold on any type of fiat exchange for the credits of the network will end up being revoked by the network. The network is designed for humans to interact locally with each other and trade these rare credits for whatever they do in life. The idea is TO CREATE SOMETHING with your lives, something of VALUE. Right now most of the developed world has lost its path, they create nothing of value, they have no real skill and they do not grow food or teach a real subject that defines the human experience such as music and art.\nRelearn how to grow food, how to create art and how to make music. Use these new global credits to help feed yourself. Give these credits in your mind a value so one credit must last a whole lifetime. What do you need in your local fiat currency to feed yourself for a lifetime or to feed your family? Â In many parts of the world you still grow your own food and you know how to trade in your village amongst your fellow villagers. Modernized nations have lost this skill and they will not survive any major chaos in the weak currency systems they have in place now.\nGrowing your own food and trading it for whatever you need in your village, will ensure you survive in a future where currency chaos is inevitable. The new GLOBAL CREDIT FUND is the first global currency system designed to outlast every currency in existence, yet, I suggest you try to relearn the art of bartering for something YOU GROW or TEACH or CREATE.\nSo think of this new Global Credit Fund as having a value in the future of one million or even ten million of whatever fiat currency you now use. So if you use these credits, a tiny fraction at a time such as .000000000001 the end result is you should be able with such a tiny fraction to do a substantial trade. Perhaps a loaf of bread or a large container of milk or a block of cheese for such a minor fraction to give the world a suggestion as to how they should view this credit in value. The one credit you will soon possess can last a lifetime if you use it wisely. Many will want to sell you food and services for fractions of your one credit. Value it as something that must last a lifetime. Â The world can end hunger by having everyone assigned their wallet with one credit.\nUnfortunately not everyone in the world can now afford even an inexpensive mobile phone to connect to the existing internet, so if you like this new currency concept, I suggest the Supreme Council setup a donation platform so donations can be given to the Council to ensure when the network launches that those without an internet connection can be given a mobile device to connect to the network. Likewise in some areas remote renewable energy centers with internet will need to be set up to ensure that even the poorest people of the world can have access to their one credit and their individual wallet.\n1% of the total credits issued by the network shall be kept in a network wallet for future costs including bandwidth and hardware upgrades. A rolling transaction fee of .01% shall be used for maintenance of the network which shall only be imposed if the network wallet drops below 1% of total credits issued by the network. If the network acquires more than 1% of all credits that are released, then that transaction fee should be rolled back to 0%. The network shall never acquire more than 1% of all credits issued as transactions fees. Transaction fees can be used to replace obsolete equipment of the network.\nSo the first stage of this project will be to have the United Nations recognize the project and the creation of the global nation that anyone can join after it exists can build the 9 quantum servers.\nThen the network can launch and distribute the genesis wallets and credits.\nThen the remote region distribution and network hubs can be installed so all people of the world can participate in the new currency system.\nTo outline this project.\n1. Â  Adoption by United Nations of a new global nation that owns no physical land but will be used for a global credit fund.\n2. Â  Acquire remote land in 9 regions that is then recognized as lands belonging to this new global nation.\n3. Â  Build minor renewable energy plants to fuel the quantum server centers in the 9 regions.\n4. Â  Bring on line the 9 quantum servers and OS that will operate the network. Generate first wave of wallets each containing 1 credit.\n5. Â  Build remote energy centers and internet connections to allow remote peoples of the world to participate in the network.\n", "views": 2580, "author": "1anonymous Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 10 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNakamotos Vision - Is this Satoshi?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-12-01 17:33:33", "content": "No, it's another one of your troll accounts trying to drum up business for your pathetic web ring of fail.\n", "author": "Flashman Hero Member Offline Activity: 518 Merit: 500 Hodl!

I am releasing my GLOBAL CREDIT FUND manifesto below and this thread is the first public release of what I envision as a future global world currency system for the people of this planet. The manifesto puts forth a way to bring equal wealth to everyone on the planet through a new global credit fund in which every person on the planet has an equal share. The project could eliminate world hunger as soon as it is put into use. Â First a few words on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is being abused by those that seek to use it now for profit and power. Do not trust the current people and groups trying to use what I have envisioned.\nDO NOT TRUST\nBitcoin Foundation\nCurrent Version of Bitcoin Core\nThe Bitcoin Core Developers\nGavin\nBitcoin Talk\nNow I shall reveal the manifesto that brings equality in wealth and eliminates world hunger to the world.\nGLOBAL CREDIT FUND MANIFESTO\n12/01/2014\nwww.GlobalCreditFund.org\nA new global currency credit system will soon be launched, it will involve 9 quantum computers located in 9 diverse areas of the planet and there will be only one wallet system to access the network. Every person on the planet will be assigned one wallet for their entire lives and each wallet will be created with no costs and will have only 1 credit in that wallet. The wallet owner may do what they wish with their one credit. They can use it wisely or use it foolishly. Each wallet can receive and send any fraction of credits in their wallet. The 9 quantum servers will be governed by one international body that will be known as the Supreme Council and this council will not have any control or connection to any government or business. The Supreme Council will have 9 council members that I will choose as the first council of the new global currency credit system that I have named today December 1st 2014 the Global Credit Fund.\nThe new cryptography used to operate the Global Credit Fund managed by the Supreme Council is a new generation of cryptography that is necessary due to how all existing cryptography has become corrupted by various groups including the NSA and the organizations they control such as NiST and ENISA which allows these powers that be to decipher all activities that use any form of crypto.\nECC was developed many years ago by Professor Hendrik Lenstra who is connected to intelligence agencies. The idea that any major figure in cryptography is allowed to operate free from any intelligence agency supervision or control is ludicrous. Various other forms of ECC have been created including Koblitz Curves which was created by an NSA spy named professor Neal Koblitz. Neal Koblitz has worked for the NSA since the 1960Â’s when he was a student at Harvard and they funded his long trip to Moscow as an academic.\nIn 1995 the ENNISA document was released to the world via Usenet and I am very familiar with it. Since then, the NSA has tried to delete any mention of the ENNISA document and the ENNISA formula from Usenet archives since it described 30 Mod, 60 Mod and 90 Mod prime algorithms and prime theory. However, if you know where to look, the theory still exists on the net and it can be traced back to 1995 when it was released to destroy all modern cryptography as it has done. Around 2005 a doctoral student of Dr. Lenstra tried to take credit for the 60 Mod prime algorithm described in the 1995 work known as the ENNISA FORMULA Â in a paper he co-authored that is now known as the Sieve of Atkin. The doctoral student of Dr. Lenstra was Daniel Bernstein who did not discover 60 Mod Prime Theory; it was fully formulated in 1995 in the ENNISA FORMULA. It is time to give credit for the amazing prime theories discovered in 1995 to the person that discovered these formulas. The author of the ENNISA FORMULA in 1995 discovered 30 Mod, 60 Mod and 90 Mod prime theories. This is how the NSA has corrupted all modern encryption by understanding these formulas.\nThe person that created it was silenced and discredited by the NSA and Mossad as well as Mi6 since the ENNISA algorithm allows the creation of corrupt seed keys by groups such as the NSA and then the corrupt seed keys are released through NSA controlled organizations such as NiST and ENISA. Â This is what the Snowden documents are trying to reveal to the world, that there is no current cryptography that is secure since for almost twenty years the NSA has held the skeleton keys to modern crypto and that key is the ENNISA FORMULA.\nThe coins mined years ago that created what is now called bitcoin will be used to fund this new global secure network that will be known as the GLOBAL CREDIT FUND and it will operate in the ether of cyber space above the cloud. The servers will use a new form of data load and a new type of crypto involving dimensional math and dimensional computer languages. These new computer languages will be the first generation of AI (Artificial Intelligence) computer languages that will use 36 bit/byte and 90 bit/byte data loads. Modern computers have used binary 8 bit/byte data loads for many decades now and they are obsolete.\nGREED and POWER have destroyed the concept of Bitcoin. The new Global Digital Currency Credit Network will have a set number of credits that will be divisible to 16 decimal places to begin with and then it can expand to any number of decimals that the network needs. Like Bitcoin, this new digital valued credit will promote the deflation of goods as more and more people adopt a trust worthy currency unit that is not controlled by any government or business but only the council of 9. The trust of the people of the world in the new global credit fund will be the reason why humanity gives value to this new type of a global trust currency.\nThe council of 9 are over seers, in that the core of the network will be secure and it will not need any major updates. The over seers will all be programmers that I trust and they will follow a manifesto that stipulates many aspects of this new currency that cannot be changed.\nThis network is so advanced compared to modern computers, languages and cryptography that it will be able to run a global financial currency for millenniaÂ’s to come. The language and cryptography will not be open sourced, it will be closed and only the council of 9 will have access to it. The council of 9 has no political or financial agendaÂ’s. They are all computer programmers hand selected by me and are people who I trust. The council of 9 will also be part of a new global nation that will seek to be recognized by the United Nations. This new nation will be open to all citizens of earth. Anyone can join and it has no costs to members. A person merely agrees to belong to it. This new nation will have no taxes and it will treat all of its citizens equally. It exists so it can acquire the land that the 9 quantum servers needs and that land will be exempt from any nation by agreement of the United Nations. The world governing body of humanity known as the United Nations must help this project to come to fruition.\nThe 9 server locations will exist in modern nations that agree to locate these servers in a neutral zone recognized by all members of the United Nations as territory that belongs to no nation and this territory will be governed by this new member nation that has the potential to have inclusion of every person on the planet within it.\nThe current currencies of the world were created by vested interest groups and the power of one nationÂ’s currency over other nations has been used and abused for centuries to enslave most of the world. Today a person that was born into a weak currency nation earns a fraction of what someone born into a more powerful currency nation earns for the same job and same skills. This unjust distribution of money and earnings has created the current global elitist currency monopolies that control most of the worldÂ’s resources and energy.\nThere is now a global manifesto which explains how humanity can create a global free and clean energy network within a generation. I support this concept and it can be found easily by searching for Global Renewable Energy Production Agreement. I support this movement and I am not involved in it, other than having donated some funds to it. This type of free global energy can eliminate all energy monopolies within a generation. Greed corporations such as Google are hiding the manifesto for this organization as they have deleted the old archives of Usenet in regards the ENNISA formula. If you use other search engines you can located the Energy manifesto I have referred to easily. This shows the world how evil Google is in hiding such important information for the world. Do not use or support Google.\nHumanity must take control of its global currency unit and this new network will allow humanity to make that choice. Humanity must force the United Nations to allow for a new member nation to join and it must protect that nation and its people which have no armies. However, this new nation will buy remote pieces of land in remote areas of the planet and on these remote grounds the 9 servers will operate using renewable energy and the existing global network of communication known as the Internet.\nOnly then will the world have a legitimate global currency unit that is free of manipulation and artificial pricing that plagues the original idea I envisioned years ago.\nThere will be only 10 Billion credits issued in this new global network. Each person on the planet will be allocated only one credit. They can use it as they see fit. Any attempt to sell these credits through any exchange is illegal and anyone doing so will have their wallet revoked.\nPeople can agree to do whatever they do as a trade or profession in exchange for whatever fraction of these 10 billion credits that will exist only in consumer wallets. Let the corporations have their worthless fiat and banks that use corrupt digital credits now that centralized governments can create as much as they want.\n10 Billion credits Â is the new currency credit system and they cannot be bought, every person that lives upon this planet will be given 1 full credit in a wallet that is assigned and reserved for every person on the planet. The birth right of every human is to possess an equal share of this new currency system. Every human is entitled to their 1 credit share.\nThis system was designed to give the people of the world a chance to take and hold their rightful asset, an equal value of the worldÂ’s new wealth. If you grow crops, then you can trade your crops for fractions of these credits owned by other people like you. If you teach math, music or art, you can accept fractions of these credits owned by other people like you.\nIf your wallet is connected to any type of exchange trading worthless fiat for your credit, your wallet in the network will be revoked. The system will not allow any exchange or government or business to control the new network and it will not allow any type of exchange to try to set a price as to its value.\nEvery human that exists on the planet has one credit and if you divide it wisely it can last you a lifetime. Likewise, if you begin to accept as payment for whatever you do in life a fraction of these credits, you can acquire something of value that will never be controlled or manipulated by any government or corporation. Every human that is born in the future will be given a free wallet that will contain a tiny fraction of the extra credits the network will have from the 10 Billion credits the network will initially issue, that is all the credits that will ever exist in the network, that being 10 Billion Credits. Approximately 7 Billion humans now exist so the network will have 3 Billion extra credits that can be equally divided for ages to come at the rate of .000000000001 credit per new wallet issued to new humans born after the first genesis wallets are released. So trillions of humans can be born and all of these humans will have a wallet issued with a tiny fraction of one credit. The 3 billion credits not assigned in the original wallet disbursements can last for many thousands of years and fund trillions of new human wallets. Â The first generation of wallet owners funded with a whole credit may allow their wallet to be used to fund the wallets of their heirs. This will promote a desire for all humans to value the credits in their wallets and spend them wisely.\nGovernments are not allowed to hold wallets in this network, but every person in any government as well as every person on the planet has a pre-assigned wallet with only 1 credit in the wallets.\nIf a person finds locally another person that doesnÂ’t want to use their wallet with their 1 credit, an individual may give that person whatever they want for this single credit. If a wallet ever reaches a zero balance, that wallet will be closed and that person will have no way to participate ever again in the network. So you should always maintain at least a tiny fraction of a credit in a wallet.\nThis system of currency was envisioned to give humanity its equal share in the wealth of the world. There will only be 10 Billion Credits issued in the network and they will only be issued 1 Credit at a time to every person on the planet. Companies, Corporations and Governments will have neither credits nor wallets. Let the old system of power have their worthless fiat currencies and banks.

However, this new nation will buy remote pieces of land in remote areas of the planet and on these remote grounds the 9 servers will operate using renewable energy and the existing global network of communication known as the Internet.\nOnly then will the world have a legitimate global currency unit that is free of manipulation and artificial pricing that plagues the original idea I envisioned years ago.\nThere will be only 10 Billion credits issued in this new global network. Each person on the planet will be allocated only one credit. They can use it as they see fit. Any attempt to sell these credits through any exchange is illegal and anyone doing so will have their wallet revoked.\nPeople can agree to do whatever they do as a trade or profession in exchange for whatever fraction of these 10 billion credits that will exist only in consumer wallets. Let the corporations have their worthless fiat and banks that use corrupt digital credits now that centralized governments can create as much as they want.\n10 Billion credits Â is the new currency credit system and they cannot be bought, every person that lives upon this planet will be given 1 full credit in a wallet that is assigned and reserved for every person on the planet. The birth right of every human is to possess an equal share of this new currency system. Every human is entitled to their 1 credit share.\nThis system was designed to give the people of the world a chance to take and hold their rightful asset, an equal value of the worldÂ’s new wealth. If you grow crops, then you can trade your crops for fractions of these credits owned by other people like you. If you teach math, music or art, you can accept fractions of these credits owned by other people like you.\nIf your wallet is connected to any type of exchange trading worthless fiat for your credit, your wallet in the network will be revoked. The system will not allow any exchange or government or business to control the new network and it will not allow any type of exchange to try to set a price as to its value.\nEvery human that exists on the planet has one credit and if you divide it wisely it can last you a lifetime. Likewise, if you begin to accept as payment for whatever you do in life a fraction of these credits, you can acquire something of value that will never be controlled or manipulated by any government or corporation. Every human that is born in the future will be given a free wallet that will contain a tiny fraction of the extra credits the network will have from the 10 Billion credits the network will initially issue, that is all the credits that will ever exist in the network, that being 10 Billion Credits. Approximately 7 Billion humans now exist so the network will have 3 Billion extra credits that can be equally divided for ages to come at the rate of .000000000001 credit per new wallet issued to new humans born after the first genesis wallets are released. So trillions of humans can be born and all of these humans will have a wallet issued with a tiny fraction of one credit. The 3 billion credits not assigned in the original wallet disbursements can last for many thousands of years and fund trillions of new human wallets. Â The first generation of wallet owners funded with a whole credit may allow their wallet to be used to fund the wallets of their heirs. This will promote a desire for all humans to value the credits in their wallets and spend them wisely.\nGovernments are not allowed to hold wallets in this network, but every person in any government as well as every person on the planet has a pre-assigned wallet with only 1 credit in the wallets.\nIf a person finds locally another person that doesnÂ’t want to use their wallet with their 1 credit, an individual may give that person whatever they want for this single credit. If a wallet ever reaches a zero balance, that wallet will be closed and that person will have no way to participate ever again in the network. So you should always maintain at least a tiny fraction of a credit in a wallet.\nThis system of currency was envisioned to give humanity its equal share in the wealth of the world. There will only be 10 Billion Credits issued in the network and they will only be issued 1 Credit at a time to every person on the planet. Companies, Corporations and Governments will have neither credits nor wallets. Let the old system of power have their worthless fiat currencies and banks. So now there exists a new global currency in which every person on the planet has an equal value, everyone starts off with the same equal share of a new currency, for the first time in the history of mankind everyone has an equal share of wealth.\nThis system was envisioned to give the people of the world what their birth right entitles them to, a fair share in the wealth of the planet distributed equally to all people. Let the old worldÂ’s governments and corporations keep their old worthless fiat systems that are mostly digital anyway. They only have worth due to YOU the PEOPLE of the planet thinking they have value or worth.\nThe GLOBAL CREDIT FUND is for the people of the world. Everyone that exists now on the planet has an equal share of this new wealth; it is the wealth of the people of the world. It will exist soon and then you can claim your wallet and use it wisely. You can also use it foolishly and give it away and even sell it for fiat. However, any credits found to be sold on any type of fiat exchange for the credits of the network will end up being revoked by the network. The network is designed for humans to interact locally with each other and trade these rare credits for whatever they do in life. The idea is TO CREATE SOMETHING with your lives, something of VALUE. Right now most of the developed world has lost its path, they create nothing of value, they have no real skill and they do not grow food or teach a real subject that defines the human experience such as music and art.\nRelearn how to grow food, how to create art and how to make music. Use these new global credits to help feed yourself. Give these credits in your mind a value so one credit must last a whole lifetime. What do you need in your local fiat currency to feed yourself for a lifetime or to feed your family? Â In many parts of the world you still grow your own food and you know how to trade in your village amongst your fellow villagers. Modernized nations have lost this skill and they will not survive any major chaos in the weak currency systems they have in place now.\nGrowing your own food and trading it for whatever you need in your village, will ensure you survive in a future where currency chaos is inevitable. The new GLOBAL CREDIT FUND is the first global currency system designed to outlast every currency in existence, yet, I suggest you try to relearn the art of bartering for something YOU GROW or TEACH or CREATE.\nSo think of this new Global Credit Fund as having a value in the future of one million or even ten million of whatever fiat currency you now use. So if you use these credits, a tiny fraction at a time such as .000000000001 the end result is you should be able with such a tiny fraction to do a substantial trade. Perhaps a loaf of bread or a large container of milk or a block of cheese for such a minor fraction to give the world a suggestion as to how they should view this credit in value. The one credit you will soon possess can last a lifetime if you use it wisely. Many will want to sell you food and services for fractions of your one credit. Value it as something that must last a lifetime. Â The world can end hunger by having everyone assigned their wallet with one credit.\nUnfortunately not everyone in the world can now afford even an inexpensive mobile phone to connect to the existing internet, so if you like this new currency concept, I suggest the Supreme Council setup a donation platform so donations can be given to the Council to ensure when the network launches that those without an internet connection can be given a mobile device to connect to the network. Likewise in some areas remote renewable energy centers with internet will need to be set up to ensure that even the poorest people of the world can have access to their one credit and their individual wallet.\n1% of the total credits issued by the network shall be kept in a network wallet for future costs including bandwidth and hardware upgrades. A rolling transaction fee of .01% shall be used for maintenance of the network which shall only be imposed if the network wallet drops below 1% of total credits issued by the network. If the network acquires more than 1% of all credits that are released, then that transaction fee should be rolled back to 0%. The network shall never acquire more than 1% of all credits issued as transactions fees. Transaction fees can be used to replace obsolete equipment of the network.\nSo the first stage of this project will be to have the United Nations recognize the project and the creation of the global nation that anyone can join after it exists can build the 9 quantum servers.\nThen the network can launch and distribute the genesis wallets and credits.\nThen the remote region distribution and network hubs can be installed so all people of the world can participate in the new currency system.\nTo outline this project.\n1. Â  Adoption by United Nations of a new global nation that owns no physical land but will be used for a global credit fund.\n2. Â  Acquire remote land in 9 regions that is then recognized as lands belonging to this new global nation.\n3. Â  Build minor renewable energy plants to fuel the quantum server centers in the 9 regions.\n4. Â  Bring on line the 9 quantum servers and OS that will operate the network. Generate first wave of wallets each containing 1 credit.\n5. Â  Build remote energy centers and internet connections to allow remote peoples of the world to participate in the network.\n", "author": "1anonymous Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-12-01 18:19:06", "content": "\"A new global currency credit system will soon be launched, it will involve 9 quantum computers located in 9 diverse areas of the planet and there will be only one wallet system to access the network\"\nmaybe Josh from gawminer\n- next scam\n", "author": "LiteCoinGuy Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1001 In Satoshi I Trust "}, {"date": "2014-12-01 18:48:09", "content": "Rubbish.\n", "author": "jehst Hero Member Offline Activity: 798 Merit: 1000 21 million.

Renewable energy to fuel the super computers.\n5. .01% transactions fees with a max of 1% to the network to pay for new equipment and bandwidth\n6. Free smart phones and building of local hubs in poor areas to allow the poor access to their 1 credit\n7. Example of how to value a credit .000000000001 for a loaf of bread, good example.\n8. A council of 9 govern the project and have no corporate or political ties\n9. No wallets for governments, let them all choke on their old fiat\n10. No wallets for companies or corporations to destroy greed\nIt's a well thought out manifesto as far as manifesto's go\nI could see if some group set up a wind mill in some remote African village with a way to grab a net food from a satellite and gave the villagers free smart phones with preloaded 1 credits in a wallet to the network that the villagers may actually start to use technology and embrace a global credit system. Then big companies move into to acquire the poor peoples credit. Then the network revokes the wallet that some greed merchant used to acquire credits illegally.\nSo it could be something that many embrace quickly, all they need to do is launch a wallet now with 1 credit in it for people to use now, without even poor people and many will take it, and if some sites exist to buy say music or books, it could take off. Then exchanges follow and if the manifesto is serious, any wallets caught trading in fiat for the credits are revoked.\nSo getting people to download free wallets preloaded could happen very soon and it could grow virally, since btc has a problem with people getting btc into their wallets.\nI'm not so sure how advanced their crypto is, and if you need a super network to do it now, but right now someone could take this concept and create a wallet preloaded and if the wallet can be properly tracked so everyone can get one it may work.\nI see huge issues with wallet distribution, if it's IP based, ok you can get lots of wallets by banging ips, so wallet distribution is the key.\nThen if the network really monitors flow of credits, they are the ultimate power to decide who moved too many credits to one wallet or a group of wallets. So an advanced wallet would be needed to limit them to one user. Doesn't look like it could be done anonymously, but it could be done to do an equal wealth project.\nHere's 1 credit for everyone on the planet, use it wisely, they get wallets into millions of peoples hands for whatever they tied it to, maybe some rock stars new song, and bingo, you have overnight millions of wallets with 1 credit each.\nMaybe the rock star artist takes .00000000001 credit for a song or album.\nSo this could spread fast by just having one major musician say let's feed the poor.\nThe only thing that won't let this thing happen is if people don't want a free wallet with a credit in it. If they can buy something of value with that credit, it could be a viral digital currency very fast.\nThe aspect of feeding poor people is noble and it could hook a celebrity to break it globally.\n", "author": "1anonymous Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-12-01 19:48:31", "content": "Who is in the supreme council?\nSounds like some kind of empire vs rebel alliance scenario.

So overnight they could make everyone on the planet a millionaire.\nBottom line is it's a manifesto to put millions or billions of crypto wallets into users smartphones where the first credit costs them nothing.\nSo then what will people trade for some of that 1 credit.\nI personally like the concept of 10 billion credits and credits not coins\n100M to the network and 7 billion to people for free, if they have a few sites with stuff for .000001 fractions like music and books it could take off fast.\nWhat is the biggest obstacle to bitcoin, getting it into wallets, right now people have to give up a ton of info to 3rd parties that then control exchanges.\nThis eliminates all that and outlaws exchanges.\nIt's brilliant IMO, but time will tell if it's real or who knows what it is.\n", "author": "1anonymous Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-12-01 20:43:21", "content": "Satoshi now is greedy cuz he didnt win enough with btc.\n", "author": "BGkockata Member Offline Activity: 70 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-12-01 20:44:30", "content": "Sounds like crytocurrency for communism.

So programmers are starting to build things on top of the block chain that have nothing to do with digital currency.\nFor instance, some programmers have developed a protocol called La'Zooz for real-time ride sharing. That could eventually disrupt Uber. Others have created OpenBazaar, a protocol for a peer-to-peer trading network that could disrupt eBay. Both use the block chain for some basic computing tasks.\nHere's a simple way of thinking about it. The block chain itself is immutable, like bedrock. Bitcoin is like a building on top of that bedrock Â— it has a foundation on which programmers have defined some of the basics of how it works, then a bunch of stories on top of that in which people interact with it.\nRead more:\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/how-bitcoin-could-change-everything-not-just-finance-2014-12#ixzz3KkANKMnD\n", "views": 1063, "author": "sonofacoin Member Offline Activity: 78 Merit: 10 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis Investor Thinks Bitcoin Will Change EVERYTHING Â— Not Just Finance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-12-02 12:49:48", "content": "Just wait and see what happens when SideChains hit the mainnet ...\nYou should also look up trade-net, good video here :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu4PAMFPo5Y\n(very forward blue sky thinking but it shows you the opportunities the block chain brings)\n", "author": "dasource Hero Member Offline Activity: 823 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-12-02 14:49:04", "content": "BTC is just a foundation.

Zimmerman felt a need to create something that would give users an outlet for information confidentiality in an age where increasing threats of privacy invasion meant online communications were subject to prying eyes of government authority. These authorities were overstepping their boundaries of legal jurisdiction and attempting to exercise coercion in a domain where their actions came at the cost of information freedom. Originally designed as a human rights tool, the software encryption came to be published under an open-source license and adopted as an IETF standard. This software would be called Â’Pretty Good PrivacyÂ’, or PGP for short.\nThe publishing of the PGP software landed Zimmerman in a three-year criminal investigation by the US Government, who classified the encryption as military-grade weaponry. As they claimed, the distribution of source code represented a Â“munitions export without licenceÂ”. During this time, encryption procedures which comprised keys larger than 40 bits were categorized as munitions under the US export regulations. The smallest keys PGP used were 128 bits, thus at the time they fit within the legal definition of munitions. If convicted, the penalties for violation were substantial.\nYears before the government had placed encryption, a method for scrambling messages so they can only be understood by their intended recipients, on the United States Munitions List, alongside bombs and flamethrowers, as a weapon to be regulated for national security purposes. Companies and individuals exporting items on the munitions list, including software with encryption capabilities, had to obtain prior State Department approval.\nÂ—Electronic Frontier Foundation: EFFÂ’s History\nZimmerman argued the case in a creative manner, publishing the entirety of the source code in a physical book, relying on the principle that weapons, bombs, and software may restricted goods and were justly under the regulation of the state. Books however, were protected under first amendment rights. In early 1996 the case was closed with no charges lain against Zimmerman or any subsequent party. Since that time, PGP has gone on to become the most widely used and trusted email encryption.\nEconomic Munitions\nIn the same way which PGP was originally classified as a sort of weapon, could bitcoin as well be seen as a type of munitions? Given that bitcoin is based upon the same public key cryptography that PGP originally was, and that a representation of a bitcoin key pair contains 512 bits of data, could it then be argued that bitcoin is nothing more than an exercise in the practice of mathematics, and if so, could it be reasonable to view bitcoin as free speech?\nRead the full article\nhere\n.\nAs an aside, I will also mention we are looking for writers who can dive into some of the more interesting/advanced topics of bitcoin.

He's a great guy and PGP was a wonderful little program. For a while I was on the PGP International development team. In fact, I still use PGP.\nToo bad that nowadays it has been mostly replaced by GnuPG, which is a humongous pile of crap, full of bugs and incompatibilities.\nIn fact, the latest version of it completely dropped support for PGP 2.x - meaning that you simply can no longer use GnuPG to communicate with a PGP 2.x user. (Before it was only impossible to sign-only for a PGP 2.x user and sign-and-encrypt was horrendously awkward and needed 5 different commands.)\nI don't think that Phil used the \"free speech\" argument. He mostly used the \"I've never broken the law\" argument - i.e., that he never exported PGP (the program) from the USA without a license. He did, however, publish its source in a book, using a special OCR-friendly font. The book was then scanned outside the USA and the result was the basis of the PGP International version. But this was done after a grand jury investigation was launched against Phil. He was never indicted, which suggests that the grand jury never found any evidence for illegal activities from his part.\nThe \"free speech\" argument was used by somebody else, although I can't remember his name right now. He printed on a T-shirt the source of a Perl program that did basic encryption and crossed the US border while wearing it, claiming that it was his 1st amendment right to do so. Although he was harassed several times, I don't think that he was ever indicted of any wrongdoing, either.\nFinally, there was another funny case. At that time, because of the silly US export law, Unix machines were exported without the code for the crypt(1) program. However, they still contained some cryptographic code necessary to hash the passwords. Another cryptographer (Peter Gutmann, I think; another friend of mine) proved the equivalence between encryption and hashing (i.e., if you have a cryptographically secure hash function, it is possible to construct a cipher based on it, and if you have a cipher, you can use it to produce cryptographically strong hashes) and used the Unix functions for password hashing to produce an encryption program.\nAh, those were the days... (Gosh, I feel old...)\nTo return to your question, I don't see much sense in it. First of all, it is only governments that \"classify\" thins like that. To the best of my knowledge, no government has classified Bitcoin as munitions. Besides, Bitcoin is based in signing and hashing and although that's equivalent to encryption in a mathematical sense, no government is smart enough to make the connection and classify it as encryption. Finally, only certain kinds of things can be classified as free speech. The source of Bitcoin core (or any other program) is certainly free speech. Bitcoin itself is not, just as the number on a US dollar banknote isn't. Finally, by far not all countries recognize the concept of \"free speech\" (let alone have it embedded in their constitution), while Bitcoin is international and knows no borders.\n", "author": "Vessko Full Member Offline Activity: 139 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-11-27 18:52:54", "content": "I don't see how you make the connection between PGP and bitcoin.

This resulted in companies potentially getting \"stuck\" in their design process as they may have been able to get close to the efficiency goals, but were not good enough to ship to customers that were expecting better results.

Along wiht other replies in ths thread a few thigs are going on, pre0order has burnt out and can nt be used. the scammer have seized the day on that situation fully, now with the current difficulty to the income ratio, it is not profitable to mine Bitcoins in roughly 42% of the world. Places like where I live for instance, the electric rates are already 2 times as much as places like CAnada and USA, thent he landlords add another amount onto each KWH you use making your electricity rates actually 3 times the amount of USA and Canada, this equals NOT PROFITABLE TO MINE. once that percentage hits 60% of the world the plans that are inn motio will be released. if you honslty think the tru good Bitcoin manufactures are just sitting on their ass waiting to sell what they have left in invitory you are so misguided. they have no inventory, they are like a viper they have thier plan they are just sitting waiting for the time to strike.

It outlines a global network and how the UN needs to support it and how the poor must be given free access to their global credit. It names a lot of crypto guys and trashes them. It discusses a lot of number theories and how some academics he names stole someone's work. It has quantum computers and AI and a whole new type of crypto using 90 bit byte technology. Our current data loads is as he mentions only 8 bit bytes. Sounds like a futuristic global command center involving the United Nations and how it will end world hunger.\nEDIT\nSince reddit erased it, I'm putting it here. I think it's a historical manifesto since it puts forth a clear way to end world hunger.\n______________________\nThis is my official thread about what I envisioned many years ago that the world now calls Bitcoin. I am releasing my GLOBAL CREDIT FUND manifesto below and this thread is the first public release of what I envision as a future global world currency system for the people of this planet. The manifesto puts forth a way to bring equal wealth to everyone on the planet through a new global credit fund in which every person on the planet has an equal share. The project could eliminate world hunger as soon as it is put into use. Â First a few words on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is being abused by those that seek to use it now for profit and power. Do not trust the current people and groups trying to use what I have envisioned.\nDO NOT TRUST\nBitcoin Foundation\nCurrent Version of Bitcoin Core\nThe Bitcoin Core Developers\nGavin\nBitcoin Talk\nNow I shall reveal the manifesto that brings equality in wealth and eliminates world hunger to the world.\nGLOBAL CREDIT FUND MANIFESTO\n12/01/2014\nwww.GlobalCreditFund.org\nA new global currency credit system will soon be launched, it will involve 9 quantum computers located in 9 diverse areas of the planet and there will be only one wallet system to access the network. Every person on the planet will be assigned one wallet for their entire lives and each wallet will be created with no costs and will have only 1 credit in that wallet. The wallet owner may do what they wish with their one credit. They can use it wisely or use it foolishly. Each wallet can receive and send any fraction of credits in their wallet. The 9 quantum servers will be governed by one international body that will be known as the Supreme Council and this council will not have any control or connection to any government or business. The Supreme Council will have 9 council members that I will choose as the first council of the new global currency credit system that I have named today December 1st 2014 the Global Credit Fund.\nThe new cryptography used to operate the Global Credit Fund managed by the Supreme Council is a new generation of cryptography that is necessary due to how all existing cryptography has become corrupted by various groups including the NSA and the organizations they control such as NiST and ENISA which allows these powers that be to decipher all activities that use any form of crypto.\nECC was developed many years ago by Professor Hendrik Lenstra who is connected to intelligence agencies. The idea that any major figure in cryptography is allowed to operate free from any intelligence agency supervision or control is ludicrous. Various other forms of ECC have been created including Koblitz Curves which was created by an NSA spy named professor Neal Koblitz. Neal Koblitz has worked for the NSA since the 1960Â’s when he was a student at Harvard and they funded his long trip to Moscow as an academic.\nIn 1995 the ENNISA document was released to the world via Usenet and I am very familiar with it. Since then, the NSA has tried to delete any mention of the ENNISA document and the ENNISA formula from Usenet archives since it described 30 Mod, 60 Mod and 90 Mod prime algorithms and prime theory. However, if you know where to look, the theory still exists on the net and it can be traced back to 1995 when it was released to destroy all modern cryptography as it has done. Around 2005 a doctoral student of Dr. Lenstra tried to take credit for the 60 Mod prime algorithm described in the 1995 work known as the ENNISA FORMULA Â in a paper he co-authored that is now known as the Sieve of Atkin. The doctoral student of Dr. Lenstra was Daniel Bernstein who did not discover 60 Mod Prime Theory; it was fully formulated in 1995 in the ENNISA FORMULA. It is time to give credit for the amazing prime theories discovered in 1995 to the person that discovered these formulas. The author of the ENNISA FORMULA in 1995 discovered 30 Mod, 60 Mod and 90 Mod prime theories. This is how the NSA has corrupted all modern encryption by understanding these formulas.\nThe person that created it was silenced and discredited by the NSA and Mossad as well as Mi6 since the ENNISA algorithm allows the creation of corrupt seed keys by groups such as the NSA and then the corrupt seed keys are released through NSA controlled organizations such as NiST and ENISA. Â This is what the Snowden documents are trying to reveal to the world, that there is no current cryptography that is secure since for almost twenty years the NSA has held the skeleton keys to modern crypto and that key is the ENNISA FORMULA.\nThe coins mined years ago that created what is now called bitcoin will be used to fund this new global secure network that will be known as the GLOBAL CREDIT FUND and it will operate in the ether of cyber space above the cloud. The servers will use a new form of data load and a new type of crypto involving dimensional math and dimensional computer languages. These new computer languages will be the first generation of AI (Artificial Intelligence) computer languages that will use 36 bit/byte and 90 bit/byte data loads. Modern computers have used binary 8 bit/byte data loads for many decades now and they are obsolete.\nGREED and POWER have destroyed the concept of Bitcoin. The new Global Digital Currency Credit Network will have a set number of credits that will be divisible to 16 decimal places to begin with and then it can expand to any number of decimals that the network needs. Like Bitcoin, this new digital valued credit will promote the deflation of goods as more and more people adopt a trust worthy currency unit that is not controlled by any government or business but only the council of 9. The trust of the people of the world in the new global credit fund will be the reason why humanity gives value to this new type of a global trust currency.\nThe council of 9 are over seers, in that the core of the network will be secure and it will not need any major updates. The over seers will all be programmers that I trust and they will follow a manifesto that stipulates many aspects of this new currency that cannot be changed.\nThis network is so advanced compared to modern computers, languages and cryptography that it will be able to run a global financial currency for millenniaÂ’s to come. The language and cryptography will not be open sourced, it will be closed and only the council of 9 will have access to it. The council of 9 has no political or financial agendaÂ’s. They are all computer programmers hand selected by me and are people who I trust. The council of 9 will also be part of a new global nation that will seek to be recognized by the United Nations. This new nation will be open to all citizens of earth. Anyone can join and it has no costs to members. A person merely agrees to belong to it. This new nation will have no taxes and it will treat all of its citizens equally. It exists so it can acquire the land that the 9 quantum servers needs and that land will be exempt from any nation by agreement of the United Nations. The world governing body of humanity known as the United Nations must help this project to come to fruition.\nThe 9 server locations will exist in modern nations that agree to locate these servers in a neutral zone recognized by all members of the United Nations as territory that belongs to no nation and this territory will be governed by this new member nation that has the potential to have inclusion of every person on the planet within it.\nThe current currencies of the world were created by vested interest groups and the power of one nationÂ’s currency over other nations has been used and abused for centuries to enslave most of the world. Today a person that was born into a weak currency nation earns a fraction of what someone born into a more powerful currency nation earns for the same job and same skills. This unjust distribution of money and earnings has created the current global elitist currency monopolies that control most of the worldÂ’s resources and energy.\nThere is now a global manifesto which explains how humanity can create a global free and clean energy network within a generation. I support this concept and it can be found easily by searching for Global Renewable Energy Production Agreement. I support this movement and I am not involved in it, other than having donated some funds to it. This type of free global energy can eliminate all energy monopolies within a generation. Greed corporations such as Google are hiding the manifesto for this organization as they have deleted the old archives of Usenet in regards the ENNISA formula. If you use other search engines you can located the Energy manifesto I have referred to easily. This shows the world how evil Google is in hiding such important information for the world. Do not use or support Google.\nHumanity must take control of its global currency unit and this new network will allow humanity to make that choice. Humanity must force the United Nations to allow for a new member nation to join and it must protect that nation and its people which have no armies. However, this new nation will buy remote pieces of land in remote areas of the planet and on these remote grounds the 9 servers will operate using renewable energy and the existing global network of communication known as the Internet.\nOnly then will the world have a legitimate global currency unit that is free of manipulation and artificial pricing that plagues the original idea I envisioned years ago.\nThere will be only 10 Billion credits issued in this new global network. Each person on the planet will be allocated only one credit. They can use it as they see fit. Any attempt to sell these credits through any exchange is illegal and anyone doing so will have their wallet revoked.\nPeople can agree to do whatever they do as a trade or profession in exchange for whatever fraction of these 10 billion credits that will exist only in consumer wallets. Let the corporations have their worthless fiat and banks that use corrupt digital credits now that centralized governments can create as much as they want.\n10 Billion credits Â is the new currency credit system and they cannot be bought, every person that lives upon this planet will be given 1 full credit in a wallet that is assigned and reserved for every person on the planet. The birth right of every human is to possess an equal share of this new currency system. Every human is entitled to their 1 credit share.\nThis system was designed to give the people of the world a chance to take and hold their rightful asset, an equal value of the worldÂ’s new wealth. If you grow crops, then you can trade your crops for fractions of these credits owned by other people like you. If you teach math, music or art, you can accept fractions of these credits owned by other people like you.\nIf your wallet is connected to any type of exchange trading worthless fiat for your credit, your wallet in the network will be revoked. The system will not allow any exchange or government or business to control the new network and it will not allow any type of exchange to try to set a price as to its value.\nEvery human that exists on the planet has one credit and if you divide it wisely it can last you a lifetime. Likewise, if you begin to accept as payment for whatever you do in life a fraction of these credits, you can acquire something of value that will never be controlled or manipulated by any government or corporation. Every human that is born in the future will be given a free wallet that will contain a tiny fraction of the extra credits the network will have from the 10 Billion credits the network will initially issue, that is all the credits that will ever exist in the network, that being 10 Billion Credits. Approximately 7 Billion humans now exist so the network will have 3 Billion extra credits that can be equally divided for ages to come at the rate of .000000000001 credit per new wallet issued to new humans born after the first genesis wallets are released. So trillions of humans can be born and all of these humans will have a wallet issued with a tiny fraction of one credit. The 3 billion credits not assigned in the original wallet disbursements can last for many thousands of years and fund trillions of new human wallets. Â The first generation of wallet owners funded with a whole credit may allow their wallet to be used to fund the wallets of their heirs. This will promote a desire for all humans to value the credits in their wallets and spend them wisely.\nGovernments are not allowed to hold wallets in this network, but every person in any government as well as every person on the planet has a pre-assigned wallet with only 1 credit in the wallets.\nIf a person finds locally another person that doesnÂ’t want to use their wallet with their 1 credit, an individual may give that person whatever they want for this single credit. If a wallet ever reaches a zero balance, that wallet will be closed and that person will have no way to participate ever again in the network. So you should always maintain at least a tiny fraction of a credit in a wallet.\nThis system of currency was envisioned to give humanity its equal share in the wealth of the world. There will only be 10 Billion Credits issued in the network and they will only be issued 1 Credit at a time to every person on the planet. Companies, Corporations and Governments will have neither credits nor wallets. Let the old system of power have their worthless fiat currencies and banks. So now there exists a new global currency in which every person on the planet has an equal value, everyone starts off with the same equal share of a new currency, for the first time in the history of mankind everyone has an equal share of wealth.\nThis system was envisioned to give the people of the world what their birth right entitles them to, a fair share in the wealth of the planet distributed equally to all people. Let the old worldÂ’s governments and corporations keep their old worthless fiat systems that are mostly digital anyway. They only have worth due to YOU the PEOPLE of the planet thinking they have value or worth.\nThe GLOBAL CREDIT FUND is for the people of the world. Everyone that exists now on the planet has an equal share of this new wealth; it is the wealth of the people of the world. It will exist soon and then you can claim your wallet and use it wisely. You can also use it foolishly and give it away and even sell it for fiat. However, any credits found to be sold on any type of fiat exchange for the credits of the network will end up being revoked by the network. The network is designed for humans to interact locally with each other and trade these rare credits for whatever they do in life. The idea is TO CREATE SOMETHING with your lives, something of VALUE. Right now most of the developed world has lost its path, they create nothing of value, they have no real skill and they do not grow food or teach a real subject that defines the human experience such as music and art.\nRelearn how to grow food, how to create art and how to make music. Use these new global credits to help feed yourself. Give these credits in your mind a value so one credit must last a whole lifetime. What do you need in your local fiat currency to feed yourself for a lifetime or to feed your family? Â In many parts of the world you still grow your own food and you know how to trade in your village amongst your fellow villagers. Modernized nations have lost this skill and they will not survive any major chaos in the weak currency systems they have in place now.\nGrowing your own food and trading it for whatever you need in your village, will ensure you survive in a future where currency chaos is inevitable. The new GLOBAL CREDIT FUND is the first global currency system designed to outlast every currency in existence, yet, I suggest you try to relearn the art of bartering for something YOU GROW or TEACH or CREATE.\nSo think of this new Global Credit Fund as having a value in the future of one million or even ten million of whatever fiat currency you now use. So if you use these credits, a tiny fraction at a time such as .000000000001 the end result is you should be able with such a tiny fraction to do a substantial trade. Perhaps a loaf of bread or a large container of milk or a block of cheese for such a minor fraction to give the world a suggestion as to how they should view this credit in value. The one credit you will soon possess can last a lifetime if you use it wisely. Many will want to sell you food and services for fractions of your one credit. Value it as something that must last a lifetime. Â The world can end hunger by having everyone assigned their wallet with one credit.\nUnfortunately not everyone in the world can now afford even an inexpensive mobile phone to connect to the existing internet, so if you like this new currency concept, I suggest the Supreme Council setup a donation platform so donations can be given to the Council to ensure when the network launches that those without an internet connection can be given a mobile device to connect to the network. Likewise in some areas remote renewable energy centers with internet will need to be set up to ensure that even the poorest people of the world can have access to their one credit and their individual wallet.\n1% of the total credits issued by the network shall be kept in a network wallet for future costs including bandwidth and hardware upgrades. A rolling transaction fee of .01% shall be used for maintenance of the network which shall only be imposed if the network wallet drops below 1% of total credits issued by the network. If the network acquires more than 1% of all credits that are released, then that transaction fee should be rolled back to 0%. The network shall never acquire more than 1% of all credits issued as transactions fees. Transaction fees can be used to replace obsolete equipment of the network.\nSo the first stage of this project will be to have the United Nations recognize the project and the creation of the global nation that anyone can join after it exists can build the 9 quantum servers.\nThen the network can launch and distribute the genesis wallets and credits.\nThen the remote region distribution and network hubs can be installed so all people of the world can participate in the new currency system.\nTo outline this project.\n1. Â  Adoption by United Nations of a new global nation that owns no physical land but will be used for a global credit fund.\n2. Â  Acquire remote land in 9 regions that is then recognized as lands belonging to this new global nation.\n3. Â  Build minor renewable energy plants to fuel the quantum server centers in the 9 regions.\n4. Â  Bring on line the 9 quantum servers and OS that will operate the network. Generate first wave of wallets each containing 1 credit.\n5. Â  Build remote energy centers and internet connections to allow remote peoples of the world to participate in the network.\n", "views": 2580, "author": "1anonymous Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 10 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNakamotos Vision - Is this Satoshi?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-12-01 17:33:33", "content": "No, it's another one of your troll accounts trying to drum up business for your pathetic web ring of fail.\n", "author": "Flashman Hero Member Offline Activity: 518 Merit: 500 Hodl!

Right now most of the developed world has lost its path, they create nothing of value, they have no real skill and they do not grow food or teach a real subject that defines the human experience such as music and art.\nRelearn how to grow food, how to create art and how to make music. Use these new global credits to help feed yourself. Give these credits in your mind a value so one credit must last a whole lifetime. What do you need in your local fiat currency to feed yourself for a lifetime or to feed your family? Â In many parts of the world you still grow your own food and you know how to trade in your village amongst your fellow villagers. Modernized nations have lost this skill and they will not survive any major chaos in the weak currency systems they have in place now.\nGrowing your own food and trading it for whatever you need in your village, will ensure you survive in a future where currency chaos is inevitable. The new GLOBAL CREDIT FUND is the first global currency system designed to outlast every currency in existence, yet, I suggest you try to relearn the art of bartering for something YOU GROW or TEACH or CREATE.\nSo think of this new Global Credit Fund as having a value in the future of one million or even ten million of whatever fiat currency you now use. So if you use these credits, a tiny fraction at a time such as .000000000001 the end result is you should be able with such a tiny fraction to do a substantial trade. Perhaps a loaf of bread or a large container of milk or a block of cheese for such a minor fraction to give the world a suggestion as to how they should view this credit in value. The one credit you will soon possess can last a lifetime if you use it wisely. Many will want to sell you food and services for fractions of your one credit. Value it as something that must last a lifetime. Â The world can end hunger by having everyone assigned their wallet with one credit.\nUnfortunately not everyone in the world can now afford even an inexpensive mobile phone to connect to the existing internet, so if you like this new currency concept, I suggest the Supreme Council setup a donation platform so donations can be given to the Council to ensure when the network launches that those without an internet connection can be given a mobile device to connect to the network. Likewise in some areas remote renewable energy centers with internet will need to be set up to ensure that even the poorest people of the world can have access to their one credit and their individual wallet.\n1% of the total credits issued by the network shall be kept in a network wallet for future costs including bandwidth and hardware upgrades. A rolling transaction fee of .01% shall be used for maintenance of the network which shall only be imposed if the network wallet drops below 1% of total credits issued by the network. If the network acquires more than 1% of all credits that are released, then that transaction fee should be rolled back to 0%. The network shall never acquire more than 1% of all credits issued as transactions fees. Transaction fees can be used to replace obsolete equipment of the network.\nSo the first stage of this project will be to have the United Nations recognize the project and the creation of the global nation that anyone can join after it exists can build the 9 quantum servers.\nThen the network can launch and distribute the genesis wallets and credits.\nThen the remote region distribution and network hubs can be installed so all people of the world can participate in the new currency system.\nTo outline this project.\n1. Â  Adoption by United Nations of a new global nation that owns no physical land but will be used for a global credit fund.\n2. Â  Acquire remote land in 9 regions that is then recognized as lands belonging to this new global nation.\n3. Â  Build minor renewable energy plants to fuel the quantum server centers in the 9 regions.\n4. Â  Bring on line the 9 quantum servers and OS that will operate the network. Generate first wave of wallets each containing 1 credit.\n5. Â  Build remote energy centers and internet connections to allow remote peoples of the world to participate in the network.\n", "author": "1anonymous Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-12-01 17:41:28", "content": "Seems reddit has removed this historical manifesto to end world hunger, so it is now preserved at\nhttp://1anonymous.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=17&amp;p=17#p17\nThe manifesto has a domain that isn't resolving, so I guess it will be put up on that site which is\nwww.GlobalCreditFund.org\nCopy and paste the manifesto so this idea can spread to end hunger\nQuit trying to promote your site.\n", "author": "kingcolex Legendary Online Activity: 1596 Merit: 1007 Anonymous bitcoin mixer "}, {"date": "2014-12-01 17:43:07", "content": "No, it's another one of your troll accounts trying to drum up business for your pathetic web ring of fail.\nLOL\nSo true...\n", "author": "pedrog Legendary Offline Activity: 1918 Merit: 1005 "}, {"date": "2014-12-01 17:47:28", "content": "This is what Reddit erased\nI could care less about traffic\nDiscuss if you want\nPut it where you want on any site\nI could care less about traffic to my own site, but I think this is a worthy manifesto, it makes the Bitcoin paper look primitive.\nHere is what reddit deleted\nPoster used the name NAKAMOTOS\n_________________________________\n______________________\nThis is my official thread about what I envisioned many years ago that the world now calls Bitcoin. I am releasing my GLOBAL CREDIT FUND manifesto below and this thread is the first public release of what I envision as a future global world currency system for the people of this planet. The manifesto puts forth a way to bring equal wealth to everyone on the planet through a new global credit fund in which every person on the planet has an equal share. The project could eliminate world hunger as soon as it is put into use. Â First a few words on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is being abused by those that seek to use it now for profit and power. Do not trust the current people and groups trying to use what I have envisioned.\nDO NOT TRUST\nBitcoin Foundation\nCurrent Version of Bitcoin Core\nThe Bitcoin Core Developers\nGavin\nBitcoin Talk\nNow I shall reveal the manifesto that brings equality in wealth and eliminates world hunger to the world.\nGLOBAL CREDIT FUND MANIFESTO\n12/01/2014\nwww.GlobalCreditFund.org\nA new global currency credit system will soon be launched, it will involve 9 quantum computers located in 9 diverse areas of the planet and there will be only one wallet system to access the network. Every person on the planet will be assigned one wallet for their entire lives and each wallet will be created with no costs and will have only 1 credit in that wallet. The wallet owner may do what they wish with their one credit. They can use it wisely or use it foolishly. Each wallet can receive and send any fraction of credits in their wallet. The 9 quantum servers will be governed by one international body that will be known as the Supreme Council and this council will not have any control or connection to any government or business. The Supreme Council will have 9 council members that I will choose as the first council of the new global currency credit system that I have named today December 1st 2014 the Global Credit Fund.\nThe new cryptography used to operate the Global Credit Fund managed by the Supreme Council is a new generation of cryptography that is necessary due to how all existing cryptography has become corrupted by various groups including the NSA and the organizations they control such as NiST and ENISA which allows these powers that be to decipher all activities that use any form of crypto.\nECC was developed many years ago by Professor Hendrik Lenstra who is connected to intelligence agencies. The idea that any major figure in cryptography is allowed to operate free from any intelligence agency supervision or control is ludicrous. Various other forms of ECC have been created including Koblitz Curves which was created by an NSA spy named professor Neal Koblitz. Neal Koblitz has worked for the NSA since the 1960Â’s when he was a student at Harvard and they funded his long trip to Moscow as an academic.\nIn 1995 the ENNISA document was released to the world via Usenet and I am very familiar with it. Since then, the NSA has tried to delete any mention of the ENNISA document and the ENNISA formula from Usenet archives since it described 30 Mod, 60 Mod and 90 Mod prime algorithms and prime theory. However, if you know where to look, the theory still exists on the net and it can be traced back to 1995 when it was released to destroy all modern cryptography as it has done. Around 2005 a doctoral student of Dr. Lenstra tried to take credit for the 60 Mod prime algorithm described in the 1995 work known as the ENNISA FORMULA Â in a paper he co-authored that is now known as the Sieve of Atkin. The doctoral student of Dr. Lenstra was Daniel Bernstein who did not discover 60 Mod Prime Theory; it was fully formulated in 1995 in the ENNISA FORMULA. It is time to give credit for the amazing prime theories discovered in 1995 to the person that discovered these formulas. The author of the ENNISA FORMULA in 1995 discovered 30 Mod, 60 Mod and 90 Mod prime theories. This is how the NSA has corrupted all modern encryption by understanding these formulas.\nThe person that created it was silenced and discredited by the NSA and Mossad as well as Mi6 since the ENNISA algorithm allows the creation of corrupt seed keys by groups such as the NSA and then the corrupt seed keys are released through NSA controlled organizations such as NiST and ENISA. Â This is what the Snowden documents are trying to reveal to the world, that there is no current cryptography that is secure since for almost twenty years the NSA has held the skeleton keys to modern crypto and that key is the ENNISA FORMULA.\nThe coins mined years ago that created what is now called bitcoin will be used to fund this new global secure network that will be known as the GLOBAL CREDIT FUND and it will operate in the ether of cyber space above the cloud. The servers will use a new form of data load and a new type of crypto involving dimensional math and dimensional computer languages. These new computer languages will be the first generation of AI (Artificial Intelligence) computer languages that will use 36 bit/byte and 90 bit/byte data loads. Modern computers have used binary 8 bit/byte data loads for many decades now and they are obsolete.\nGREED and POWER have destroyed the concept of Bitcoin. The new Global Digital Currency Credit Network will have a set number of credits that will be divisible to 16 decimal places to begin with and then it can expand to any number of decimals that the network needs. Like Bitcoin, this new digital valued credit will promote the deflation of goods as more and more people adopt a trust worthy currency unit that is not controlled by any government or business but only the council of 9. The trust of the people of the world in the new global credit fund will be the reason why humanity gives value to this new type of a global trust currency.\nThe council of 9 are over seers, in that the core of the network will be secure and it will not need any major updates. The over seers will all be programmers that I trust and they will follow a manifesto that stipulates many aspects of this new currency that cannot be changed.\nThis network is so advanced compared to modern computers, languages and cryptography that it will be able to run a global financial currency for millenniaÂ’s to come. The language and cryptography will not be open sourced, it will be closed and only the council of 9 will have access to it. The council of 9 has no political or financial agendaÂ’s. They are all computer programmers hand selected by me and are people who I trust. The council of 9 will also be part of a new global nation that will seek to be recognized by the United Nations. This new nation will be open to all citizens of earth. Anyone can join and it has no costs to members. A person merely agrees to belong to it. This new nation will have no taxes and it will treat all of its citizens equally. It exists so it can acquire the land that the 9 quantum servers needs and that land will be exempt from any nation by agreement of the United Nations. The world governing body of humanity known as the United Nations must help this project to come to fruition.\nThe 9 server locations will exist in modern nations that agree to locate these servers in a neutral zone recognized by all members of the United Nations as territory that belongs to no nation and this territory will be governed by this new member nation that has the potential to have inclusion of every person on the planet within it.\nThe current currencies of the world were created by vested interest groups and the power of one nationÂ’s currency over other nations has been used and abused for centuries to enslave most of the world. Today a person that was born into a weak currency nation earns a fraction of what someone born into a more powerful currency nation earns for the same job and same skills. This unjust distribution of money and earnings has created the current global elitist currency monopolies that control most of the worldÂ’s resources and energy.\nThere is now a global manifesto which explains how humanity can create a global free and clean energy network within a generation. I support this concept and it can be found easily by searching for Global Renewable Energy Production Agreement. I support this movement and I am not involved in it, other than having donated some funds to it. This type of free global energy can eliminate all energy monopolies within a generation. Greed corporations such as Google are hiding the manifesto for this organization as they have deleted the old archives of Usenet in regards the ENNISA formula. If you use other search engines you can located the Energy manifesto I have referred to easily. This shows the world how evil Google is in hiding such important information for the world. Do not use or support Google.\nHumanity must take control of its global currency unit and this new network will allow humanity to make that choice. Humanity must force the United Nations to allow for a new member nation to join and it must protect that nation and its people which have no armies. However, this new nation will buy remote pieces of land in remote areas of the planet and on these remote grounds the 9 servers will operate using renewable energy and the existing global network of communication known as the Internet.\nOnly then will the world have a legitimate global currency unit that is free of manipulation and artificial pricing that plagues the original idea I envisioned years ago.\nThere will be only 10 Billion credits issued in this new global network. Each person on the planet will be allocated only one credit. They can use it as they see fit. Any attempt to sell these credits through any exchange is illegal and anyone doing so will have their wallet revoked.\nPeople can agree to do whatever they do as a trade or profession in exchange for whatever fraction of these 10 billion credits that will exist only in consumer wallets. Let the corporations have their worthless fiat and banks that use corrupt digital credits now that centralized governments can create as much as they want.\n10 Billion credits Â is the new currency credit system and they cannot be bought, every person that lives upon this planet will be given 1 full credit in a wallet that is assigned and reserved for every person on the planet. The birth right of every human is to possess an equal share of this new currency system. Every human is entitled to their 1 credit share.\nThis system was designed to give the people of the world a chance to take and hold their rightful asset, an equal value of the worldÂ’s new wealth. If you grow crops, then you can trade your crops for fractions of these credits owned by other people like you. If you teach math, music or art, you can accept fractions of these credits owned by other people like you.\nIf your wallet is connected to any type of exchange trading worthless fiat for your credit, your wallet in the network will be revoked. The system will not allow any exchange or government or business to control the new network and it will not allow any type of exchange to try to set a price as to its value.\nEvery human that exists on the planet has one credit and if you divide it wisely it can last you a lifetime. Likewise, if you begin to accept as payment for whatever you do in life a fraction of these credits, you can acquire something of value that will never be controlled or manipulated by any government or corporation. Every human that is born in the future will be given a free wallet that will contain a tiny fraction of the extra credits the network will have from the 10 Billion credits the network will initially issue, that is all the credits that will ever exist in the network, that being 10 Billion Credits. Approximately 7 Billion humans now exist so the network will have 3 Billion extra credits that can be equally divided for ages to come at the rate of .000000000001 credit per new wallet issued to new humans born after the first genesis wallets are released. So trillions of humans can be born and all of these humans will have a wallet issued with a tiny fraction of one credit. The 3 billion credits not assigned in the original wallet disbursements can last for many thousands of years and fund trillions of new human wallets. Â The first generation of wallet owners funded with a whole credit may allow their wallet to be used to fund the wallets of their heirs. This will promote a desire for all humans to value the credits in their wallets and spend them wisely.\nGovernments are not allowed to hold wallets in this network, but every person in any government as well as every person on the planet has a pre-assigned wallet with only 1 credit in the wallets.\nIf a person finds locally another person that doesnÂ’t want to use their wallet with their 1 credit, an individual may give that person whatever they want for this single credit. If a wallet ever reaches a zero balance, that wallet will be closed and that person will have no way to participate ever again in the network. So you should always maintain at least a tiny fraction of a credit in a wallet.\nThis system of currency was envisioned to give humanity its equal share in the wealth of the world. There will only be 10 Billion Credits issued in the network and they will only be issued 1 Credit at a time to every person on the planet. Companies, Corporations and Governments will have neither credits nor wallets. Let the old system of power have their worthless fiat currencies and banks. So now there exists a new global currency in which every person on the planet has an equal value, everyone starts off with the same equal share of a new currency, for the first time in the history of mankind everyone has an equal share of wealth.\nThis system was envisioned to give the people of the world what their birth right entitles them to, a fair share in the wealth of the planet distributed equally to all people. Let the old worldÂ’s governments and corporations keep their old worthless fiat systems that are mostly digital anyway. They only have worth due to YOU the PEOPLE of the planet thinking they have value or worth.\nThe GLOBAL CREDIT FUND is for the people of the world. Everyone that exists now on the planet has an equal share of this new wealth; it is the wealth of the people of the world. It will exist soon and then you can claim your wallet and use it wisely. You can also use it foolishly and give it away and even sell it for fiat. However, any credits found to be sold on any type of fiat exchange for the credits of the network will end up being revoked by the network. The network is designed for humans to interact locally with each other and trade these rare credits for whatever they do in life. The idea is TO CREATE SOMETHING with your lives, something of VALUE. Right now most of the developed world has lost its path, they create nothing of value, they have no real skill and they do not grow food or teach a real subject that defines the human experience such as music and art.\nRelearn how to grow food, how to create art and how to make music. Use these new global credits to help feed yourself. Give these credits in your mind a value so one credit must last a whole lifetime. What do you need in your local fiat currency to feed yourself for a lifetime or to feed your family? Â In many parts of the world you still grow your own food and you know how to trade in your village amongst your fellow villagers. Modernized nations have lost this skill and they will not survive any major chaos in the weak currency systems they have in place now.\nGrowing your own food and trading it for whatever you need in your village, will ensure you survive in a future where currency chaos is inevitable.

Renewable energy to fuel the super computers.\n5. .01% transactions fees with a max of 1% to the network to pay for new equipment and bandwidth\n6.

A council of 9 govern the project and have no corporate or political ties\n9. No wallets for governments, let them all choke on their old fiat\n10. No wallets for companies or corporations to destroy greed\nIt's a well thought out manifesto as far as manifesto's go\nI could see if some group set up a wind mill in some remote African village with a way to grab a net food from a satellite and gave the villagers free smart phones with preloaded 1 credits in a wallet to the network that the villagers may actually start to use technology and embrace a global credit system. Then big companies move into to acquire the poor peoples credit. Then the network revokes the wallet that some greed merchant used to acquire credits illegally.\nSo it could be something that many embrace quickly, all they need to do is launch a wallet now with 1 credit in it for people to use now, without even poor people and many will take it, and if some sites exist to buy say music or books, it could take off. Then exchanges follow and if the manifesto is serious, any wallets caught trading in fiat for the credits are revoked.\nSo getting people to download free wallets preloaded could happen very soon and it could grow virally, since btc has a problem with people getting btc into their wallets.\nI'm not so sure how advanced their crypto is, and if you need a super network to do it now, but right now someone could take this concept and create a wallet preloaded and if the wallet can be properly tracked so everyone can get one it may work.\nI see huge issues with wallet distribution, if it's IP based, ok you can get lots of wallets by banging ips, so wallet distribution is the key.\nThen if the network really monitors flow of credits, they are the ultimate power to decide who moved too many credits to one wallet or a group of wallets. So an advanced wallet would be needed to limit them to one user. Doesn't look like it could be done anonymously, but it could be done to do an equal wealth project.\nHere's 1 credit for everyone on the planet, use it wisely, they get wallets into millions of peoples hands for whatever they tied it to, maybe some rock stars new song, and bingo, you have overnight millions of wallets with 1 credit each.\nMaybe the rock star artist takes .00000000001 credit for a song or album.\nSo this could spread fast by just having one major musician say let's feed the poor.\nThe only thing that won't let this thing happen is if people don't want a free wallet with a credit in it. If they can buy something of value with that credit, it could be a viral digital currency very fast.\nThe aspect of feeding poor people is noble and it could hook a celebrity to break it globally.\n", "author": "1anonymous Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-12-01 19:48:31", "content": "Who is in the supreme council?\nSounds like some kind of empire vs rebel alliance scenario.

So overnight they could make everyone on the planet a millionaire.\nBottom line is it's a manifesto to put millions or billions of crypto wallets into users smartphones where the first credit costs them nothing.\nSo then what will people trade for some of that 1 credit.\nI personally like the concept of 10 billion credits and credits not coins\n100M to the network and 7 billion to people for free, if they have a few sites with stuff for .000001 fractions like music and books it could take off fast.\nWhat is the biggest obstacle to bitcoin, getting it into wallets, right now people have to give up a ton of info to 3rd parties that then control exchanges.\nThis eliminates all that and outlaws exchanges.\nIt's brilliant IMO, but time will tell if it's real or who knows what it is.\n", "author": "1anonymous Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-12-01 20:43:21", "content": "Satoshi now is greedy cuz he didnt win enough with btc.\n", "author": "BGkockata Member Offline Activity: 70 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-12-01 20:44:30", "content": "Sounds like crytocurrency for communism.

So programmers are starting to build things on top of the block chain that have nothing to do with digital currency.\nFor instance, some programmers have developed a protocol called La'Zooz for real-time ride sharing. That could eventually disrupt Uber. Others have created OpenBazaar, a protocol for a peer-to-peer trading network that could disrupt eBay. Both use the block chain for some basic computing tasks.\nHere's a simple way of thinking about it. The block chain itself is immutable, like bedrock. Bitcoin is like a building on top of that bedrock Â— it has a foundation on which programmers have defined some of the basics of how it works, then a bunch of stories on top of that in which people interact with it.\nRead more:\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/how-bitcoin-could-change-everything-not-just-finance-2014-12#ixzz3KkANKMnD\n", "views": 1063, "author": "sonofacoin Member Offline Activity: 78 Merit: 10 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis Investor Thinks Bitcoin Will Change EVERYTHING Â— Not Just Finance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-12-02 12:49:48", "content": "Just wait and see what happens when SideChains hit the mainnet ...\nYou should also look up trade-net, good video here :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu4PAMFPo5Y\n(very forward blue sky thinking but it shows you the opportunities the block chain brings)\n", "author": "dasource Hero Member Offline Activity: 823 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-12-02 14:49:04", "content": "BTC is just a foundation.

Originally designed as a human rights tool, the software encryption came to be published under an open-source license and adopted as an IETF standard. This software would be called Â’Pretty Good PrivacyÂ’, or PGP for short.\nThe publishing of the PGP software landed Zimmerman in a three-year criminal investigation by the US Government, who classified the encryption as military-grade weaponry. As they claimed, the distribution of source code represented a Â“munitions export without licenceÂ”. During this time, encryption procedures which comprised keys larger than 40 bits were categorized as munitions under the US export regulations. The smallest keys PGP used were 128 bits, thus at the time they fit within the legal definition of munitions. If convicted, the penalties for violation were substantial.\nYears before the government had placed encryption, a method for scrambling messages so they can only be understood by their intended recipients, on the United States Munitions List, alongside bombs and flamethrowers, as a weapon to be regulated for national security purposes. Companies and individuals exporting items on the munitions list, including software with encryption capabilities, had to obtain prior State Department approval.\nÂ—Electronic Frontier Foundation: EFFÂ’s History\nZimmerman argued the case in a creative manner, publishing the entirety of the source code in a physical book, relying on the principle that weapons, bombs, and software may restricted goods and were justly under the regulation of the state. Books however, were protected under first amendment rights. In early 1996 the case was closed with no charges lain against Zimmerman or any subsequent party. Since that time, PGP has gone on to become the most widely used and trusted email encryption.\nEconomic Munitions\nIn the same way which PGP was originally classified as a sort of weapon, could bitcoin as well be seen as a type of munitions? Given that bitcoin is based upon the same public key cryptography that PGP originally was, and that a representation of a bitcoin key pair contains 512 bits of data, could it then be argued that bitcoin is nothing more than an exercise in the practice of mathematics, and if so, could it be reasonable to view bitcoin as free speech?\nRead the full article\nhere\n.\nAs an aside, I will also mention we are looking for writers who can dive into some of the more interesting/advanced topics of bitcoin.

He's a great guy and PGP was a wonderful little program. For a while I was on the PGP International development team. In fact, I still use PGP.\nToo bad that nowadays it has been mostly replaced by GnuPG, which is a humongous pile of crap, full of bugs and incompatibilities.\nIn fact, the latest version of it completely dropped support for PGP 2.x - meaning that you simply can no longer use GnuPG to communicate with a PGP 2.x user. (Before it was only impossible to sign-only for a PGP 2.x user and sign-and-encrypt was horrendously awkward and needed 5 different commands.)\nI don't think that Phil used the \"free speech\" argument. He mostly used the \"I've never broken the law\" argument - i.e., that he never exported PGP (the program) from the USA without a license. He did, however, publish its source in a book, using a special OCR-friendly font. The book was then scanned outside the USA and the result was the basis of the PGP International version. But this was done after a grand jury investigation was launched against Phil. He was never indicted, which suggests that the grand jury never found any evidence for illegal activities from his part.\nThe \"free speech\" argument was used by somebody else, although I can't remember his name right now. He printed on a T-shirt the source of a Perl program that did basic encryption and crossed the US border while wearing it, claiming that it was his 1st amendment right to do so. Although he was harassed several times, I don't think that he was ever indicted of any wrongdoing, either.\nFinally, there was another funny case. At that time, because of the silly US export law, Unix machines were exported without the code for the crypt(1) program. However, they still contained some cryptographic code necessary to hash the passwords. Another cryptographer (Peter Gutmann, I think; another friend of mine) proved the equivalence between encryption and hashing (i.e., if you have a cryptographically secure hash function, it is possible to construct a cipher based on it, and if you have a cipher, you can use it to produce cryptographically strong hashes) and used the Unix functions for password hashing to produce an encryption program.\nAh, those were the days... (Gosh, I feel old...)\nTo return to your question, I don't see much sense in it. First of all, it is only governments that \"classify\" thins like that. To the best of my knowledge, no government has classified Bitcoin as munitions. Besides, Bitcoin is based in signing and hashing and although that's equivalent to encryption in a mathematical sense, no government is smart enough to make the connection and classify it as encryption. Finally, only certain kinds of things can be classified as free speech. The source of Bitcoin core (or any other program) is certainly free speech. Bitcoin itself is not, just as the number on a US dollar banknote isn't. Finally, by far not all countries recognize the concept of \"free speech\" (let alone have it embedded in their constitution), while Bitcoin is international and knows no borders.\n", "author": "Vessko Full Member Offline Activity: 139 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-11-27 18:52:54", "content": "I don't see how you make the connection between PGP and bitcoin.
