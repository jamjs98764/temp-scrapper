So, if the problem was hashes per second, people will always try to find the best way to hash using the best possible tool. However, say the best tool required diamond crystal to function, then only a certain few would have access to such specialized tool. Bitcoin allows such tools without a problem and should always be friendly to quantum hashing if it came across. But we cant forget the the coin distribution is almost like buying lottery tickets, where you can win with very little if you're lucky, and also lose a lot and never win anything at all. Thats how the coin distribution works, so we basically cut out the lotto tickets for those people that can only afford cpu hashes. And by doing that, yes we failed. But its a small error easily corrected but unfortunately much of the wealth has already been centrally distributed amongst the power miners.

I buy bitcoin on occasion but only to buy clams because I know I can put it into my client and stake rather than trying to compete with huge resources halfway around the globe.\nI know you guys can pick apart my argument here and quite likely show me how wrong I am, but to me this is reality. I have been in crypto currency for 3 years now. If BTC looks hopeless to me how does it look to the average person that knows very little about it?\nthe mining wont ever find a way to be ethically restricted to solo mining. but mining is not the important thing..\nput it this way, if a dodgy miners decided to relay out a block that doesnt have enough 0000 in its hash to prove the difficulty. or the size of the block was 3mb.. everyone would ignore it, the block will be orphaned and the miner cant spend the reward.\nso without mining, users have power..\nin currency in general.. people dont need to buy a stick of dynamite/pickaxe to get into gold. people dont need a bank note printing machine to get into fiat.\nbut as long as people can spot fools gold or a counterfeit bank note. it can keep the circulation of currency under control\nwhat should be the mindset is that the rich and dedicated people can invest big in petahashes of hardware, as that protects the network, and they can be awarded accordingly.. but if they do anything negative.. we will simply ignore their blocks and leave them penniless..\nwhich is another incentive to not go off the rails.\nwe should make it easier for people to understand how users control what is acceptable and also control any acceptable changes without needing to rely on third party updates or trust\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Offline Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2016-01-17 22:59:50", "content": "It was a sad day when asics kicked in and tossed off GPU and CPU miners.

Kyoto is an very historical city, which goes back centuries in the past and whose culture is extremely well preserved. It's almost a town. You can bike from one end to the other in no time. That's actually how most tourists travel in Kyoto: by bike. It's a really different and interesting experience (Kyoto, and even more so Nara, are some of the most beautiful places I've ever been to), but you wouldn't want to have a big party there.\nTokyo, on the other hand is a modern capital city, much like any other big city that you could find in any developed country. Of course it's still in Japan, with Japanese stuff there. But it's far from being the same experience that you'd have in Kyoto. Tokyo is much more appropriate for a millionaire's party.\nIt's a bit like comparing Ljubljana or Venice to London. Whole different stuff.\nAnyway. Keep this thought away from me.

Why can't people understand that?\nAnyway, there is no Plan B because Bitcoin was not designed and created as a means to achieve a specific goal.\nIt somewhat does rely on the exchange rate because so much has been invested in mining equipment that it would be turned off (causing the network to become less secure) if the exchange rate were to decline too much for too long of a time. Even if the exchange rate would later rebound miners would be less willing to invest in new equipment which would decrease the long term security of the bitcoin network\n", "author": "needFREElunch Full Member Offline Activity: 196 Merit: 100 Hi "}, {"date": "2015-01-03 09:14:54", "content": "The thread title should be \"If BitCoin fails\"... as it is it's too definite.\nBut yeah, people should always have a contingency plan\n", "author": "AnonBitCoiner Full Member Offline Activity: 364 Merit: 106 "}, {"date": "2015-01-03 09:54:18", "content": "There is no plan B.\n", "author": "Agestorzrxx Sr. Member Offline Activity: 462 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-01-03 10:22:48", "content": "I have no idea.\nMaybe altcoin?\n", "author": "ikydesu Hero Member Offline Activity: 686 Merit: 500 fb.com/Bitky.shop | Bitcoin Merch!Premium Quality!

There was even a lawyer there and his explanation never made sense to me either.\nMoney laundering is, to me, making \"dirty money\" clean. What constitutes 'dirty money\"? It is any money gotten from illegal activity. What constitutes \"clean money\"? Anything in a bank account, real estate, merchandise etc. that can pass through the financial system without drawing scrutiny. I'm not sure but I don't think AML even kicks in when transferring large amounts of money from one bank to another because the money coming in is assumed to be clean. It is the cash deposits that the criminals are trying to make clean, not the digital ones.\nSo criminal has 1 million in cash and buys 1 million Bitcoin with it. He no longer has cash but as Bitcoin. Someone else has the cash so what happens when they try to deposit it? AML! The could just keep it in cash like the criminal does but it is still not \"clean money\".\nSo now the criminal has 1 million worth of Bitcoin and puts them in an exchange. he buys, sells trades etc. Then he opts out and they send him a check. The question comes down to whether the check represents \"dirty\" or \"clean\" money? The problem is that the exchange enabled the Bitcoin to enter the banking system and become \"clean\" because it is now digitized.\nThe moral of the story is that the only money considered \"clean\" is the fraudulent digital money and all cash money (whether acquired legitimately or not) is \"dirty\".\n", "author": "Bungeebones Full Member Offline Activity: 180 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 21:51:46", "content": "its more easier with bitcoin, where did you get this idea from its harder? the user can remain totally anonymous if he has some basic skills of tor etc. plus its non reversible.\n", "author": "Thekool1s Legendary Offline Activity: 1008 Merit: 1039 PM for Social Media/Signature Campaign Management "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 22:11:10", "content": "How to Launder Money the Old Way:\n1.

It's way beyond \"profit\", way beyond business.\nPlease share your thoughts!\nThe best way to encourage mainstream adoption is not necessarily with skills or elaborate schemes, but simply introducing people to bitcoin. Give BTC as gifts/presents and show the recipient how to use a wallet, or exchange it to cash if needed. Ask small local stores if they accept bitcoin, if they seem interested volunteer to show them how to setup a wallet or to visit Bitpay or other processor to accept BTC and convert it into Fiat. Until people are actually exposed to it, most will seem put-off and not trust it. Once they are exposed, they may embrace it and spread the word further, so if you expose 10 people to BTC and even if only 2 of them go on to expose others to BTC, its adoption will grow.\nThe problem is most people simply want it to magically succeed with no time or financial investments of their own. By investments, I am not talking about buying 100 BTC and hope it grows, but the investment of giving BTC away to introduce others to it, or donating your time to help people get to know and use it better. That's the kind of investments we are in most need of right now.\n", "author": "Za1n Legendary Offline Activity: 952 Merit: 1007 "}, {"date": "2016-02-05 06:13:36", "content": "I once walked into a computer store and filled my trolley with expensive goods.

And do they sell a lot of stuff for bitcoin? I can imagine that they stop accepting it if people don't use the option. At least the manager is now likely to be into bitcoin though.\n", "author": "NorrisK Legendary Online Activity: 1708 Merit: 1003 "}, {"date": "2016-02-05 06:31:20", "content": "Best way for non techy people to adopt Bitcoin is to showcase and demonstrate it's step by steps usage in the simplest way to them.

No one but a crusty handful believes it's a valid course.\nThey have their reasons for sure. Let me quote theymos' statement for you:\nI'm impressed at the level of Bitcoin knowledge of bitcointalk.org users compared to /r/Bitcoin users.\nMost of the people in this thread and other similar threads are interpreting the issues correctly (or at least with some evidence of actual thought), unlike most Redditors.\nI don't think it makes sense to call Bitcoin XT an alt-coin anymore than it does the current version of Bitcoin Core, which has hard-forked several times since it was introduced.  Furthermore, Bitcoin Core will only fork away from Bitcoin XT when XT has 75% of the hash power behind it.\nBitcoin's hardforks (though some people don't classify them as hardforks) were done with consensus among the the Bitcoin community/economy/experts. In the current state of the debate, any max block size increase won't have consensus, though I think that consensus on a compromise proposal might be achievable in 6-18 months.\nActivating a hardfork based on what miners do is really bad. You could easily have a situation where 75% of miners support XT but none of the big Bitcoin exchanges or businesses do. Then miners would start mining coins that they couldn't spend anywhere useful, and SPV users would find that they can't transact with the businesses they want to deal with. The currency would be split, and in this case XT would be in a far weaker position than Bitcoin. The\npossibility\nof this sort of network/currency split is what makes XT not a \"legitimate hardfork\", but rather the programmed creation of an altcoin. A consensus hardfork can only go forward once it has been determined that it's nearly impossible for the Bitcoin economy to split in any significant way. Not\nevery Bitcoin user on Earth\nhas to agree, but enough that there won't be a noticeable split.\nBitcoin is not ruled by miners. In a hardfork, miners barely matter at all. (Softforks are different.) What's important is what the\neconomy\ndoes.\n", "author": "dothebeats Legendary Offline Activity: 1582 Merit: 1064 Deleted posts: 91 "}, {"date": "2015-08-11 21:42:23", "content": "They have their reasons for sure.

I believe those bitcoin exchanges can also do several thousand transactions per second, or even millions like Nasdaq. In fact there are already large amount of transactions done in exchanges.\nTransaction on blockchain is totally a different thing, its like transaction between different banks.

You could easily have a situation where 75% of miners support XT but none of the big Bitcoin exchanges or businesses do. Then miners would start mining coins that they couldn't spend anywhere useful, and SPV users would find that they can't transact with the businesses they want to deal with.

While many people in the developed world take credit cards and debit cards for granted, there are billions of people around the world who are forced out of the digital economy and stuck moving physical cash whenever they need to make a transaction:\nIf you are one of the five billion people who live on cash  theres a little over a billion people who have credit cards and debit cards, most of the world does not have that. So, theyve seen this revolution go by them. They cannot benefit in any way, and they have to rely on cash. Cash is expensive to keep at home, its expensive to transport, its risky, all payments [require] that you move there physically  usually by public transportation that is slow, increasing the risk of it being stolen.

You could easily have a situation where 75% of miners support XT but none of the big Bitcoin exchanges or businesses do. Then miners would start mining coins that they couldn't spend anywhere useful, and SPV users would find that they can't transact with the businesses they want to deal with. The currency would be split, and in this case XT would be in a far weaker position than Bitcoin.\nThe\npossibility\nof this sort of network/currency split is what makes XT not a \"legitimate hardfork\", but rather the programmed creation of an altcoin. A consensus hardfork can only go forward once it has been determined that it's nearly impossible for the Bitcoin economy to split in any significant way.\nNot\nevery Bitcoin user on Earth\nhas to agree, but enough that there won't be a noticeable split.\nBitcoin is not ruled by miners. In a hardfork, miners barely matter at all. (Softforks are different.) What's important is what the\neconomy\ndoes.\nFace it old buddy, XT got rekt like Stannis at Winterfell.\nNow, when can I order my 1000 XMR 1oz Platinum Lealana?  Do you want Cryptonic to eat your lunch?\n\"1.

We've heard such prophecies many times till now but back in 2013 I didn't expect to see this an argument in a propaganda campaign.\nFurthermore the reason Gavin Andresen stopped having his ideas implemented in Core was because there wasn't consensus about them. There were hundreds of perfectly good reasons to not support bitcoin XT, people that no longer trust Gavin are still called FUDsters and dictators. Prior to this schism, the only update channel was bitcoin Core and as long as the majority of the users behind this channel don't approve of new changes implemented to bitcoin, implementations with them included are not bitcoin.

So in the best of this kind of cases bitcoin can be legalized and regulated to be used together with the national money but always having everything within their control. So if bitcoin can become risky can be banned without problem in every moment. We have e few important, developed and influential countries which are not doing this but are on this point of view (USA, Germany, Swiss, Canada and hopefully soon even China). In the worst of cases we find the traditionally conservative countries lead by probably, hidden or openly appeared, dictators or closed mind leaders the most typical of whom is Putin and its country about which is talked in this thread. They want everything under their total control and is out of mind that can accept a symbol of freedom and Independence like bitcoin to be used free in their propriety named Russia. First of all because of their economic policies (affected and controlled by the politics). So make everything in their hands to stop it. Totally in vain effort.

If youre correct you earn the options payoff, if youre incorrect you lose your investment. Each Bitcoin binary option has a specific expiration date at which the option is checked to see if its In the money (you were correct) or Out of the money (you were incorrect). Each Bitcoin binary option also has a specific payoff that you can win. They are called Binary Options because the outcome is either win or lose, theres nothing in between.\nAn example for Bitcoin Binary Option Trading\nFor example, lets say its 10am and the BTC price is $575.505. You believe that by 5:10pm on March 17th the price will be higher than $575.505 so you buy a Call option. If at 4pm the BTC price is higher than $575.505, you earn the payout of 73% of your investment, if its lower, you lose. Another example is if you think the BTC price will go down. You then buy a Put option. If the price at the expiration time is lower than the original price, you earn the options payout.\nThe Upside of Bitcoin Binary Options\nYou dont have to know the exact value of Bitcoin when the option expires, only if it increased or decreased.\nYou dont have to have extensive knowledge in trading to participate in Bitcoin binary options.\nPayout can reach up to 88% return on investment.\nThe Downside of Bitcoin Binary Options\nAs you may have noticed, Bitcoin binary options have a great similarity to plain gambling. If you study binary options in detail you will see that the trading platform will always have an edge over the investor (you need to win over 50% of the time just to break even).\nBecause of the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin binary options many countries have strict regulations regarding who is allowed to operate such a business, it is advisable to check if the exchange were you wish to trade Bitcoin binary options is regulated. Also Bitcoin options can become highly addictive (just like gambling), and no matter how knowledgable you are, its impossible to consistently predict what Bitcoin prices will do within a short time frame.\nIf I wasnt clear enough until now, then keep in mind that trading in Binary Options is highly speculative and involves a significant risk of loss.

Let's look at how badly Bitcoin scales via the block size limit.\nLet's say that 700 million people use Bitcoin (that's ~10% of the World population, even less), and that they all make only 1 transaction per day. Transaction size is averaging half a kilobyte today (source Bitcoin Wiki).\n700 million transactions * 0.5 = 350 million Kilobyte = ~350 GB/ 144 (blocks per day) =\n~2.4 Gigabyte per block.\nThis is only if they make\na single transaction per day\n(which is unlikely, as the average would be much higher with adoption on this scale).\nWithout off-chain solutions such as LN, Bitcoin doesn't have a future on a global scale.

This way, you Joe the noob who just heard about bitcoin, downloaded the 2 week+ file size blockchain and can start \"generating\" coins from his laptop or favorite device.

So, if the problem was hashes per second, people will always try to find the best way to hash using the best possible tool. However, say the best tool required diamond crystal to function, then only a certain few would have access to such specialized tool. Bitcoin allows such tools without a problem and should always be friendly to quantum hashing if it came across. But we cant forget the the coin distribution is almost like buying lottery tickets, where you can win with very little if you're lucky, and also lose a lot and never win anything at all. Thats how the coin distribution works, so we basically cut out the lotto tickets for those people that can only afford cpu hashes. And by doing that, yes we failed. But its a small error easily corrected but unfortunately much of the wealth has already been centrally distributed amongst the power miners. Thats the main reason why the alt economy is growing steadily.\n", "author": "maria6.0 Jr. Member Offline Activity: 50 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2016-01-16 18:09:44", "content": "Everyone knows me, Maria OG.\nI am the oldest miner of this forum and I must say, we are getting distracted.

Why has nobody implemented something like this before and replaced Bitcoin?\nI guess my previous post was not clear.  Many alt coins have tried to create an \"ASIC proof\" coin to replace Bitcoin\nand have failed\n.  Part of the reason is that the alt coin space is filled with scam coins but the other reason is that proof of work requires work and work adds value.  The main point being Bitcoin is Bitcoin and any change, especially something major like a change to the mining algorithm, is no longer Bitcoin - it is just another alt.  So you can't change Bitcoin at a fundamental level like this\nby design\n.\nI agree with the ASIC's being more energy efficient and adding value with the energy/work being spend to sustain it, but there should be some better solution to place some mining power back into the hands of the general users, without sacrificing the value?\nI do not understand concern about getting \"mining power back in the hands of the general users\".\nWhen I got into mining I bought a very large tower computer with a very large 3000W power supply, added six GPU cards, ran them as fast as I could, joined a pool, and started mining.  Total cost to me was about $2500 and this thing used a lot of electricity.  Taking all the electricity bills into account [including AC] I probably just about broke even on the deal.  I would have been much better off by far to just have bought 500 BTC for the $2,500 and just held them.\nToday you can buy an S7 for about $1,500, set it up, join a pool and go for it.  I expect you will just about break even and that buying and holding $1,500 worth of BTC will probably make you more money in the long run.\nSo, it appears to me that not much has really changed.\nthere is no asic proof technology\n, if it can be mined with a gpu it can be mined with an asic, the difference is the cost involved, and forced by a certain algo, especially on the memory side\nbut if for the asic company this will be profitable they will certain jump on it, right now some algo seems immune to asic, only because their alt is useless, not worth anything\nThis.  The point is that if any \"ASIC proof\" coin were to actually take off and become worth anything then there would be a profit in creating machines to do it better, faster and more efficiently. Since there would be a profit in it someone would do it.\nThe economic success of any coin pretty much dooms it to centralization.\n", "author": "BurtW Legendary Offline Activity: 2310 Merit: 1007 All paid signature campaigns should be banned.

Still, I'd probably buy a big house with a swimming pool somewhere in the mountains in Switzerland, but I wouldn't go for these noisy parties in big cities too often.\nI vote for tokyo (or kyoto).\nDespite the fact that they sound similar, these are very different cities, mate\n(Plus if they sound so similar it's only by chance: Kyoto is 京都, and Tokyo is 東京, only the \"kyo\", which means \"city\", is really in common between them).\nThere's not much to do in Kyoto, apart from visiting temples and shrines. Kyoto is an very historical city, which goes back centuries in the past and whose culture is extremely well preserved. It's almost a town. You can bike from one end to the other in no time. That's actually how most tourists travel in Kyoto: by bike. It's a really different and interesting experience (Kyoto, and even more so Nara, are some of the most beautiful places I've ever been to), but you wouldn't want to have a big party there.\nTokyo, on the other hand is a modern capital city, much like any other big city that you could find in any developed country. Of course it's still in Japan, with Japanese stuff there. But it's far from being the same experience that you'd have in Kyoto. Tokyo is much more appropriate for a millionaire's party.\nIt's a bit like comparing Ljubljana or Venice to London. Whole different stuff.\nAnyway. Keep this thought away from me. Holding hopes higher than is rational is not for me. 1 BTC = 1 m USD is a sweet dream that has higher chances to not happen then it has to happen, even if bitcoin is destined to succeed.\n", "author": "Blind Legs Parker Hero Member Offline Activity: 910 Merit: 506 CH-EN-FR translator "}, {"date": "2016-01-12 09:23:15", "content": "I don't think this will ever happen but it's nice to dream and think about\nI would say Vegas would be a good place.

An Hero guy in Indonesia so to speak, can make more than 18$ a week, and that's a lot of money on such places.

Why can't people understand that?\nAnyway, there is no Plan B because Bitcoin was not designed and created as a means to achieve a specific goal.\nIt somewhat does rely on the exchange rate because so much has been invested in mining equipment that it would be turned off (causing the network to become less secure) if the exchange rate were to decline too much for too long of a time. Even if the exchange rate would later rebound miners would be less willing to invest in new equipment which would decrease the long term security of the bitcoin network\n", "author": "needFREElunch Full Member Offline Activity: 196 Merit: 100 Hi "}, {"date": "2015-01-03 09:14:54", "content": "The thread title should be \"If BitCoin fails\"... as it is it's too definite.\nBut yeah, people should always have a contingency plan\n", "author": "AnonBitCoiner Full Member Offline Activity: 364 Merit: 106 "}, {"date": "2015-01-03 09:54:18", "content": "There is no plan B.\n", "author": "Agestorzrxx Sr. Member Offline Activity: 462 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-01-03 10:22:48", "content": "I have no idea.\nMaybe altcoin?\n", "author": "ikydesu Hero Member Offline Activity: 686 Merit: 500 fb.com/Bitky.shop | Bitcoin Merch!Premium Quality!

It is any money gotten from illegal activity. What constitutes \"clean money\"? Anything in a bank account, real estate, merchandise etc. that can pass through the financial system without drawing scrutiny. I'm not sure but I don't think AML even kicks in when transferring large amounts of money from one bank to another because the money coming in is assumed to be clean. It is the cash deposits that the criminals are trying to make clean, not the digital ones.\nSo criminal has 1 million in cash and buys 1 million Bitcoin with it. He no longer has cash but as Bitcoin. Someone else has the cash so what happens when they try to deposit it? AML! The could just keep it in cash like the criminal does but it is still not \"clean money\".\nSo now the criminal has 1 million worth of Bitcoin and puts them in an exchange. he buys, sells trades etc. Then he opts out and they send him a check. The question comes down to whether the check represents \"dirty\" or \"clean\" money? The problem is that the exchange enabled the Bitcoin to enter the banking system and become \"clean\" because it is now digitized.\nThe moral of the story is that the only money considered \"clean\" is the fraudulent digital money and all cash money (whether acquired legitimately or not) is \"dirty\".\n", "author": "Bungeebones Full Member Offline Activity: 180 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 21:51:46", "content": "its more easier with bitcoin, where did you get this idea from its harder? the user can remain totally anonymous if he has some basic skills of tor etc. plus its non reversible.\n", "author": "Thekool1s Legendary Offline Activity: 1008 Merit: 1039 PM for Social Media/Signature Campaign Management "}, {"date": "2016-02-02 22:11:10", "content": "How to Launder Money the Old Way:\n1.

Any ideas?\nI'm talking about making money with bitcoins here. I'm talking about social change. It's way beyond \"profit\", way beyond business.\nPlease share your thoughts!\nThe best way to encourage mainstream adoption is not necessarily with skills or elaborate schemes, but simply introducing people to bitcoin. Give BTC as gifts/presents and show the recipient how to use a wallet, or exchange it to cash if needed. Ask small local stores if they accept bitcoin, if they seem interested volunteer to show them how to setup a wallet or to visit Bitpay or other processor to accept BTC and convert it into Fiat. Until people are actually exposed to it, most will seem put-off and not trust it. Once they are exposed, they may embrace it and spread the word further, so if you expose 10 people to BTC and even if only 2 of them go on to expose others to BTC, its adoption will grow.\nThe problem is most people simply want it to magically succeed with no time or financial investments of their own. By investments, I am not talking about buying 100 BTC and hope it grows, but the investment of giving BTC away to introduce others to it, or donating your time to help people get to know and use it better. That's the kind of investments we are in most need of right now.\n", "author": "Za1n Legendary Offline Activity: 952 Merit: 1007 "}, {"date": "2016-02-05 06:13:36", "content": "I once walked into a computer store and filled my trolley with expensive goods.

No one but a crusty handful believes it's a valid course.\nThey have their reasons for sure. Let me quote theymos' statement for you:\nI'm impressed at the level of Bitcoin knowledge of bitcointalk.org users compared to /r/Bitcoin users.\nMost of the people in this thread and other similar threads are interpreting the issues correctly (or at least with some evidence of actual thought), unlike most Redditors.\nI don't think it makes sense to call Bitcoin XT an alt-coin anymore than it does the current version of Bitcoin Core, which has hard-forked several times since it was introduced.  Furthermore, Bitcoin Core will only fork away from Bitcoin XT when XT has 75% of the hash power behind it.\nBitcoin's hardforks (though some people don't classify them as hardforks) were done with consensus among the the Bitcoin community/economy/experts. In the current state of the debate, any max block size increase won't have consensus, though I think that consensus on a compromise proposal might be achievable in 6-18 months.\nActivating a hardfork based on what miners do is really bad. You could easily have a situation where 75% of miners support XT but none of the big Bitcoin exchanges or businesses do. Then miners would start mining coins that they couldn't spend anywhere useful, and SPV users would find that they can't transact with the businesses they want to deal with. The currency would be split, and in this case XT would be in a far weaker position than Bitcoin. The\npossibility\nof this sort of network/currency split is what makes XT not a \"legitimate hardfork\", but rather the programmed creation of an altcoin. A consensus hardfork can only go forward once it has been determined that it's nearly impossible for the Bitcoin economy to split in any significant way. Not\nevery Bitcoin user on Earth\nhas to agree, but enough that there won't be a noticeable split.\nBitcoin is not ruled by miners. In a hardfork, miners barely matter at all. (Softforks are different.) What's important is what the\neconomy\ndoes.\n", "author": "dothebeats Legendary Offline Activity: 1582 Merit: 1064 Deleted posts: 91 "}, {"date": "2015-08-11 21:42:23", "content": "They have their reasons for sure.

While many people in the developed world take credit cards and debit cards for granted, there are billions of people around the world who are forced out of the digital economy and stuck moving physical cash whenever they need to make a transaction:\nIf you are one of the five billion people who live on cash  theres a little over a billion people who have credit cards and debit cards, most of the world does not have that. So, theyve seen this revolution go by them. They cannot benefit in any way, and they have to rely on cash. Cash is expensive to keep at home, its expensive to transport, its risky, all payments [require] that you move there physically  usually by public transportation that is slow, increasing the risk of it being stolen. Its ridiculous, but its very expensive to be poor. And its very expensive to live on cash.\n", "author": "iCEBREAKER Legendary Offline Activity: 2044 Merit: 1049 Crypto is the separation of Power and State.

We've heard such prophecies many times till now but back in 2013 I didn't expect to see this an argument in a propaganda campaign.\nFurthermore the reason Gavin Andresen stopped having his ideas implemented in Core was because there wasn't consensus about them. There were hundreds of perfectly good reasons to not support bitcoin XT, people that no longer trust Gavin are still called FUDsters and dictators. Prior to this schism, the only update channel was bitcoin Core and as long as the majority of the users behind this channel don't approve of new changes implemented to bitcoin, implementations with them included are not bitcoin.

If youre correct you earn the options payoff, if youre incorrect you lose your investment. Each Bitcoin binary option has a specific expiration date at which the option is checked to see if its In the money (you were correct) or Out of the money (you were incorrect). Each Bitcoin binary option also has a specific payoff that you can win. They are called Binary Options because the outcome is either win or lose, theres nothing in between.\nAn example for Bitcoin Binary Option Trading\nFor example, lets say its 10am and the BTC price is $575.505. You believe that by 5:10pm on March 17th the price will be higher than $575.505 so you buy a Call option. If at 4pm the BTC price is higher than $575.505, you earn the payout of 73% of your investment, if its lower, you lose. Another example is if you think the BTC price will go down. You then buy a Put option.

If youre correct you earn the options payoff, if youre incorrect you lose your investment. Each Bitcoin binary option has a specific expiration date at which the option is checked to see if its In the money (you were correct) or Out of the money (you were incorrect). Each Bitcoin binary option also has a specific payoff that you can win. They are called Binary Options because the outcome is either win or lose, theres nothing in between.\nAn example for Bitcoin Binary Option Trading\nFor example, lets say its 10am and the BTC price is $575.505. You believe that by 5:10pm on March 17th the price will be higher than $575.505 so you buy a Call option. If at 4pm the BTC price is higher than $575.505, you earn the payout of 73% of your investment, if its lower, you lose. Another example is if you think the BTC price will go down. You then buy a Put option. If the price at the expiration time is lower than the original price, you earn the options payout.\nThe Upside of Bitcoin Binary Options\nYou dont have to know the exact value of Bitcoin when the option expires, only if it increased or decreased.\nYou dont have to have extensive knowledge in trading to participate in Bitcoin binary options.\nPayout can reach up to 88% return on investment.\nThe Downside of Bitcoin Binary Options\nAs you may have noticed, Bitcoin binary options have a great similarity to plain gambling.

Let's look at how badly Bitcoin scales via the block size limit.\nLet's say that 700 million people use Bitcoin (that's ~10% of the World population, even less), and that they all make only 1 transaction per day. Transaction size is averaging half a kilobyte today (source Bitcoin Wiki).\n700 million transactions * 0.5 = 350 million Kilobyte = ~350 GB/ 144 (blocks per day) =\n~2.4 Gigabyte per block.\nThis is only if they make\na single transaction per day\n(which is unlikely, as the average would be much higher with adoption on this scale).\nWithout off-chain solutions such as LN, Bitcoin doesn't have a future on a global scale.

Never used such service it's a bit borderline I think. But yeah I understand that here you got to pay for it obviously...\nyou know that it is illegal to download copyright protected stuff and people get prosecuted over doing so? right?\nYou know that not anything free on the web is illegal right?\nAnd also that everyone download illegally copyright protected stuff without getting prosecuted ever?\nCopyright debate is about do you feel like the price you're asked is fair? And most of the time it isn't, that's why i download lots of movies and games.

Even because is mine too. Have no sense to pay for that who can be found for free. But there might be a problem here. If cannot be able to find \"that thing\" for free what to do. I have a friend who have my age (and I am not young) and I am sure that him have not touched a female in his life. Not to do more but only to touch. This kind of people what must to do? Remain to be made only two things (according to me):\n1. To die without prove even one touch of that part of humanity which is created exactly to be touched and to do even more from the other half (and this is really a sad thing), or\n2. To pay to have more than one touch. That second choice seems more appropriate for me than the number one.\nSo, what to do according to you?\n", "author": "n2004al Legendary Offline Activity: 1050 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2016-02-03 17:48:34", "content": "I think you have a miss understanding there.There is obviously free stuff like on Porn-Hub,but still they have premium  membership for users like they allow you watch unlimited HD videos or maybe download them.As far as I know,mostly bitcoins are used for Live Camera website so you can tip them,you know who.Basically,its makes stuff more easy ,instead of using credit cards and such,you can simply use your bitcoin address to access these services.Its good in a way.\n", "author": "Patatas Legendary Offline Activity: 1302 Merit: 1019 Crypto-Games.net: Multiple coins, multiple games "}], "date": "2016-02-03 14:19:57"}]}
