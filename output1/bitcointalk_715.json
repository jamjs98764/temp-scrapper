But amid stories of scandal, theft and turbulent prices, the general public has largely ignored the arguments of vocal supporters, who tout the digital currencys potential to cut costs by removing middlemen from finance and commerce.\nAccording to Silicon Valley investors such as those taking stakes in 21, say that failure to gain mass adoption is partly because the publics attention has been misguidedly focused on bitcoins limited potential as a digital alternative to traditional currencies. In reality, they say, its underlying technology has far wider applications than that. Unlike the currency transactions that are generally associated with bitcoin, these new uses could range from lawyer-free smart contracts to tamper-proof online voting systems.\n21s lead investors include U.S. venture-capital heavyweights Andreessen Horowitz and RRE Ventures, along with Chinese private-equity firm Yuan Capital, with a strategic stake going to chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.QCOM +0.49% through its venture-capital unit.\nAdditionally, Khosla Ventures and Data Collective have invested in 21, as well as chief executives and founders from various tech companies, including PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, eBay Inc. co-founder Jeff Skoll, Dropbox Inc. CEO Drew Houston, Expedia Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Zynga Inc. co-founder Mark Pincus.\nMr. Pauker said Qualcomms involvement is key. He hopes to exploit the Bridgewater, N.J., chipmakers mass-marketing and production capabilities in the development of a suite of consumer products that integrate with bitcoins core technology called the blockchain. This technology takes the form of a public, digital ledger thats maintained by a decentralized network of thousands of independently owned computers.\nQualcomms involvement could spur speculation that 21 has its sights on the so-called Internet of Things. Thats the idea that a myriad of smart, Internet-connected appliances will in the future communicate with servers, networks and each other to optimize their operation, maintenance and energy usage without direct human involvement.\nSome developers believe that bitcoin technology could play a key role in transparently managing the vast flow of information generated by these smart gadgets. The decentralized blockchain ledgers are free from the control of any one party, so smart appliances can in theory connect with computers built by other entities safely without worrying that the information was manipulated.\nStarting out under the earlier name of 21e6, the company  which takes its name from the 21-million limit that bitcoins managing algorithm imposes on the total number of bitcoins to be released  spurred intense speculation in November 2013, when a regulatory filing revealed a $5 million fundraise.\nMembers of the bitcoin community speculated about a secret vehicle for Silicon Valley elites to develop high-powered equipment that could dominate bitcoin mining. Mr. Paukers comments about a consumer focus suggest that isnt where the company has ended up.\nThe initial secrecy around 21 was solely for pragmatic reasons  we didnt have anything to say to the world,  says co-founder Balaji Srinivasan, who is also a partner at Andreessen Horowitz. He compares 21s work in building bitcoin products for the general public to the sequential development of 56-kilobit Internet modems, international fiber cables and wireless Internet towers, which all helped bring the Internet into peoples homes in the late 1990s.\nThis notion also has parallels with the mass Internet appeal achieved in the 1990s by the development of the Netscape browser by Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of Mr. Srinivasans firm. Asked for his views on 21, Mr. Andreessen said it is working on what they  and we  consider to be core infrastructure for mainstreaming bitcoin.\n21s announcement extends this years upswing in venture capitalists digital-currency investments, highlighted by Januarys $75 million fundraising for San Francisco-based bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase Inc., whose investors include the New York Stock Exchange. Bitcoin-focused venture capital more than tripled to $347 million in 2014 from a year earlier, according Coindesk.\nThe money flow is paving the way for products and services aimed at transitioning bitcoin from its volatile, Wild West beginnings into an era of more secure infrastructure and mass appeal.\nA week after its funding announcement, Coinbase unveiled the first licensed U.S bitcoin currency exchange. Later, high-tech security company BitGo Inc. launched a unique insurance program, while the New York-based Digital Currency Groups Bitcoin Investment Trust earned regulatory approval to become the first publicly offered fund dedicated to owning bitcoin.\nWell-funded custodial and financial services companies Xapo Ltd. and Circle Internet Financial Ltd. have also developed high-tech security and insurance projects. Meanwhile, San Francisco startup BitFury Holding BV has launched new, high-powered chips to take bitcoin mining to a new level of intensity.\nNone of this will matter if bitcoin doesnt achieve mass adoption, says Mr. Pauker.\nBitcoin is going to change the way that people and businesses and even machines interact with each other, he says. But for bitcoin to realize that vision we need mass adoption. It cant just be for Silicon Valley.\nThis is great under the radar news, mainly because only the silicon valley giants really know what 21 is all about.\nKnowing that so many brilliant people and companies are supporting and investing in this secretive company is going to be truly ground breaking.\nCan't wait to see what type of smart appliances or gadgets 21 comes up with, that will get the masses flocking to get a peek at this new Bitcoin centric tech.\n", "views": 3364, "author": "ChuckBuck Hero Member Offline Activity: 840 Merit: 510 Vietnamese translator - https://goo.gl/Muc9xi ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin Startup 21 raises record funding $116 mill, aims at mainstreaming BTC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-03-10 14:24:55", "content": "$116 million is an impressive number, I think they are the best funded bitcoin start up ever.\n", "author": "L Full Member Offline Activity: 182 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-03-10 14:29:01", "content": "$116 million is an impressive number, I think they are the best funded bitcoin start up ever.\nYup, more than the NYSE/BBVA one for $75mill.  Some how I get the feeling it's not garnering the press it deserves, but at least Barry is Retweeting it!!\nhttps://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/575294815560167425\n", "author": "ChuckBuck Hero Member Offline Activity: 840 Merit: 510 Vietnamese translator - https://goo.gl/Muc9xi "}, {"date": "2015-03-10 14:31:25", "content": "Very interesting.

Later, high-tech security company BitGo Inc. launched a unique insurance program, while the New York-based Digital Currency Groups Bitcoin Investment Trust earned regulatory approval to become the first publicly offered fund dedicated to owning bitcoin.\nWell-funded custodial and financial services companies Xapo Ltd. and Circle Internet Financial Ltd. have also developed high-tech security and insurance projects. Meanwhile, San Francisco startup BitFury Holding BV has launched new, high-powered chips to take bitcoin mining to a new level of intensity.\nNone of this will matter if bitcoin doesnt achieve mass adoption, says Mr. Pauker.\nBitcoin is going to change the way that people and businesses and even machines interact with each other, he says. But for bitcoin to realize that vision we need mass adoption. It cant just be for Silicon Valley.\nThis is great under the radar news, mainly because only the silicon valley giants really know what 21 is all about.\nKnowing that so many brilliant people and companies are supporting and investing in this secretive company is going to be truly ground breaking.\nCan't wait to see what type of smart appliances or gadgets 21 comes up with, that will get the masses flocking to get a peek at this new Bitcoin centric tech.\nAnd things continue as accorded by common sense (aka Bitcoin being a global success). Let the FUDsters drown in their own tears.\n", "author": "AtheistAKASaneBrain Hero Member Offline Activity: 770 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-03-10 17:20:19", "content": "Good if bitcoin gains big from them, but apparently they are also companies seeking for profit.

However I assured her I could still ridicule her taste in said drinks in a subtle yet disparaging way designed to heighten her insecurity to the point that she would seek sex with a middle-aged firefighter for validation.\nWell it turns out the sex wasn't all that great because she made me do all the work and then started crying even though I offered to give her half the bus fair to get back to her dorm. Freshmen are such a pain in the ass and I never have this problem with sorority chicks but I'm willing to take a risk on an underclassman if she has good qualities such as d-cup frost detectors. So anyway what was I writing about? Oh yeah:\nThe BLOCKCHAIN IS THE PERMANENT RECORD. ANYTHING WORTH RECORDING CAN AND EVENTUALLY WILL BE RECORDED THERE. That's what these mouth-breathing Luddites need to understand.\nLook at this beautiful video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O305BmU1VgQ\nThis right here should be self explanatory.

But when speaking over a crackling, transatlantic Skype line, they are nearly impossible to tell apart.\nThe twins are gearing up for the launch of their latest project, a super-secure Bitcoin exchange called \"Gemini,\" which they announced at the end of January. Created in 2008 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that does away with central banks in favour of user-to-user transactions. Tyler and Cameron became involved in the sphere since first learning about it in 2012 (while partying in Ibiza, they say); they claim to own at least 1% of all Bitcoin in existence, and they have also invested heavily in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nBitcoin is like a \"child taking its first steps,\" Tyler says, and the arrival of \"mature financial tools\" won't \"happen overnight.\" But Gemini is intended to be one of the first of these.\nGemini will be a fully regulated exchange through which ordinary members of the public  and institutions  can feel confident enough to buy and sell the digital currency without fear. Right now the world of Bitcoin is like the Wild West  exchanges come and go, often disappearing with everyone's money inside them. Gemini will be the antidote to that, the twins hope. They are touting it as the \"Nasdaq of Bitcoin.\"\nThey believe the digital currency  and institutions like Gemini  will one day dominate global finance.\nIt's an ambitious project, and it comes amid serious teething trouble for Bitcoin.\n", "views": 617, "author": "Mikestang Legendary Offline Activity: 1162 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin will come to dominate global finance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-03-10 17:13:27"}, {"content": "What place where I see cash is still better than BTC is offline transactions, AFAIK BTC doesn't work if the Blockchain is not synchronized.IS there a way to transact Bitcoins offline?\n", "views": 1596, "author": "mtwelve Legendary Offline Activity: 1092 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBItcoin offline transactions?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-02-11 20:09:30", "content": "Yes, you can exchange a paper wallet or coin wallet for goods or services.\nYou're correct in realizing, though, that the greatest weakness to Bitcoin is its dependency on the network (and more so power/electricity).

Back then, the price of Bitcoin was much higher ($700's) and there were a lot more new people entering the community compared to today.\nPassword protect your wallet. Or save your coins on some trusted exchanger site.\nSomeone else already mentioned inputs.io as an example of why it's not a good idea to store your coins on a third party exchange or wallet site and they are correct. There have been many other \"hacked\" online wallet services and exchanges in the past - the most famous being Mt. Gox which was trusted for many years. One of the first to be hacked was MyBitcoin which was a service that even Satoshi recommended (but only for small amounts). Recently, Bitstamp and Bter suffered major hacks too. I wouldn't feel safe having my coins stored on an exchange. For long term storage, offline or paper wallets are the best solution.\nNot only trojan but silent miners! That makes 99x PROFIT! Satoshi wont be happy with that\nIf satoshi's computer got infected...its over...hacker will probably take over Bitcoin\nSilent miners do not profit as much as before. To gain a viable hashrate, you need thousands of the most powerful and biggest hardware. GPU or CPU mining is dead long ago compared to ASIC.\nEven for someone with a botnet, it would be pointless trying to mine BTC using ordinary computers. The introduction of ASICs made the threat of botnet mining farms obsolete for Bitcoin. It would make much more sense for a botnet operator to silently mine a CPU or GPU mineable altcoin instead and then convert these coins to BTC via an exchange.\nPassword protect your wallet. Or save your coins on some trusted exchanger site.\nI'm curious, why on earth is a New Password requirement not part of the installation setup for every wallet in existence? I would think it should be automatic that whenever you install a wallet that it asks you to set up a password the first time you run it. The thought that people are downloading wallets and sending BTC to them and not realizing that anyone/anything accessing their PC can simply take the bitcoins, floors me.\nElectrum prompts for an (optional) password after installation so I'm not sure why Bitcoin Core doesn't. In fact, even the ability to encrypt the wallet in Bitcoin Core was a recent addition. Before late 2011, it was impossible to encrypt your wallet unless you used a third party tool. It wasn't until allinvain's 25,000 BTC hack (\nlink\n) in the same year that prompted the devs to add encryption.\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-03-09 05:42:54", "content": "A new report from security firm Symantec claims the number of Trojan malware programs targeting bitcoin users has fallen in the past year. they suggest that since the number of users of crypto is still low it is not a good target!\nit is a good news but i thought cryptocurrency was getting popular so as a result it will attract evil people too but seems not!\nsource:\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/symantec-bitcoin-financial-trojans/\nHmm..

Unless the trojan encrypted their files, they should be able to make a backup with no problem.\nUnfortunately, it sounds like his friend might have been infected with a variant of CryptoLocker:\nCryptoLocker was a ransomware trojan which targeted computers running Microsoft Windows, believed to have first been posted to the Internet on 5 September 2013. CryptoLocker propagated via infected email attachments, and via an existing botnet; when activated, the malware encrypts certain types of files stored on local and mounted network drives using RSA public-key cryptography, with the private key stored only on the malware's control servers. The malware then displays a message which offers to decrypt the data if a payment (through either Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher) is made by a stated deadline, and threatened to delete the private key if the deadline passes. If the deadline is not met, the malware offered to decrypt data via an online service provided by the malware's operators, for a significantly higher price in Bitcoin.\nAlthough CryptoLocker itself is readily removed, files remained encrypted in a way which researchers considered infeasible to break. Many said that the ransom should not be paid, but did not offer any way to recover files; others said that paying the ransom was the only way to recover files that had not been backed up. Some victims claimed that paying the ransom did not always lead to the files being decrypted.\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker\nIf the files aren't actually encrypted, then it should be possible to recover them by booting with Ubuntu. However, if they are actually encrypted then I don't think there is a way to decrypt it without paying the ransom. This is one of many reasons why it's so important to backup your data.\nEDIT: Wait, I found this. Seems to be a new development that could help your friend:\nAs part of the operation, the Dutch security firm Fox-IT was able to procure the database of private keys used by CryptoLocker; in August 2014, Fox-IT and fellow firm FireEye introduced an online service which allows infected users to retrieve their private key by uploading a sample file, and then receive a decryption tool.\nLink to the service:\nhttp://www.decryptcryptolocker.com/\nPassword protect your wallet. Or save your coins on some trusted exchanger site.\nThe saving coins method is flawed. Everyone said inputs.io was legit and looked what happen\n.\nOne acid test of whether an exchanger should be \"trusted\" is if they have EVER accepted a bribe, or even openly charged a fee, to list an altcoin.  It's not the only test you should be looking at but it's definitely one of them.\nIf they are already known to be corrupt, don't trust them with your bitcoin keys.\nI don't think I've ever heard of an altcoin exchange charging listing fees before but I do know that many legitimate exchanges have paid voting for adding new altcoins where each vote costs a certain fee. In the end, the coins with the most number of votes get added. They get a lot of revenue from these votes so I don't see why a listing fee would be required.\nAnd inputs.io wasn't an exchange anyway. It was an online wallet service similar to MyBitcoin that allowed for off-blockchain transactions.\nAnd really, no exchanges should be \"trusted\" for storing anything more than pocket change either. If someone is a day trader who must store their coins on an exchange, then they should understand that part of the risk of day trading is that the exchange could go under. Mt. Gox was a highly trustworthy exchange for many years until it imploded. Bter was a respected exchange too but they were hacked twice. Poloniex was hacked too. Same with Bitstamp. No amount of respect or trustworthiness can protect against the possibility of hacks.\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-03-10 05:37:34", "content": "as long as your btc are in a cold storage, malware/trojan cannot do anything\notherwise dedicate a network and a desktop exclusively to your bitcoin client, and don't surf or DL nothing on that machine, 100% safe, unless a real thief enter your house, but that's another story....\nThere is no need to dedicate a whole computer for that, you can much more easily create a virtual machine with all your wallets and rest of stuff u need to protect and store it on a usb drive.\nWould make much more sence than having a separate computer just to hold your wallet on it.\ncheers\nvirtual machine share the same network, it won't be 100% safe, i read that there are exploit to by pass virtual machine protection, strong malware/virus can do it\nthe point is to have a completely separate network\nnot necessarily. you can easily not define any network for the virtual machine so that it works as a computer with only minimum requrements like CPU, CD, and HDD and nothing more.\n", "author": "pooya87 Legendary Offline Activity: 1400 Merit: 1158 Buy bitcoin they said... who listened?

There would be no point mining bitcoins because even the best computers are no match for ASICs. This has been true since 2013.\nAs for the torrent application, what you are probably thinking about is uTorrent. The latest version of uTorrent added a program called Epic Scale that uses your CPU to perform computing tasks in the background while it is not in use - one of these tasks being cryptocurrency mining. The cryptocurrency in this case was not Bitcoin but a related coin called Litecoin. Installing Epic Scale was technically optional as you could choose to opt out during the installation process although the installer was written in a way that made it easy to overlook this option.\nCan a bitcoin mining virus make a profit today? Actually, yes, it can. But it would make much more sense to channel the computing power into mining altcoins instead. I wrote a detailed analysis of how much profit 1 million infected computers can make\nhere\nwhich I've reposted below:\nAssuming it could be written and not detected. It would pull either part of the cpu or part of the discrete gpu.\nneither part does a lot of hashing.  Say you bleed 10 percent of the cpu or gpu.  maybe 50mh a pc so 20 pc's for 1 gh.\n2000 pc's for 1th\n2,000,000 pc's for 1ph.\nnot much more can be bleed off without detection.\nSo is it possible to make a virus that infects 2mill pc's sure.  and if you are never caught you hash at 1ph. my guess is it would be found out quickly. since all the pc's would be dedicating a decent amount of cpu/gpu/watts to the mining.\nIf 20 PCs equal 1 GH/s then wouldn't you need 20,000 PCs for 1 TH/s and 20,000,000 PCs for 1 PH/s?\nAnyway, both Bitcoin mining viruses and non-SHA-256 altcoin mining viruses would be profitable (it is free electricity, after all). A 1 million PC botnet where each PC is capable of 50 MH/s would have a total hashpower of about 50 million MH/s or 50 TH/s. At the current difficulty, the botnet operator would get a reasonable-ish passive profit of $150* per day according to\nCoinwarz\n.\nHowever, the botnet operator could earn much more than this if he chose to mine CPU and GPU mineable altcoins instead. If he mined Darkcoin and we assume that each PC has 3 MH/s of X11 hashing power, he would get $75,000** per day!\nViruses that mine scrypt-based currencies would fall somewhere in the middle as they have ASICs built for them but the performance difference between ASIC mining and GPU mining is not as extreme as SHA-256.\n*If the miner only mined at 10% max performance to prevent the PC owners from finding out, it would only bring in $15 a day.\n**Again, if the miner only mined at 10% max performance, it would bring in $7,500 a day. I'm not sure if this is practically feasible though since dumping that many coins on an exchange every single day would depress the price and surely the exchange owners will find out?\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-03-10 10:11:52", "content": "Trojans are targeting your computers to mine bitcoins.

Installing Epic Scale was technically optional as you could choose to opt out during the installation process although the installer was written in a way that made it easy to overlook this option.\nCan a bitcoin mining virus make a profit today? Actually, yes, it can. But it would make much more sense to channel the computing power into mining altcoins instead. I wrote a detailed analysis of how much profit 1 million infected computers can make\nhere\nwhich I've reposted below:\nAssuming it could be written and not detected. It would pull either part of the cpu or part of the discrete gpu.\nneither part does a lot of hashing.  Say you bleed 10 percent of the cpu or gpu.  maybe 50mh a pc so 20 pc's for 1 gh.\n2000 pc's for 1th\n2,000,000 pc's for 1ph.\nnot much more can be bleed off without detection.\nSo is it possible to make a virus that infects 2mill pc's sure.  and if you are never caught you hash at 1ph. my guess is it would be found out quickly. since all the pc's would be dedicating a decent amount of cpu/gpu/watts to the mining.\nIf 20 PCs equal 1 GH/s then wouldn't you need 20,000 PCs for 1 TH/s and 20,000,000 PCs for 1 PH/s?\nAnyway, both Bitcoin mining viruses and non-SHA-256 altcoin mining viruses would be profitable (it is free electricity, after all). A 1 million PC botnet where each PC is capable of 50 MH/s would have a total hashpower of about 50 million MH/s or 50 TH/s. At the current difficulty, the botnet operator would get a reasonable-ish passive profit of $150* per day according to\nCoinwarz\n.\nHowever, the botnet operator could earn much more than this if he chose to mine CPU and GPU mineable altcoins instead. If he mined Darkcoin and we assume that each PC has 3 MH/s of X11 hashing power, he would get $75,000** per day!\nViruses that mine scrypt-based currencies would fall somewhere in the middle as they have ASICs built for them but the performance difference between ASIC mining and GPU mining is not as extreme as SHA-256.\n*If the miner only mined at 10% max performance to prevent the PC owners from finding out, it would only bring in $15 a day.\n**Again, if the miner only mined at 10% max performance, it would bring in $7,500 a day. I'm not sure if this is practically feasible though since dumping that many coins on an exchange every single day would depress the price and surely the exchange owners will find out?\nVery interresting link.. thanks.\nI think the downward trend, was based on the small gains, received from Bitcoin trojan's and people should be made aware that alt coins are also mined from trojan infected machines.\nIf someone download a \"FREE\" / \"Pirated\" game from torrent sites, they should expect a little bonus trojan too. {Free is seldom FREE from virusses or trojan's}\nThere are many people who still think, it's OK.... so a little bonus, is OK too.\nImagine if the company, who owned the game, had a way to determine, who pirated their game and instead of disabling it, they could enable a trojan like this and mine for Alt's from that persons CPU/GPU until they received the amount that the user stole from them. {Sounds like a good idea to me}\n", "author": "Kprawn Legendary Offline Activity: 1610 Merit: 1048 Make winning bets on sports with Sportsbet.io!

Too early for them to think about investing, they might buy a few to have a look at how it works and gambling.\n4) Ages 26-40 is my pick because these are the true investors, they are neither too young, nor too old. They are ripe for investing in Bitcoin and will also use Bitcoin in their daily life. Also, they will use Bitcoin for gambling and for purchases. They are generally financially secure at this point and could travel a bit where they would use Bitcoin.\nThe view expressed above may not be agreed upon by all, but this is my opinion.

But amid stories of scandal, theft and turbulent prices, the general public has largely ignored the arguments of vocal supporters, who tout the digital currencys potential to cut costs by removing middlemen from finance and commerce.\nAccording to Silicon Valley investors such as those taking stakes in 21, say that failure to gain mass adoption is partly because the publics attention has been misguidedly focused on bitcoins limited potential as a digital alternative to traditional currencies. In reality, they say, its underlying technology has far wider applications than that. Unlike the currency transactions that are generally associated with bitcoin, these new uses could range from lawyer-free smart contracts to tamper-proof online voting systems.\n21s lead investors include U.S. venture-capital heavyweights Andreessen Horowitz and RRE Ventures, along with Chinese private-equity firm Yuan Capital, with a strategic stake going to chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.QCOM +0.49% through its venture-capital unit.\nAdditionally, Khosla Ventures and Data Collective have invested in 21, as well as chief executives and founders from various tech companies, including PayPal co-founders Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, eBay Inc. co-founder Jeff Skoll, Dropbox Inc. CEO Drew Houston, Expedia Inc. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Zynga Inc. co-founder Mark Pincus.\nMr. Pauker said Qualcomms involvement is key. He hopes to exploit the Bridgewater, N.J., chipmakers mass-marketing and production capabilities in the development of a suite of consumer products that integrate with bitcoins core technology called the blockchain. This technology takes the form of a public, digital ledger thats maintained by a decentralized network of thousands of independently owned computers.\nQualcomms involvement could spur speculation that 21 has its sights on the so-called Internet of Things. Thats the idea that a myriad of smart, Internet-connected appliances will in the future communicate with servers, networks and each other to optimize their operation, maintenance and energy usage without direct human involvement.\nSome developers believe that bitcoin technology could play a key role in transparently managing the vast flow of information generated by these smart gadgets. The decentralized blockchain ledgers are free from the control of any one party, so smart appliances can in theory connect with computers built by other entities safely without worrying that the information was manipulated.\nStarting out under the earlier name of 21e6, the company  which takes its name from the 21-million limit that bitcoins managing algorithm imposes on the total number of bitcoins to be released  spurred intense speculation in November 2013, when a regulatory filing revealed a $5 million fundraise.\nMembers of the bitcoin community speculated about a secret vehicle for Silicon Valley elites to develop high-powered equipment that could dominate bitcoin mining. Mr. Paukers comments about a consumer focus suggest that isnt where the company has ended up.\nThe initial secrecy around 21 was solely for pragmatic reasons  we didnt have anything to say to the world,  says co-founder Balaji Srinivasan, who is also a partner at Andreessen Horowitz. He compares 21s work in building bitcoin products for the general public to the sequential development of 56-kilobit Internet modems, international fiber cables and wireless Internet towers, which all helped bring the Internet into peoples homes in the late 1990s.\nThis notion also has parallels with the mass Internet appeal achieved in the 1990s by the development of the Netscape browser by Marc Andreessen, a co-founder of Mr. Srinivasans firm. Asked for his views on 21, Mr. Andreessen said it is working on what they  and we  consider to be core infrastructure for mainstreaming bitcoin.\n21s announcement extends this years upswing in venture capitalists digital-currency investments, highlighted by Januarys $75 million fundraising for San Francisco-based bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase Inc., whose investors include the New York Stock Exchange. Bitcoin-focused venture capital more than tripled to $347 million in 2014 from a year earlier, according Coindesk.\nThe money flow is paving the way for products and services aimed at transitioning bitcoin from its volatile, Wild West beginnings into an era of more secure infrastructure and mass appeal.\nA week after its funding announcement, Coinbase unveiled the first licensed U.S bitcoin currency exchange. Later, high-tech security company BitGo Inc. launched a unique insurance program, while the New York-based Digital Currency Groups Bitcoin Investment Trust earned regulatory approval to become the first publicly offered fund dedicated to owning bitcoin.\nWell-funded custodial and financial services companies Xapo Ltd. and Circle Internet Financial Ltd. have also developed high-tech security and insurance projects. Meanwhile, San Francisco startup BitFury Holding BV has launched new, high-powered chips to take bitcoin mining to a new level of intensity.\nNone of this will matter if bitcoin doesnt achieve mass adoption, says Mr. Pauker.\nBitcoin is going to change the way that people and businesses and even machines interact with each other, he says. But for bitcoin to realize that vision we need mass adoption. It cant just be for Silicon Valley.\nThis is great under the radar news, mainly because only the silicon valley giants really know what 21 is all about.\nKnowing that so many brilliant people and companies are supporting and investing in this secretive company is going to be truly ground breaking.\nCan't wait to see what type of smart appliances or gadgets 21 comes up with, that will get the masses flocking to get a peek at this new Bitcoin centric tech.\n", "views": 3364, "author": "ChuckBuck Hero Member Offline Activity: 840 Merit: 510 Vietnamese translator - https://goo.gl/Muc9xi ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin Startup 21 raises record funding $116 mill, aims at mainstreaming BTC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-03-10 14:24:55", "content": "$116 million is an impressive number, I think they are the best funded bitcoin start up ever.\n", "author": "L Full Member Offline Activity: 182 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-03-10 14:29:01", "content": "$116 million is an impressive number, I think they are the best funded bitcoin start up ever.\nYup, more than the NYSE/BBVA one for $75mill.  Some how I get the feeling it's not garnering the press it deserves, but at least Barry is Retweeting it!!\nhttps://twitter.com/barrysilbert/status/575294815560167425\n", "author": "ChuckBuck Hero Member Offline Activity: 840 Merit: 510 Vietnamese translator - https://goo.gl/Muc9xi "}, {"date": "2015-03-10 14:31:25", "content": "Very interesting.

But when speaking over a crackling, transatlantic Skype line, they are nearly impossible to tell apart.\nThe twins are gearing up for the launch of their latest project, a super-secure Bitcoin exchange called \"Gemini,\" which they announced at the end of January. Created in 2008 by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency that does away with central banks in favour of user-to-user transactions. Tyler and Cameron became involved in the sphere since first learning about it in 2012 (while partying in Ibiza, they say); they claim to own at least 1% of all Bitcoin in existence, and they have also invested heavily in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\nBitcoin is like a \"child taking its first steps,\" Tyler says, and the arrival of \"mature financial tools\" won't \"happen overnight.\" But Gemini is intended to be one of the first of these.\nGemini will be a fully regulated exchange through which ordinary members of the public  and institutions  can feel confident enough to buy and sell the digital currency without fear. Right now the world of Bitcoin is like the Wild West  exchanges come and go, often disappearing with everyone's money inside them. Gemini will be the antidote to that, the twins hope. They are touting it as the \"Nasdaq of Bitcoin.\"\nThey believe the digital currency  and institutions like Gemini  will one day dominate global finance.\nIt's an ambitious project, and it comes amid serious teething trouble for Bitcoin.\n", "views": 617, "author": "Mikestang Legendary Offline Activity: 1162 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin will come to dominate global finance\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-03-10 17:13:27"}, {"content": "What place where I see cash is still better than BTC is offline transactions, AFAIK BTC doesn't work if the Blockchain is not synchronized.IS there a way to transact Bitcoins offline?\n", "views": 1596, "author": "mtwelve Legendary Offline Activity: 1092 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBItcoin offline transactions?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-02-11 20:09:30", "content": "Yes, you can exchange a paper wallet or coin wallet for goods or services.\nYou're correct in realizing, though, that the greatest weakness to Bitcoin is its dependency on the network (and more so power/electricity).

Back then, the price of Bitcoin was much higher ($700's) and there were a lot more new people entering the community compared to today.\nPassword protect your wallet. Or save your coins on some trusted exchanger site.\nSomeone else already mentioned inputs.io as an example of why it's not a good idea to store your coins on a third party exchange or wallet site and they are correct. There have been many other \"hacked\" online wallet services and exchanges in the past - the most famous being Mt. Gox which was trusted for many years. One of the first to be hacked was MyBitcoin which was a service that even Satoshi recommended (but only for small amounts). Recently, Bitstamp and Bter suffered major hacks too. I wouldn't feel safe having my coins stored on an exchange. For long term storage, offline or paper wallets are the best solution.\nNot only trojan but silent miners! That makes 99x PROFIT! Satoshi wont be happy with that\nIf satoshi's computer got infected...its over...hacker will probably take over Bitcoin\nSilent miners do not profit as much as before. To gain a viable hashrate, you need thousands of the most powerful and biggest hardware. GPU or CPU mining is dead long ago compared to ASIC.\nEven for someone with a botnet, it would be pointless trying to mine BTC using ordinary computers. The introduction of ASICs made the threat of botnet mining farms obsolete for Bitcoin. It would make much more sense for a botnet operator to silently mine a CPU or GPU mineable altcoin instead and then convert these coins to BTC via an exchange.\nPassword protect your wallet. Or save your coins on some trusted exchanger site.\nI'm curious, why on earth is a New Password requirement not part of the installation setup for every wallet in existence? I would think it should be automatic that whenever you install a wallet that it asks you to set up a password the first time you run it. The thought that people are downloading wallets and sending BTC to them and not realizing that anyone/anything accessing their PC can simply take the bitcoins, floors me.\nElectrum prompts for an (optional) password after installation so I'm not sure why Bitcoin Core doesn't. In fact, even the ability to encrypt the wallet in Bitcoin Core was a recent addition. Before late 2011, it was impossible to encrypt your wallet unless you used a third party tool. It wasn't until allinvain's 25,000 BTC hack (\nlink\n) in the same year that prompted the devs to add encryption.\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-03-09 05:42:54", "content": "A new report from security firm Symantec claims the number of Trojan malware programs targeting bitcoin users has fallen in the past year. they suggest that since the number of users of crypto is still low it is not a good target!\nit is a good news but i thought cryptocurrency was getting popular so as a result it will attract evil people too but seems not!\nsource:\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/symantec-bitcoin-financial-trojans/\nHmm..

Unless the trojan encrypted their files, they should be able to make a backup with no problem.\nUnfortunately, it sounds like his friend might have been infected with a variant of CryptoLocker:\nCryptoLocker was a ransomware trojan which targeted computers running Microsoft Windows, believed to have first been posted to the Internet on 5 September 2013. CryptoLocker propagated via infected email attachments, and via an existing botnet; when activated, the malware encrypts certain types of files stored on local and mounted network drives using RSA public-key cryptography, with the private key stored only on the malware's control servers. The malware then displays a message which offers to decrypt the data if a payment (through either Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher) is made by a stated deadline, and threatened to delete the private key if the deadline passes. If the deadline is not met, the malware offered to decrypt data via an online service provided by the malware's operators, for a significantly higher price in Bitcoin.\nAlthough CryptoLocker itself is readily removed, files remained encrypted in a way which researchers considered infeasible to break. Many said that the ransom should not be paid, but did not offer any way to recover files; others said that paying the ransom was the only way to recover files that had not been backed up. Some victims claimed that paying the ransom did not always lead to the files being decrypted.\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker\nIf the files aren't actually encrypted, then it should be possible to recover them by booting with Ubuntu. However, if they are actually encrypted then I don't think there is a way to decrypt it without paying the ransom. This is one of many reasons why it's so important to backup your data.\nEDIT: Wait, I found this. Seems to be a new development that could help your friend:\nAs part of the operation, the Dutch security firm Fox-IT was able to procure the database of private keys used by CryptoLocker; in August 2014, Fox-IT and fellow firm FireEye introduced an online service which allows infected users to retrieve their private key by uploading a sample file, and then receive a decryption tool.\nLink to the service:\nhttp://www.decryptcryptolocker.com/\nPassword protect your wallet. Or save your coins on some trusted exchanger site.\nThe saving coins method is flawed. Everyone said inputs.io was legit and looked what happen\n.\nOne acid test of whether an exchanger should be \"trusted\" is if they have EVER accepted a bribe, or even openly charged a fee, to list an altcoin.  It's not the only test you should be looking at but it's definitely one of them.\nIf they are already known to be corrupt, don't trust them with your bitcoin keys.\nI don't think I've ever heard of an altcoin exchange charging listing fees before but I do know that many legitimate exchanges have paid voting for adding new altcoins where each vote costs a certain fee. In the end, the coins with the most number of votes get added. They get a lot of revenue from these votes so I don't see why a listing fee would be required.\nAnd inputs.io wasn't an exchange anyway. It was an online wallet service similar to MyBitcoin that allowed for off-blockchain transactions.\nAnd really, no exchanges should be \"trusted\" for storing anything more than pocket change either. If someone is a day trader who must store their coins on an exchange, then they should understand that part of the risk of day trading is that the exchange could go under. Mt. Gox was a highly trustworthy exchange for many years until it imploded. Bter was a respected exchange too but they were hacked twice. Poloniex was hacked too. Same with Bitstamp. No amount of respect or trustworthiness can protect against the possibility of hacks.\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-03-10 05:37:34", "content": "as long as your btc are in a cold storage, malware/trojan cannot do anything\notherwise dedicate a network and a desktop exclusively to your bitcoin client, and don't surf or DL nothing on that machine, 100% safe, unless a real thief enter your house, but that's another story....\nThere is no need to dedicate a whole computer for that, you can much more easily create a virtual machine with all your wallets and rest of stuff u need to protect and store it on a usb drive.\nWould make much more sence than having a separate computer just to hold your wallet on it.\ncheers\nvirtual machine share the same network, it won't be 100% safe, i read that there are exploit to by pass virtual machine protection, strong malware/virus can do it\nthe point is to have a completely separate network\nnot necessarily. you can easily not define any network for the virtual machine so that it works as a computer with only minimum requrements like CPU, CD, and HDD and nothing more.\n", "author": "pooya87 Legendary Offline Activity: 1400 Merit: 1158 Buy bitcoin they said... who listened?

There would be no point mining bitcoins because even the best computers are no match for ASICs. This has been true since 2013.\nAs for the torrent application, what you are probably thinking about is uTorrent. The latest version of uTorrent added a program called Epic Scale that uses your CPU to perform computing tasks in the background while it is not in use - one of these tasks being cryptocurrency mining. The cryptocurrency in this case was not Bitcoin but a related coin called Litecoin. Installing Epic Scale was technically optional as you could choose to opt out during the installation process although the installer was written in a way that made it easy to overlook this option.\nCan a bitcoin mining virus make a profit today? Actually, yes, it can. But it would make much more sense to channel the computing power into mining altcoins instead. I wrote a detailed analysis of how much profit 1 million infected computers can make\nhere\nwhich I've reposted below:\nAssuming it could be written and not detected. It would pull either part of the cpu or part of the discrete gpu.\nneither part does a lot of hashing.  Say you bleed 10 percent of the cpu or gpu.  maybe 50mh a pc so 20 pc's for 1 gh.\n2000 pc's for 1th\n2,000,000 pc's for 1ph.\nnot much more can be bleed off without detection.\nSo is it possible to make a virus that infects 2mill pc's sure.  and if you are never caught you hash at 1ph. my guess is it would be found out quickly. since all the pc's would be dedicating a decent amount of cpu/gpu/watts to the mining.\nIf 20 PCs equal 1 GH/s then wouldn't you need 20,000 PCs for 1 TH/s and 20,000,000 PCs for 1 PH/s?\nAnyway, both Bitcoin mining viruses and non-SHA-256 altcoin mining viruses would be profitable (it is free electricity, after all). A 1 million PC botnet where each PC is capable of 50 MH/s would have a total hashpower of about 50 million MH/s or 50 TH/s. At the current difficulty, the botnet operator would get a reasonable-ish passive profit of $150* per day according to\nCoinwarz\n.\nHowever, the botnet operator could earn much more than this if he chose to mine CPU and GPU mineable altcoins instead. If he mined Darkcoin and we assume that each PC has 3 MH/s of X11 hashing power, he would get $75,000** per day!\nViruses that mine scrypt-based currencies would fall somewhere in the middle as they have ASICs built for them but the performance difference between ASIC mining and GPU mining is not as extreme as SHA-256.\n*If the miner only mined at 10% max performance to prevent the PC owners from finding out, it would only bring in $15 a day.\n**Again, if the miner only mined at 10% max performance, it would bring in $7,500 a day. I'm not sure if this is practically feasible though since dumping that many coins on an exchange every single day would depress the price and surely the exchange owners will find out?\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-03-10 10:11:52", "content": "Trojans are targeting your computers to mine bitcoins.

Installing Epic Scale was technically optional as you could choose to opt out during the installation process although the installer was written in a way that made it easy to overlook this option.\nCan a bitcoin mining virus make a profit today? Actually, yes, it can. But it would make much more sense to channel the computing power into mining altcoins instead. I wrote a detailed analysis of how much profit 1 million infected computers can make\nhere\nwhich I've reposted below:\nAssuming it could be written and not detected. It would pull either part of the cpu or part of the discrete gpu.\nneither part does a lot of hashing.  Say you bleed 10 percent of the cpu or gpu.  maybe 50mh a pc so 20 pc's for 1 gh.\n2000 pc's for 1th\n2,000,000 pc's for 1ph.\nnot much more can be bleed off without detection.\nSo is it possible to make a virus that infects 2mill pc's sure.  and if you are never caught you hash at 1ph. my guess is it would be found out quickly. since all the pc's would be dedicating a decent amount of cpu/gpu/watts to the mining.\nIf 20 PCs equal 1 GH/s then wouldn't you need 20,000 PCs for 1 TH/s and 20,000,000 PCs for 1 PH/s?\nAnyway, both Bitcoin mining viruses and non-SHA-256 altcoin mining viruses would be profitable (it is free electricity, after all). A 1 million PC botnet where each PC is capable of 50 MH/s would have a total hashpower of about 50 million MH/s or 50 TH/s. At the current difficulty, the botnet operator would get a reasonable-ish passive profit of $150* per day according to\nCoinwarz\n.\nHowever, the botnet operator could earn much more than this if he chose to mine CPU and GPU mineable altcoins instead. If he mined Darkcoin and we assume that each PC has 3 MH/s of X11 hashing power, he would get $75,000** per day!\nViruses that mine scrypt-based currencies would fall somewhere in the middle as they have ASICs built for them but the performance difference between ASIC mining and GPU mining is not as extreme as SHA-256.\n*If the miner only mined at 10% max performance to prevent the PC owners from finding out, it would only bring in $15 a day.\n**Again, if the miner only mined at 10% max performance, it would bring in $7,500 a day. I'm not sure if this is practically feasible though since dumping that many coins on an exchange every single day would depress the price and surely the exchange owners will find out?\nVery interresting link.. thanks.\nI think the downward trend, was based on the small gains, received from Bitcoin trojan's and people should be made aware that alt coins are also mined from trojan infected machines.\nIf someone download a \"FREE\" / \"Pirated\" game from torrent sites, they should expect a little bonus trojan too. {Free is seldom FREE from virusses or trojan's}\nThere are many people who still think, it's OK.... so a little bonus, is OK too.\nImagine if the company, who owned the game, had a way to determine, who pirated their game and instead of disabling it, they could enable a trojan like this and mine for Alt's from that persons CPU/GPU until they received the amount that the user stole from them. {Sounds like a good idea to me}\n", "author": "Kprawn Legendary Offline Activity: 1610 Merit: 1048 Make winning bets on sports with Sportsbet.io!

Too early for them to think about investing, they might buy a few to have a look at how it works and gambling.\n4) Ages 26-40 is my pick because these are the true investors, they are neither too young, nor too old. They are ripe for investing in Bitcoin and will also use Bitcoin in their daily life. Also, they will use Bitcoin for gambling and for purchases. They are generally financially secure at this point and could travel a bit where they would use Bitcoin.\nThe view expressed above may not be agreed upon by all, but this is my opinion.
