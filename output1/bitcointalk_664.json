Indeed, bitcoin relies on a P2P network of computers to proceed money transfers. Each part of the network works to create new bitcoins (mining), keep the network alive and validate transactions.\nAll the transactions are registered in the blockchain that is used to validate a transaction using cryptography technology: it ensures that you cant use a bitcoin you dont own or you dont use the same bitcoin more than once. This last action previously required a third party, but with bitcoin this is not the case anymore: the network replaces financial institutions and banks.\nThen, money transfers are almost in real time as the network is responsible for validating transactions. Currently you need only 10 minutes to get your money transfer approved.\nAs there is no third party the transfer is almost free. Miners are the only ones to be rewarded to issue new bitcoins. They also collect fees to integrate a new transaction into the blockchain, then validate a transfer. Currently a typical fee costs 0.0001 bitcoin (BTC) per transaction.\nThe remittance market is huge and moving swiftly to digital\nRemittance was a $582 billion market in 2014 according to the World Bank. Most of all it is dominated by transfers from developed countries to developing ones. In 2014, China received $64 billion through remittance and India $71 billion. Philippines received $25 billion, Mexico $22 billion, Nigeria $21 billion, Egypt $17 billion and Vietnam $11 billion in 2013.\nSo far most transactions are made through brick and mortar networks; in 2014 only 5% were digital transactions. These networks like Western Union or MoneyGram charge high fees to finance their deep local presence worldwide. A typical money transfer costs up to 10% fees.\nBut as mobile phones are spreading across the world, even in emerging countries, money transfers are shifting to digital. And mobile/digital remittance services are booming as they offer reduced fees mainly thanks to lower-fixed costs (maintaining a mobile app is much cheaper than operating a retail network).\nMost of the digital remittance operators claim they are at least 45% cheaper than physical networks. Some of these new companies are operating under a P2P model: connecting buyers and sellers to arrange currency exchanges.\nBitcoin allows several operating models\nEven through digital, remittance remains deeply dependent on third parties: banks are still validating money transfers from senders to the remittance operator and again to recipients.\nThen Bitcoin could even lower fees thanks to its decentralized network and through three different operating models that could be shaped:\nFull bitcoin: The sender owns bitcoins he sends to the recipient who can directly use them. This requires the owner to get bitcoin, which is easy in developed countries thanks to e-wallets and exchange platforms like Coinbase in the U.S. But it also requires the recipient either to be able to exchange them in fiat currency or to use bitcoins to pay for goods or services which is not that easy so far.\nFrom bitcoin to fiat currency: The sender have an easy access to bitcoins he sends to the remittance operator that sends fiat to the recipient. This model considers developing countries have an easy access to bitcoins wallets but paying with bitcoins is very limited especially in developing countries.\nFrom fiat currency to fiat currency: The sender pays its local money to the remittance operator that sends fiat to the recipient, using bitcoins to transfer money from one currency to another.\nA few startups are already operating on the bitcoin/remittance market\nEven at the early beginning this market has already attracted entrepreneurs and investors.\nThough far from Transferwise, a mobile remittance company that has a valuation over $1 billion and uses a P2P model to facilitate easy money transfers and currency exchanges, BitPesa has recently raised $1.1 million to ease bitcoins transfer from the UK to Africa.\nAbra raised a seed round and launched its service a few weeks ago in San-Francisco to ease money transfers based both on P2P and bitcoin technologies.\nIn emerging countries, Rebit is developing its remittance service to send money to the Philippines through bitcoin, ArtaBit develops a service to Indonesia and Coincove to Latin America.\nRisks and threats\nWhereas bitcoin is an open-source technology, it has long been regulated and constrained by banks and states. Because it relies on a P2P network to operate, bitcoin is seen as a threat to financial markets and states. Based on a combination of public and private key the technology is seen as an anonymous way to transfer money then easing traffic and money whitening. Then, for instance China forbids Chineses financial institutions from handling bitcoin transactions.\nCompanies that are operating bitcoin transfers also need to get a regulation approval to operate in developed markets as financial institutions request every actor to confirm it operates under transparent processes.\nThe bitcoin currency has also been very volatile, as its value moved from a few dollars for 1BTC at inception to over $1,000 for 1BTC at the end of 2013 and is now around $230 for 1BTC. This is a threat for bitcoin/remittance operators as they need to be very quick at exchanging currencies to make sure they will not keep bitcoins for a too long time. Protecting against currency exchange rates is the main issue for these companies.\nSecurity is another issue for the Bitcoin industry as a few platforms have been hacked and bitcoin wallets have been closed making millions of BTC disappear without any counterpart for their owners. Then bitcoin/remittance companies need to ensure customers they will not lose the money they upload on their platforms.\nFinally, bitcoin technology has a lot of property to attract digital remittance operators, starting with its decentralized technology, and some money has been invested in this market as the remittance industry is quickly shifting to digital. Bitcoin also seems to have been introduced to manage remittance to developing countries thanks to it low-cost operating structure, especially as a lot of money is currently lost in fees along the remittance process.\nFEATURED IMAGE: MIKE LEWINSKI/FLICKR UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE\nread on here :\nhttp://techcrunch.com/2015/05/25/bitcoin-might-be-the-next-big-thing-in-the-remittance-market/\n", "author": "ummina Member Offline Activity: 70 Merit: 10 ★777Coin.com★ Fun BTC Casino!

The company was told by the partner that attendees would possibly include Londons Metropolitan Police, the governments Home Office, domestic intelligence agency MI5, customs officials, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, and others.\nAfter this meeting, in September 2013, the London police force told Hacking Team that it was now ready to progress with a trial of the spying tool. In December the same year it then invited Hacking Team to formally submit a bid for a spy technology contract. A confidential document outlined that the force wanted to obtain Software that can be covertly introduced to a third parties device and will allow us to Look, Listen and Follow the third party. The Authority will receive, record and playback the Product retrieved from the third party on a System that shall be scalable, using proven technology that has in-built security measures appropriate to this task.\nBut the deal with the London cops, worth £385,000 ($591,000) to Hacking Team, was abruptly halted in in May 2014 following internal reviews on how we wished to move this area of technology forward, according to an email from the police, although the force left the door open for a future deal, adding: Of course in the months/years to come this could change and if that is the case then we would welcome your organizations participation.\nSince then, Hacking Team has continued to try to crack the U.K. market. It tried  and apparently failed  to set up a deal with Staffordshire Police after an officer contacted the company seeking technology to access WiFi points to check users and to infect devices to covertly collect data.\nHacking Team discussed whether it could sell its technology disguised under a different name, hiding its full functionality.\nAnd in January this year it began negotiating a contract with the British National Crime Agency. The meeting was a success, with an officer for the agency telling Hacking Team that a demonstration of the covert surveillance technology was extremely well received and proved to be a real eye opener for what can be achieved.\nIn April, the same officer told Hacking Team he wanted a quote for basic spyware that would log keystrokes, noting that he could then grow the system accordingly as we would then have the base platform. Hacking Team was interested in this proposal and discussed internally whether it could sell its technology disguised under a different name, hiding its full functionality. The deal appears to have since stalled, with the British agency telling Hacking Team in late May it was unable to arrange a meeting.\nThis doesn't mean, that the UK doesn't use illegal surveillance software btw. They only didn't want to buy the one from Hacking Team at this time.\n", "author": "AGD Legendary Offline Activity: 1680 Merit: 1025 HODLER SINCE 2013 "}, {"date": "2015-07-10 16:44:10", "content": "Just the tip of the iceberg in fact.\n-\nhttps://surveillance.rsf.org/en/\n\" On 12 March 2013, Reporters Without Borders published a Special report on Internet Surveillance... a list of \"Corporate Enemies of the Internet\", companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information. \"\n\" The five\n\"Corporate Enemies of the Internet\"\nnamed in March 2013 are:\nAmesys\n(France),\nBlue Coat Systems\n(U.S.),\nGamma\n(UK and Germany),\nHacking Team\n(Italy), and\nTrovicor\n(Germany). \"\n-snip-\nExactly.

I doubt that a lot of people know about these groups.\nThis just shows how corrupt our governments are.

Sometimes it is 10000 satoshi per kb to guarantee a faster confirmation. Also, another thing that prevents data from being stored is the block size limit.

If we take cryptograffiti[1] as a reference 2,000 bytes cost 0.00144600 BTC according to their preview. A ASCII picture like this costs ~0.03[2,3]. The limit on the costs is for one the fees needed for a TX and the max blocksize, but also that you need to burn bitcoin to an output that you will not be able to spend at a later date as its representing your data. There might be someday someone with the matching private key but the chances for that are as good as impossible.\nCode:\n``````\n`  `     ,.`   `.   ``\n`     `   `.,,`,,'+';  ``,```  `\n`            ,'++''';++''''':'''';+;,:,,..     `     `.\n`   .+;+'++++:;''';::;'''+;:;''',''. `.`  `.`       `\n. ,,:+'';:;;:;+';;';;;;'::;;;+:;;:++;.'':,`,:.``.,`\n`              ..`;.+'';:'++''';;;;'''';;:;;;:,;;;',;'';+;;;';::,.``.`.  `` `      `\n.  .:.++';+''#++++''+'+;;+''+';;;;;:::;;;;:;';';';;;;'+::,::````` `\n`    `  ,`,.++''''++++#++''++++'++''''';''';;:::;:::;;;,;;;:'';;;';,::;;.`  .`     `\n,`,:.+;;+'++'+'+''++'''';;;;;'';+:;:;;'';;;;;::::,,:;:;;:;'';;,;;;,;;..,,:..``\n,;:''+##'++;'+'';';;''';';;;;;;;'::::;:;:;;''':;'::,;,,;,:::;;:,;,::;;;:';

If we take cryptograffiti[1] as a reference 2,000 bytes cost 0.00144600 BTC according to their preview. A ASCII picture like this costs ~0.03[2,3]. The limit on the costs is for one the fees needed for a TX and the max blocksize, but also that you need to burn bitcoin to an output that you will not be able to spend at a later date as its representing your data. There might be someday someone with the matching private key but the chances for that are as good as impossible.\nCode:\n``````\n`  `     ,.`   `.   ``\n`     `   `.,,`,,'+';  ``,```  `\n`            ,'++''';++''''':'''';+;,:,,..     `     `.\n`   .+;+'++++:;''';::;'''+;:;''',''. `.`  `.`       `\n. ,,:+'';:;;:;+';;';;;;'::;;;+:;;:++;.'':,`,:.``.,`\n`              ..`;.+'';:'++''';;;;'''';;:;;;:,;;;',;'';+;;;';::,.``.`.  `` `      `\n.  .:.++';+''#++++''+'+;;+''+';;;;;:::;;;;:;';';';;;;'+::,::````` `\n`    `  ,`,.++''''++++#++''++++'++''''';''';;:::;:::;;;,;;;:'';;;';,::;;.`  .`     `\n,`,:.+;;+'++'+'+''++'''';;;;;'';+:;:;;'';;;;;::::,,:;:;;:;'';;,;;;,;;..,,:..``\n,;:''+##'++;'+'';';;''';';;;;;;;'::::;:;:;;''':;'::,;,,;,:::;;:,;,::;;;:';

If we take cryptograffiti[1] as a reference 2,000 bytes cost 0.00144600 BTC according to their preview. A ASCII picture like this costs ~0.03[2,3]. The limit on the costs is for one the fees needed for a TX and the max blocksize, but also that you need to burn bitcoin to an output that you will not be able to spend at a later date as its representing your data.

And at any given moment, about $1.7 trillion is out on loan.\nHedge funds, mutual funds, and other traders dont just buy and sell stock. They borrow it. Sometimes, theyre looking to short sell: If they borrow shares, sell them, and the price goes down, they reap a profit. Other times, they borrow as a way of hedging their stock positions or settling other deals. In the US alone, according to research from DataLend, about $954 billion in securities is typically on loan to some fund or another.\nMany players benefit from this little-discussed market. Sure, the borrowers can make some extra money. But the same goes for those who lend the securities out, including retirement funds and other large stock holders. They charge a fee for that loaned stock. And, yes, middlemen take a cut too, including prime brokers such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and dedicated lending houses, or agent lenders, like BNY Melon and State Street. The agent lenders alone make about $19.2 million a day helping organizations lend out their stock, and the prime brokers likely make even more.\nIts an enormously lucrative market. And its a market controlled by a relatively small group of players, most notably the prime brokers. Securities lending has historically been a closed network, says Josh Galper, who runs a financial consulting firm, Finadium, that closely tracks stock loans. In order to lend or borrow securities, you need to be one of the players in this market.\nPatrick Byrne, the iconoclastic CEO of e-commerce site Overstock.com and an unwavering voice for reform on Wall Street, wants to bust this market open. Using technology based on the blockchainthe technology that underpins the bitcoin digital currencyhe wants to move the stock-loan market onto the Internet and put it in the hands of, well, everyone. He wants to break the hold of the agent lenders and prime brokers, arguing that, as it stands, they make untold amounts of money from the loan market without giving stock holders their proper share. Were taking a market thats in the dark, Byrne says, and were putting it on an exchange.\nThe Dark Arts\nOn Tuesday evening, at a cocktail party held inside the Nasdaq stock exchange, Byrne unveiled his bitcoin-inspired stock-loan system under the aegis of an Overstock subsidiary called TØ.com. TØ.com has also used the blockchain to create an online system that can replace the primary stock markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. On Tuesday, Byrne unveiled this system too, saying it was on the verge of receiving approval from the SEC. But the world knew that was coming. The stock loan system was an unexpected reveal. The irrepressible Byrne wants to reform the financial markets in more ways than one.\nIn both cases, Byrne and TØ aim to remove the dark arts out of the financial markets, to put them online in a way that all transactions can be carefully verified, to ensure we always know who holds a given share, to limit the role of Wall Street middle men. The blockchain is essentially a massive online ledger, driven by a vast network of independent machines. With bitcoin, this ledger puts the money system in the hands of the people, limiting the role of big government and big banks. Now, Byrne wants to do the same for the financial markets.\nSome question whether Byrne is in a position to change these marketsno matter how powerful his technology. But separate from his efforts, Wall Street is waking up the notion that the blockchain can streamline our financial markets. This spring, Nasdaq itself announced that it will use the blockchain to drive a private stock market, and two other outfits, Digital Asset Holdings and Symbiont, are developing their own blockchain-based systems for the securities trading.\nPre-Borrow Assurance Tokens\nBut Byrnes stock loan system is unique. Based on blockchain-like technology from a startup called Peer Nova, it will allow pension funds and other stock holders to lend shares directly to hedge funds and other traders, essentially removing middlemen such as agent lenders and prime brokers from the process.\nThe setup is relatively simple. Stock holders will attach bitcoin-like digital tokens to each share of stock. Hedge funds and other traders will bid for the right to borrow shares. And then, thanks to the tokens, known as Pre-Borrow Assurance Tokens, or PATs, stock holders can closely track each transaction involving their loaned stock.\nThe system is an outgrowth of Byrnes well-documented experiences on Wall Street. A decade ago, Overstock was the victim of whats called naked short selling, where traders exploit a loophole in the system to short sell stock without actually borrowing ita practice that can drive down a stocks value. After the financial crash of 2008, the SEC moved to close this loophole. But with his blockchain-based systems, Byrne wants to ensure this kind of thing is eradicated entirelyin addition to streamlining the stock loan system as a whole.\nRisk Versus Reward\nGalper calls the system interesting, though he questions whether the existing players will end up using it. As with any closed system, the greatest beneficiaries of that system are the biggest participants, he says. Would the largest borrowers and lenders be keen to move to a new system and to provide more equal access to borrowers and lenders? I dont believe so.\nWhats more, he explains, lenders are happy with the existing system because the agent lenders (typically large banks) provide whats called counter-party default indemnification. This amounts to insurance for the shares sent out on loan. With TØs system, lenders must have a similar assurance that when they loan their stock, theyll get it back.\nThis is a question of risk versus reward, Galper says. If youre willing to take additional risk by lending directly to a hedge fund, then youre going to get greater reward. On the other hand, it is your responsibility to monitor that hedge fund, to insure that it is a good credit risk, that it pays on time, and that you get your stock back at the end of the transaction.\nAccording to Byrne, TØ.com does have ways of limiting counterparty risk. Initially, he says, lenders can use these system while keeping their shares with a large prime broker, such as Goldman Sachs, who can continue to provide default indemnification as always. So, the prime brokers will remain part of the process, but they may not benefit nearly as much as they did in the past.\nThe New Middleman\nOn the other side of the equation, Galper believes, smaller hedge funds may be keen to use TØs system. After all, it will allow them to borrow shares at a cheaper rate. The smaller a hedge fund you are, the more incentive you have to look for alternatives. If you have an opportunity to eliminate your middleman, then you can lower your price for borrowing.\nYes, Byrne and TØ.com are now Wall Street middlemen. But Byrne insists that they will charge lower rates than the incumbents, because their technology takes so much fat out of the market. And the larger point, he says, is this new system can give the market the transparency is has never had.\nEven if the system fails to replace the existing players, he says, it can push Wall Street in the same direction. On Tuesday evening, his primary message was that hes willing to share this technology with others. Weve shown the world what we have, he says, and now Im willing to listen to anyone who wants to talk.\n", "views": 209, "author": "unusualfacts30 Hero Member Offline Activity: 980 Merit: 500 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOverstock CEO Uses Bitcoin Tech to Spill Wall Street Secret\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-08-06 08:16:37"}, {"content": "Highlights\n:\n~250k Chinese crypto players\n5000+ QQ groups\nTop 3 cities: Beijing, Guangzhou,Shenzhen\nDerivative/Futures markets are expanding.\nTop 3 altcoins: BTS/DOGE/YBC\n30% of all players had mining experience\n8k qq members remain active on a daily basis.\n30k active traders\n10% renewal of the whole community\nSome players have returned to the crypto market after 6 month absence.\nFull report:\nhttp://www.8btc.com/community-report\n(in Chinese)\n", "views": 1500, "author": "hl5460 Legendary Offline Activity: 1622 Merit: 1000 news.8btc.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8btc: Chinese Bitcoin Community Report \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-03-03 07:24:14", "content": "2014 Bitcoin Hardware Review\n1.

Indeed, bitcoin relies on a P2P network of computers to proceed money transfers. Each part of the network works to create new bitcoins (mining), keep the network alive and validate transactions.\nAll the transactions are registered in the blockchain that is used to validate a transaction using cryptography technology: it ensures that you cant use a bitcoin you dont own or you dont use the same bitcoin more than once. This last action previously required a third party, but with bitcoin this is not the case anymore: the network replaces financial institutions and banks.\nThen, money transfers are almost in real time as the network is responsible for validating transactions. Currently you need only 10 minutes to get your money transfer approved.\nAs there is no third party the transfer is almost free. Miners are the only ones to be rewarded to issue new bitcoins. They also collect fees to integrate a new transaction into the blockchain, then validate a transfer. Currently a typical fee costs 0.0001 bitcoin (BTC) per transaction.\nThe remittance market is huge and moving swiftly to digital\nRemittance was a $582 billion market in 2014 according to the World Bank. Most of all it is dominated by transfers from developed countries to developing ones. In 2014, China received $64 billion through remittance and India $71 billion. Philippines received $25 billion, Mexico $22 billion, Nigeria $21 billion, Egypt $17 billion and Vietnam $11 billion in 2013.\nSo far most transactions are made through brick and mortar networks; in 2014 only 5% were digital transactions. These networks like Western Union or MoneyGram charge high fees to finance their deep local presence worldwide. A typical money transfer costs up to 10% fees.\nBut as mobile phones are spreading across the world, even in emerging countries, money transfers are shifting to digital. And mobile/digital remittance services are booming as they offer reduced fees mainly thanks to lower-fixed costs (maintaining a mobile app is much cheaper than operating a retail network).\nMost of the digital remittance operators claim they are at least 45% cheaper than physical networks. Some of these new companies are operating under a P2P model: connecting buyers and sellers to arrange currency exchanges.\nBitcoin allows several operating models\nEven through digital, remittance remains deeply dependent on third parties: banks are still validating money transfers from senders to the remittance operator and again to recipients.\nThen Bitcoin could even lower fees thanks to its decentralized network and through three different operating models that could be shaped:\nFull bitcoin: The sender owns bitcoins he sends to the recipient who can directly use them. This requires the owner to get bitcoin, which is easy in developed countries thanks to e-wallets and exchange platforms like Coinbase in the U.S. But it also requires the recipient either to be able to exchange them in fiat currency or to use bitcoins to pay for goods or services which is not that easy so far.\nFrom bitcoin to fiat currency: The sender have an easy access to bitcoins he sends to the remittance operator that sends fiat to the recipient. This model considers developing countries have an easy access to bitcoins wallets but paying with bitcoins is very limited especially in developing countries.\nFrom fiat currency to fiat currency: The sender pays its local money to the remittance operator that sends fiat to the recipient, using bitcoins to transfer money from one currency to another.\nA few startups are already operating on the bitcoin/remittance market\nEven at the early beginning this market has already attracted entrepreneurs and investors.\nThough far from Transferwise, a mobile remittance company that has a valuation over $1 billion and uses a P2P model to facilitate easy money transfers and currency exchanges, BitPesa has recently raised $1.1 million to ease bitcoins transfer from the UK to Africa.\nAbra raised a seed round and launched its service a few weeks ago in San-Francisco to ease money transfers based both on P2P and bitcoin technologies.\nIn emerging countries, Rebit is developing its remittance service to send money to the Philippines through bitcoin, ArtaBit develops a service to Indonesia and Coincove to Latin America.\nRisks and threats\nWhereas bitcoin is an open-source technology, it has long been regulated and constrained by banks and states. Because it relies on a P2P network to operate, bitcoin is seen as a threat to financial markets and states. Based on a combination of public and private key the technology is seen as an anonymous way to transfer money then easing traffic and money whitening. Then, for instance China forbids Chineses financial institutions from handling bitcoin transactions.\nCompanies that are operating bitcoin transfers also need to get a regulation approval to operate in developed markets as financial institutions request every actor to confirm it operates under transparent processes.\nThe bitcoin currency has also been very volatile, as its value moved from a few dollars for 1BTC at inception to over $1,000 for 1BTC at the end of 2013 and is now around $230 for 1BTC. This is a threat for bitcoin/remittance operators as they need to be very quick at exchanging currencies to make sure they will not keep bitcoins for a too long time. Protecting against currency exchange rates is the main issue for these companies.\nSecurity is another issue for the Bitcoin industry as a few platforms have been hacked and bitcoin wallets have been closed making millions of BTC disappear without any counterpart for their owners. Then bitcoin/remittance companies need to ensure customers they will not lose the money they upload on their platforms.\nFinally, bitcoin technology has a lot of property to attract digital remittance operators, starting with its decentralized technology, and some money has been invested in this market as the remittance industry is quickly shifting to digital. Bitcoin also seems to have been introduced to manage remittance to developing countries thanks to it low-cost operating structure, especially as a lot of money is currently lost in fees along the remittance process.\nFEATURED IMAGE: MIKE LEWINSKI/FLICKR UNDER A CC BY 2.0 LICENSE\nread on here :\nhttp://techcrunch.com/2015/05/25/bitcoin-might-be-the-next-big-thing-in-the-remittance-market/\n", "author": "ummina Member Offline Activity: 70 Merit: 10 ★777Coin.com★ Fun BTC Casino!

The company was told by the partner that attendees would possibly include Londons Metropolitan Police, the governments Home Office, domestic intelligence agency MI5, customs officials, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, and others.\nAfter this meeting, in September 2013, the London police force told Hacking Team that it was now ready to progress with a trial of the spying tool. In December the same year it then invited Hacking Team to formally submit a bid for a spy technology contract. A confidential document outlined that the force wanted to obtain Software that can be covertly introduced to a third parties device and will allow us to Look, Listen and Follow the third party. The Authority will receive, record and playback the Product retrieved from the third party on a System that shall be scalable, using proven technology that has in-built security measures appropriate to this task.\nBut the deal with the London cops, worth £385,000 ($591,000) to Hacking Team, was abruptly halted in in May 2014 following internal reviews on how we wished to move this area of technology forward, according to an email from the police, although the force left the door open for a future deal, adding: Of course in the months/years to come this could change and if that is the case then we would welcome your organizations participation.\nSince then, Hacking Team has continued to try to crack the U.K. market. It tried  and apparently failed  to set up a deal with Staffordshire Police after an officer contacted the company seeking technology to access WiFi points to check users and to infect devices to covertly collect data.\nHacking Team discussed whether it could sell its technology disguised under a different name, hiding its full functionality.\nAnd in January this year it began negotiating a contract with the British National Crime Agency. The meeting was a success, with an officer for the agency telling Hacking Team that a demonstration of the covert surveillance technology was extremely well received and proved to be a real eye opener for what can be achieved.\nIn April, the same officer told Hacking Team he wanted a quote for basic spyware that would log keystrokes, noting that he could then grow the system accordingly as we would then have the base platform. Hacking Team was interested in this proposal and discussed internally whether it could sell its technology disguised under a different name, hiding its full functionality. The deal appears to have since stalled, with the British agency telling Hacking Team in late May it was unable to arrange a meeting.\nThis doesn't mean, that the UK doesn't use illegal surveillance software btw. They only didn't want to buy the one from Hacking Team at this time.\n", "author": "AGD Legendary Offline Activity: 1680 Merit: 1025 HODLER SINCE 2013 "}, {"date": "2015-07-10 16:44:10", "content": "Just the tip of the iceberg in fact.\n-\nhttps://surveillance.rsf.org/en/\n\" On 12 March 2013, Reporters Without Borders published a Special report on Internet Surveillance... a list of \"Corporate Enemies of the Internet\", companies that sell products that are liable to be used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information. \"\n\" The five\n\"Corporate Enemies of the Internet\"\nnamed in March 2013 are:\nAmesys\n(France),\nBlue Coat Systems\n(U.S.),\nGamma\n(UK and Germany),\nHacking Team\n(Italy), and\nTrovicor\n(Germany). \"\n-snip-\nExactly.

Of course if you're the only person with access to the wallet and have not planned anything then yes, your bitcoins will be \"lost in the network.\"\n", "author": "thebenjamincode Hero Member Offline Activity: 490 Merit: 500 37iGtdUJc2xXTDkw5TQZJQX1Wb98gSLYVP "}, {"date": "2015-08-06 05:34:42", "content": "since there is nobody else who control your bitcoin (like a bank) so we should think ahead about any sort of incidence that might happen. for example writing private keys on a piece of paper and keeping it in a safe.\n", "author": "Pursuer Legendary Offline Activity: 1260 Merit: 1074 Where is my ring of blades...

If we take cryptograffiti[1] as a reference 2,000 bytes cost 0.00144600 BTC according to their preview. A ASCII picture like this costs ~0.03[2,3]. The limit on the costs is for one the fees needed for a TX and the max blocksize, but also that you need to burn bitcoin to an output that you will not be able to spend at a later date as its representing your data.

There would be plenty of other inputs of equal and shorter length than your encyclopedia, that theoretically would be a match. It would mean crypto is broken, but it would be by no means a reversible compression algorithm.\nAdditionally, it should be noted that a hash is also key to proving that a piece of data existed. If I need to prove that I came up with a certain invention today, I'd write up an unambiguous description (including a possible random nonce at the end, and/or my name), hash it, and record the exact description that I hashed. I then push the hash to the blockchain (which implicitly timestamps it by way of including it in a block).

And at any given moment, about $1.7 trillion is out on loan.\nHedge funds, mutual funds, and other traders dont just buy and sell stock. They borrow it. Sometimes, theyre looking to short sell: If they borrow shares, sell them, and the price goes down, they reap a profit. Other times, they borrow as a way of hedging their stock positions or settling other deals. In the US alone, according to research from DataLend, about $954 billion in securities is typically on loan to some fund or another.\nMany players benefit from this little-discussed market. Sure, the borrowers can make some extra money. But the same goes for those who lend the securities out, including retirement funds and other large stock holders. They charge a fee for that loaned stock. And, yes, middlemen take a cut too, including prime brokers such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and dedicated lending houses, or agent lenders, like BNY Melon and State Street. The agent lenders alone make about $19.2 million a day helping organizations lend out their stock, and the prime brokers likely make even more.\nIts an enormously lucrative market. And its a market controlled by a relatively small group of players, most notably the prime brokers. Securities lending has historically been a closed network, says Josh Galper, who runs a financial consulting firm, Finadium, that closely tracks stock loans. In order to lend or borrow securities, you need to be one of the players in this market.\nPatrick Byrne, the iconoclastic CEO of e-commerce site Overstock.com and an unwavering voice for reform on Wall Street, wants to bust this market open. Using technology based on the blockchainthe technology that underpins the bitcoin digital currencyhe wants to move the stock-loan market onto the Internet and put it in the hands of, well, everyone. He wants to break the hold of the agent lenders and prime brokers, arguing that, as it stands, they make untold amounts of money from the loan market without giving stock holders their proper share. Were taking a market thats in the dark, Byrne says, and were putting it on an exchange.\nThe Dark Arts\nOn Tuesday evening, at a cocktail party held inside the Nasdaq stock exchange, Byrne unveiled his bitcoin-inspired stock-loan system under the aegis of an Overstock subsidiary called TØ.com. TØ.com has also used the blockchain to create an online system that can replace the primary stock markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. On Tuesday, Byrne unveiled this system too, saying it was on the verge of receiving approval from the SEC. But the world knew that was coming. The stock loan system was an unexpected reveal. The irrepressible Byrne wants to reform the financial markets in more ways than one.\nIn both cases, Byrne and TØ aim to remove the dark arts out of the financial markets, to put them online in a way that all transactions can be carefully verified, to ensure we always know who holds a given share, to limit the role of Wall Street middle men. The blockchain is essentially a massive online ledger, driven by a vast network of independent machines. With bitcoin, this ledger puts the money system in the hands of the people, limiting the role of big government and big banks. Now, Byrne wants to do the same for the financial markets.\nSome question whether Byrne is in a position to change these marketsno matter how powerful his technology. But separate from his efforts, Wall Street is waking up the notion that the blockchain can streamline our financial markets. This spring, Nasdaq itself announced that it will use the blockchain to drive a private stock market, and two other outfits, Digital Asset Holdings and Symbiont, are developing their own blockchain-based systems for the securities trading.\nPre-Borrow Assurance Tokens\nBut Byrnes stock loan system is unique. Based on blockchain-like technology from a startup called Peer Nova, it will allow pension funds and other stock holders to lend shares directly to hedge funds and other traders, essentially removing middlemen such as agent lenders and prime brokers from the process.\nThe setup is relatively simple. Stock holders will attach bitcoin-like digital tokens to each share of stock. Hedge funds and other traders will bid for the right to borrow shares. And then, thanks to the tokens, known as Pre-Borrow Assurance Tokens, or PATs, stock holders can closely track each transaction involving their loaned stock.\nThe system is an outgrowth of Byrnes well-documented experiences on Wall Street. A decade ago, Overstock was the victim of whats called naked short selling, where traders exploit a loophole in the system to short sell stock without actually borrowing ita practice that can drive down a stocks value. After the financial crash of 2008, the SEC moved to close this loophole. But with his blockchain-based systems, Byrne wants to ensure this kind of thing is eradicated entirelyin addition to streamlining the stock loan system as a whole.\nRisk Versus Reward\nGalper calls the system interesting, though he questions whether the existing players will end up using it. As with any closed system, the greatest beneficiaries of that system are the biggest participants, he says. Would the largest borrowers and lenders be keen to move to a new system and to provide more equal access to borrowers and lenders? I dont believe so.\nWhats more, he explains, lenders are happy with the existing system because the agent lenders (typically large banks) provide whats called counter-party default indemnification. This amounts to insurance for the shares sent out on loan. With TØs system, lenders must have a similar assurance that when they loan their stock, theyll get it back.\nThis is a question of risk versus reward, Galper says. If youre willing to take additional risk by lending directly to a hedge fund, then youre going to get greater reward. On the other hand, it is your responsibility to monitor that hedge fund, to insure that it is a good credit risk, that it pays on time, and that you get your stock back at the end of the transaction.\nAccording to Byrne, TØ.com does have ways of limiting counterparty risk. Initially, he says, lenders can use these system while keeping their shares with a large prime broker, such as Goldman Sachs, who can continue to provide default indemnification as always. So, the prime brokers will remain part of the process, but they may not benefit nearly as much as they did in the past.\nThe New Middleman\nOn the other side of the equation, Galper believes, smaller hedge funds may be keen to use TØs system. After all, it will allow them to borrow shares at a cheaper rate. The smaller a hedge fund you are, the more incentive you have to look for alternatives. If you have an opportunity to eliminate your middleman, then you can lower your price for borrowing.\nYes, Byrne and TØ.com are now Wall Street middlemen. But Byrne insists that they will charge lower rates than the incumbents, because their technology takes so much fat out of the market. And the larger point, he says, is this new system can give the market the transparency is has never had.\nEven if the system fails to replace the existing players, he says, it can push Wall Street in the same direction. On Tuesday evening, his primary message was that hes willing to share this technology with others. Weve shown the world what we have, he says, and now Im willing to listen to anyone who wants to talk.\n", "views": 209, "author": "unusualfacts30 Hero Member Offline Activity: 980 Merit: 500 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOverstock CEO Uses Bitcoin Tech to Spill Wall Street Secret\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-08-06 08:16:37"}, {"content": "Highlights\n:\n~250k Chinese crypto players\n5000+ QQ groups\nTop 3 cities: Beijing, Guangzhou,Shenzhen\nDerivative/Futures markets are expanding.\nTop 3 altcoins: BTS/DOGE/YBC\n30% of all players had mining experience\n8k qq members remain active on a daily basis.\n30k active traders\n10% renewal of the whole community\nSome players have returned to the crypto market after 6 month absence.\nFull report:\nhttp://www.8btc.com/community-report\n(in Chinese)\n", "views": 1500, "author": "hl5460 Legendary Offline Activity: 1622 Merit: 1000 news.8btc.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8btc: Chinese Bitcoin Community Report \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-03-03 07:24:14", "content": "2014 Bitcoin Hardware Review\n1.
