However, sending bitcoins is like withdrawing cash from the bank; the coins that are sent out and debited from an account are almost always not the same coins that were deposited into that account...'\n'..Each account is associated with zero or more receiving addresses, and every receiving address is associated with exactly one account. Coins sent to a receiving address in the wallet are credited to the associated account..'\n'..The sendfrom method sends coins and debits the specified account. It does **not** change Bitcoin's algorithm for selecting which coins in the wallet are sent-- you should think of the coins in the wallet as being mixed together when they are received..'\nAnd finally..\n'..'sendtoaddress' always succeeds if there are sufficient funds in the\nserver's wallet.  For example, if your wallet account balances were 100 BTC in account\n'foo' and 0 BTC in the default account, then the balances after sendtoaddress\n1PC9aZC4hNX2rmmrt7uHTfYAS3hRbph4UN 10.00 would be 100 in account 'foo' and -10.00 in\nthe default account (and the overall server balance would go from 100 to 90 BTC).  On\nthe other hand, using 'sendfrom' to send from the default account with a zero balance\nwill fail with message \"Account has insufficient funds\"...'\nEven though an account balance can be negative the overall balance of a complete wallet, cannot be negative.\nThere really isn't a concept of 'accounts' and 'addresses' at the heart of bitcoin.

However, sending bitcoins is like withdrawing cash from the bank; the coins that are sent out and debited from an account are almost always not the same coins that were deposited into that account...'\n'..Each account is associated with zero or more receiving addresses, and every receiving address is associated with exactly one account. Coins sent to a receiving address in the wallet are credited to the associated account..'\n'..The sendfrom method sends coins and debits the specified account. It does **not** change Bitcoin's algorithm for selecting which coins in the wallet are sent-- you should think of the coins in the wallet as being mixed together when they are received..'\nAnd finally..\n'..'sendtoaddress' always succeeds if there are sufficient funds in the\nserver's wallet.  For example, if your wallet account balances were 100 BTC in account\n'foo' and 0 BTC in the default account, then the balances after sendtoaddress\n1PC9aZC4hNX2rmmrt7uHTfYAS3hRbph4UN 10.00 would be 100 in account 'foo' and -10.00 in\nthe default account (and the overall server balance would go from 100 to 90 BTC).  On\nthe other hand, using 'sendfrom' to send from the default account with a zero balance\nwill fail with message \"Account has insufficient funds\"...'\nEven though an account balance can be negative the overall balance of a complete wallet, cannot be negative.\nThere really isn't a concept of 'accounts' and 'addresses' at the heart of bitcoin. It's all about TXN outputs and scripts, that can be 'spent' (split into other outputs with scripts) by providing a valid script input.
