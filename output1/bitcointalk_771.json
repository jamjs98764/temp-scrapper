This will cause participants to go \"back\" to the \"real\" bitcoin which will cause the other market to continue to decline in value until it goes to (near) zero\nThis is one scenario. I have already detailed another scenario, and there are more hypothetical scenarios we could discuss as well with different expected outcomes. The point is in none of these scenarios the value will be\nworthless\n. Additionally, while you are correct that the network participant size is a crucial factor into determining the value of a currency it isn't the only factor. Bitcoin could have properties , even without a large userbase, that make it very valuable to internal and external users.\nI.E... If it became the de-facto dark market coin and maintained that lead because initial branding\nor if some group of vendors had products or services for they only accepted in Bitcoin currency.\nthen the newly forked code\nwill be worthless\nas will the coins that any miner mines using the unaccepted code.\nThe flaw in this statement lies in the fact that as long as someone values a token that attributes value to that data and thus it is no longer worthless. All alts, even failed ones have values above nothing as long as 1 user assigns such value. Before bitcoin was being traded for fiat, goods, or services it still had value as people wasted time, electricity, and hard drive space to maintain that data. Value doesn't come into existence by decree of some regulator or the fact that it needs to be traded with fiat currencies.\nI think the whole argument some claim that bitcoin will either go to nothing or be worth a lot is silly. If you lose faith in Bitcoin as originally principled by Satoshi there will be plenty of ideologues that buy your coins for cheap even for sentimental reasons , but more likely to be used on the black and grey markets.  Confederate currency is still worth money and it isn't being accepted anywhere for payment -\nhttp://www.ebay.com/sch/Confederate-Currency-/3414/i.html\n", "author": "inBitweTrust Hero Member Offline Activity: 658 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-10-23 03:22:34", "content": "Its accelerated out of the garage and the homes, to the small businesses, to the large data centers, and now youve got to have a mega data center for it to be profitable.\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-21/bitcoin-miner-ditches-clients-to-chase-2-billion-coding-prize.html\nKNC bitcoin central issuing authority.. great job guys creating the same shit sytem we already have.\nKNC bitcoin central issuing authority ?

Centralization of mining isn't unexpected:\nThe current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.\nMany people are confused to the risks of this consolidation and exaggerate the concerns. Please do a little more research into the incentives structure which discourages attacking the network even if there are only 100 mining farms and what a 51% attack actually does and how quickly it would be identified and prevented if it ever did happen.\n", "author": "inBitweTrust Hero Member Offline Activity: 658 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-10-24 03:14:48", "content": "Cheap chinese miners will take much more market share, currently the discuss fish pool is already the No. 1 in hash power\nMiners with free electricity will ultimately win against large mining farms, large mining farms can only stand a while with newer chip design, but their cost is significantly higher when difficulty eventually rise and electricity becomes more than half of the cost of each coin\nBut the biggest worry is that large banks will eventually build huge mining farms through funding, they could loan out 1 billion (out of nothing) to build and run a cluster of large mining farms thus control more than 70% of the network hash power easily and destroy the credibility of bitcoin transaction. I think knc is on this route to become their puppet, since they think in terms of fiat money\nI don't think this would be a serious threat. First of all an attacker (the \"big bad banks\" in your case) would need to spend actual money in order to launch such an attack, money they would end up loosing in an attack, when they could earn more money by acting honestly.\nIf a bank were to lend out money they would need to put some amount of money aside to account for the possibility that the loan will not be repaid, and it would certainly not be repaid as any attacker would not make any money from such an attack\n", "author": "opossum Hero Member Offline Activity: 927 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-10-24 03:24:10", "content": "What happens to the btc community if their infrastructure fails in a few years?

I have already detailed another scenario, and there are more hypothetical scenarios we could discuss as well with different expected outcomes. The point is in none of these scenarios the value will be\nworthless\n. Additionally, while you are correct that the network participant size is a crucial factor into determining the value of a currency it isn't the only factor. Bitcoin could have properties , even without a large userbase, that make it very valuable to internal and external users.\nI.E... If it became the de-facto dark market coin and maintained that lead because initial branding\nor if some group of vendors had products or services for they only accepted in Bitcoin currency.\nthen the newly forked code\nwill be worthless\nas will the coins that any miner mines using the unaccepted code.\nThe flaw in this statement lies in the fact that as long as someone values a token that attributes value to that data and thus it is no longer worthless. All alts, even failed ones have values above nothing as long as 1 user assigns such value. Before bitcoin was being traded for fiat, goods, or services it still had value as people wasted time, electricity, and hard drive space to maintain that data. Value doesn't come into existence by decree of some regulator or the fact that it needs to be traded with fiat currencies.\nI think the whole argument some claim that bitcoin will either go to nothing or be worth a lot is silly. If you lose faith in Bitcoin as originally principled by Satoshi there will be plenty of ideologues that buy your coins for cheap even for sentimental reasons , but more likely to be used on the black and grey markets.  Confederate currency is still worth money and it isn't being accepted anywhere for payment -\nhttp://www.ebay.com/sch/Confederate-Currency-/3414/i.html\n", "author": "inBitweTrust Hero Member Offline Activity: 658 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-10-23 03:22:34", "content": "Its accelerated out of the garage and the homes, to the small businesses, to the large data centers, and now youve got to have a mega data center for it to be profitable.\nhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-21/bitcoin-miner-ditches-clients-to-chase-2-billion-coding-prize.html\nKNC bitcoin central issuing authority.. great job guys creating the same shit sytem we already have.\nKNC bitcoin central issuing authority ?

Bitcoin is an open source project where these issues have been discussed openly and honestly for years. Centralization of mining isn't unexpected:\nThe current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.\nMany people are confused to the risks of this consolidation and exaggerate the concerns.

Perhaps drop them an email if you use (or intend to use) Bandcamp to either buy or sell music.\nSurely would do,love to see them accepting bitcoin\n", "author": "Plank Member Offline Activity: 61 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-10-29 05:05:16", "content": "Just DIY\nhttps://jollyecosystem.bandcamp.com/album/soul-misplace-heart-race\n", "author": "letcore Newbie Offline Activity: 29 Merit: 0 "}], "date": "2011-05-17 23:05:54"}, {"content": "This topic has been moved to\nServices\n.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=838030.0\n", "views": 651, "author": "Cyrus Ninja Administrator Legendary Offline Activity: 2058 Merit: 1015 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMOVED: Anyone a job for me,to earn some btc?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2014-10-28 20:15:56"}, {"content": "This topic has been moved to\nServices\n.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=837714.0\n", "views": 641, "author": "Cyrus Ninja Administrator Legendary Offline Activity: 2058 Merit: 1015 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMOVED: I am promoting your cryptocoin,services ... \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2014-10-28 16:41:08"}, {"content": "HELLO FRIENDS, I've made ​​the android application to determine the movement of the price of Bitcoin and Altcoins other, my application can also provide comparative information between bittrex, poloniex, cryptsy or others. with my application you can do an analysis before sending your money to the exchangers.\nI have made this project for 2 months, and I share with all the members here for free. and to all who enjoy an application apologize if the user interface is less attractive in your heart, the most important thing is my application can provide more benefits to you all,\nyou can download my application in link :\nhttp://www.droidbin.com/p1953nslpf1b4jli3gq11mkt1st73\nso enjoy my application. thank you\nyou can also give me bitcoin tip in address : 1P6sJhAQp838LWWj8ToGs5dYSiXg8xLAJr\n", "views": 997, "author": "MrJasonXRay Newbie Offline Activity: 1 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndroid App for Cryptocurrency\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-10-26 14:52:54", "content": "I think you should try to upload it to google play\nI couldn't trust an app like that without passing some security filters\n", "author": "bitllionaire Legendary Offline Activity: 1106 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-10-26 15:01:55", "content": "Please make this app for windows phone as well...! i dont have Android!\n", "author": "philiveyjr Legendary Offline Activity: 840 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-10-26 15:45:39", "content": "Please make this app for windows phone as well...! i dont have Android!\nI'm also using a Windows phone, please support this OS too.\n", "author": "AddisonZebulon Newbie Offline Activity: 3 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2014-10-26 15:47:58", "content": "Registered today, posted app and never logged back in.
