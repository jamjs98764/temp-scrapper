There is not much that can be done about those scams either.\nBesides, we need the scammers to go to prison so that\nsome\nhesitate before trying to scam.\nDoesn't matter. Stop promoting the act of scamming.\nHe is for sure guilty of one thing. When MtGox was attacked first time staff and Karpeles know about this. Yes he did not share this information with customers and instead he cover it up.\nPeople are unaware of danger and still deposited BTC which were later stolen. For this alone he should go to jail.\n", "author": "Snorek Legendary Offline Activity: 1400 Merit: 1001 "}, {"date": "2015-08-02 17:39:27", "content": "Jackboot statist thugs.

In comparison, 100bit.co.in has given a great service against INR and I, myself, has experienced it. Moreover, bitquick.co or its subsidiaries are not global like LocalBitcoins/100bit.co.in. So, they are not directly comparable either.\nTrue, I would only recommend the US version since I got screwed out of 180 euro when I used the SEPA option. My bank called me and claimed that the 180 euro I received was from an account that claimed their account was hacked. Unfortunately I had already sent my bitcoins so there was no way of getting them back. And being in a foreign country there's no way I could work within the system to get it back without a lot of hassle and unwanted meddling into my finances.\nThe US version, someone gets your bank account info, they go to the bank and deposit the money then take a picture of the deposit slip and upload it. Then you wait to see if the funds are in your account and you release the coins. No way to reverse a cash deposit. It's just as good as meeting in person (except the part about involving a bank).\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2015-06-25 11:17:06", "content": "Lately I see\nwww.100bit.co.in\nis being advertised as LocalBitcoins alternative on this forum.

So, the volume is low.\nI wish local bitcoins had a Alt coin option. Step up your game local bitcoins!\nLooks like a great new site, just waiting for volume on it to pick up steam.\nif everyone is just waiting for the volume to raise, then it will never raise, better to take advantage of its feature and join it now, if you need localbitcoin but for altcoin, it should be the best available service out there\nI wish local bitcoins had a Alt coin option.

Their site seems to be under maintenance right now.\nPersonally, I think the added utility of offering direct altcoin trading would be small. All altcoins are priced in terms of BTC anyway with the prices being dictated by altcoin exchanges where anyone one can trade their bitcoins for altcoins and vice versa. I know 100bit.co.in prices their altcoins in terms of BTC but pricing altcoins in terms of fiat in the same way others like Litecoinlocal.net and Localdogecoin.com do also introduces an extra conversion step into the calculations that makes it harder to tell if you're getting a good price.\nAlso, a huge reason why LocalBitcoins is so popular is because the traditional exchanges tend to have more restrictive verification procedures and many people don't want to go through the hassle of setting up an account just make the occasional trade. To trade at Bitstamp or BTC-e for example, requires you to submit proof of ID and proof of residence, wait 3-5 days for bank wire transfers to clear, pay withdrawal or bank fees, etc. Altcoin exchanges, on the other hand, usually admit anyone who has BTC to trade.\nLooks like a great new site, just waiting for volume on it to pick up steam.\nWhile I agree it is a good new site with decent features, it has been around for quite some time so far without picking up steam, maybe they need to start and keep up a decent marketing campaign to get fully noticed, because once people notice it that will be used more without a doubt.\nThey have a signature campaign\nhere\nalthough it only has 5 spots.\n", "author": "Lorenzo Sr. Member Offline Activity: 406 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-06-26 05:52:48", "content": "I'm looking forward to the launch of Coinffeine, as that will be a true LocalBitcoins alternative\n", "author": "jdebunt Legendary Offline Activity: 1428 Merit: 1000 Freelance Bitcoin / Blockchain / FinTech Writer "}, {"date": "2015-06-26 11:26:10", "content": "I'm looking forward to the launch of Coinffeine, as that will be a true LocalBitcoins alternative\nNeither OpenBazaar will be an alternative to eBay, nor Coinffeine or BitSquare will be an alternative to LocalBitcoins.

Localbitcoins instead opted to block the website from\nGerman IP addresses\n(hint hint).\nBitpools is not working for me now, I'll try again later.\nI was referring to this link:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=943143.0\nI hope you don't mind if I send you some messages in the next days, it will be awesome to be in touch with you.

So VPNs and tor and other connections to localbitcoins can find the ads. Though it created the affect of locking everyone in since you can't add or edit ads in Germany.

In another area I only have one competitor who just happened to be 1% lower than me before the lockdown, so he gets most of the business in that area. Now that I have the debit card I had considered stopping localbitcoins sales because I want to get rid of my banks but getting 10% on sales brings in some decent spending money every month so it's hard to justify it.

The SEC stopped Edward Jones from getting kickbacks on money invested with The Hartford among others and required Edward Jones to make restitution to those ripped off which included my mother.  I insisted we move my mother's financial holdings out of Edward Jones to any other broker.

My bank called me and claimed that the 180 euro I received was from an account that claimed their account was hacked. Unfortunately I had already sent my bitcoins so there was no way of getting them back. And being in a foreign country there's no way I could work within the system to get it back without a lot of hassle and unwanted meddling into my finances.\nThe US version, someone gets your bank account info, they go to the bank and deposit the money then take a picture of the deposit slip and upload it. Then you wait to see if the funds are in your account and you release the coins. No way to reverse a cash deposit. It's just as good as meeting in person (except the part about involving a bank).\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2015-06-25 11:17:06", "content": "Lately I see\nwww.100bit.co.in\nis being advertised as LocalBitcoins alternative on this forum.

So, the volume is low.\nI wish local bitcoins had a Alt coin option. Step up your game local bitcoins!\nLooks like a great new site, just waiting for volume on it to pick up steam.\nif everyone is just waiting for the volume to raise, then it will never raise, better to take advantage of its feature and join it now, if you need localbitcoin but for altcoin, it should be the best available service out there\nI wish local bitcoins had a Alt coin option.

Their site seems to be under maintenance right now.\nPersonally, I think the added utility of offering direct altcoin trading would be small. All altcoins are priced in terms of BTC anyway with the prices being dictated by altcoin exchanges where anyone one can trade their bitcoins for altcoins and vice versa. I know 100bit.co.in prices their altcoins in terms of BTC but pricing altcoins in terms of fiat in the same way others like Litecoinlocal.net and Localdogecoin.com do also introduces an extra conversion step into the calculations that makes it harder to tell if you're getting a good price.\nAlso, a huge reason why LocalBitcoins is so popular is because the traditional exchanges tend to have more restrictive verification procedures and many people don't want to go through the hassle of setting up an account just make the occasional trade. To trade at Bitstamp or BTC-e for example, requires you to submit proof of ID and proof of residence, wait 3-5 days for bank wire transfers to clear, pay withdrawal or bank fees, etc. Altcoin exchanges, on the other hand, usually admit anyone who has BTC to trade.\nLooks like a great new site, just waiting for volume on it to pick up steam.\nWhile I agree it is a good new site with decent features, it has been around for quite some time so far without picking up steam, maybe they need to start and keep up a decent marketing campaign to get fully noticed, because once people notice it that will be used more without a doubt.\nThey have a signature campaign\nhere\nalthough it only has 5 spots.\n", "author": "Lorenzo Sr. Member Offline Activity: 406 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-06-26 05:52:48", "content": "I'm looking forward to the launch of Coinffeine, as that will be a true LocalBitcoins alternative\n", "author": "jdebunt Legendary Offline Activity: 1428 Merit: 1000 Freelance Bitcoin / Blockchain / FinTech Writer "}, {"date": "2015-06-26 11:26:10", "content": "I'm looking forward to the launch of Coinffeine, as that will be a true LocalBitcoins alternative\nNeither OpenBazaar will be an alternative to eBay, nor Coinffeine or BitSquare will be an alternative to LocalBitcoins.

As many of you, I regret don't start using them at that time, but I invested enough time reading and researching about cryptocurrencies, and for me now is the time to begin.\nI'm moving to Berlin in Germany to make a scientific research, leaving my stable job and I won't receive a salary, at least for the first months. Nevertheless, one of my goals is\nTO LIVE ONLY USING BITCOINS\nor cryptocurrencies in general. Of course this process will be gradually implemented, since I must plan and think about many different variables, and here is where I really need your expertise. Unfortunately, as far as I see on the web, there are very few commercial stores in Berlin which accept BitCoins, even if I focussed my atention just in some restaurants and bars, since for now I will need mainly food and some basic services.\nI have enough faith that cryptocurrencies can help us to improve this terrible global economic system, and for this reason I don't see Bitcoin as and investment, but as an legitimate exchange tool. I mean, my intention is not to accumulate BitCoins, but using them to receive payment for my services and to pay for my basic needs. This vision is inserted into a personal global project, about an alternative way of living and consuming, and we can talk about this if you want.\nThank you very much in advance for your comments, suggestions, critics, contacts and help.

So VPNs and tor and other connections to localbitcoins can find the ads. Though it created the affect of locking everyone in since you can't add or edit ads in Germany.
