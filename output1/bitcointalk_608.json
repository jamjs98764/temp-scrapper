The investigations, based on the same set of leaked documents, concluded that Wright either is Nakamoto, or else mastermind of a very clever hoax designed to lead people to believe he Nakamoto.\nBut a new analysis of Wright's writing by a company which has been tracking Nakamoto via his anonymous texts for years concludes that he is highly unlikely to be the bitcoin founder. Indeed, the search for Satoshi Nakamoto goes on.\nIn the wake of the investigations, International Business Times asked Juola &amp; Associates, a firm that uses a technique called stylometry to identify the authors of anonymous texts, to compare Wrights writing with texts known to be written by Nakamoto, such as the original bitcoin whitepaper published in 2009. Based on linguistic evidence, we do not believe that Craig Wright authored the bitcoin paper, John Noecker, chief scientist at Juola &amp; Associates said.\nNoecker came to the conclusion using a text analysis tool called Envelope, which condenses millions of different linguistic features that we have studied over the past 40 combined years of linguistic research into just a few best practices.\nText analysis is not a foolproof method of identifying someone but Joula, whose techniques were developed by professor Patrick Juola at Duquesne University, have proven effective in the past. It was Joula who first identified Harry Potter author JK Rowling as the writer behind \"The Cuckoos Calling,\" a book which she published under a pseudonym. To help identify Nakamoto, the company has over the years tweaked its algorithm specifically to help identify the bitcoin creator.\nWhile many believe that Wright was a hoaxer and most of the evidence against him was planted by Wright himself to trick the journalists at Wired and Gizmodo, there is still no conclusive proof that Wright is not Nakamoto. While a message on a bitcoin forum from an email address known to be associated with the bitcoin creator reading I am not Craig Wright. We are all Satoshi. was posted in the wake of the reports being published, it was not accompanied by a PGP key which would have proven its provinence.\nFull Story:\nhttp://www.ibtimes.com/craig-wright-not-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-according-new-text-analysis-2276141\n~~\n", "views": 406, "author": "MicroGuy Legendary Online Activity: 1904 Merit: 1003 www.MicroGuy.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBreaking: Craig Wright Is Not Satoshi Nakamoto According To New Text Analysis!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-01-22 17:36:11", "content": "it was pretty much settled that he is not satoshi because he lied about getting PhD and faked the PGP key. not to mention that lots of people wrote him off as a hoaxer right away.\n", "author": "Jhanzo Hero Member Offline Activity: 728 Merit: 503 "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 18:13:36", "content": "Clearly Peter Todd is a better Satoshi candidate (actually he is, what that means requires a slightly different analysis):\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/420bua/peter_todd_is_probably_satoshi/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/422sf8/part2_in_2001_peter_todd_and_hal_finney_were/\nEdit - I mean, my head is spinning here, could there be some truth to this . . .\n", "author": "Mr Felt Hero Member Offline Activity: 492 Merit: 518 "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 18:19:44", "content": "i knew that the first day craig hit the headlines.. as soon as media said he was australian. .. instant drop from the list of potentials\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Offline Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 19:18:41", "content": "", "author": "unamis76 Legendary Offline Activity: 1414 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 21:43:42", "content": "Linguistic analysis?

That means cryptocurrencies would be treated the same as U.S. dollars, Euros or any other currency when dealing with monetary transfers.\nThe bills main sponsor is Rep. Tyler Lindholm, R-Sundance. Lindholm said the best way to explain what the bill would do is to consider the current rules for transferring money using a company like Western Union.\nIf I was going to send you $100 via Western Union, the Wyoming Money Transmitter Act requires Western Union to have $100 in cash reserves, so they have a backup if they lose my money somewhere along the way, Lindholm said.\nBut what if you wanted to buy something using a service like PayPal, and you wanted to pay with bitcoin instead of dollars? Under the states current interpretation of the law, PayPal would need to have the corresponding amount of bitcoin in reserves, in addition to dollars.\nIn other words, if you wanted to buy $100 worth of product in bitcoin, the company making the transaction would need $200 in reserves to cover the transaction  half in bitcoin, half in dollars.\nWith bitcoins, theyve got to do double what anybody else does, Lindholm said. And for that reason, several institutions have refused to do business in the state of Wyoming.\nBitcoin is the most prominent cryptocurrency, but there actually are more than 650 such currencies available for trade in online markets. Lindholm describes them as a sort of hybrid between fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and precious metals like gold or platinum.\nLike fiat currencies, bitcoins and other digital currencies base their value on trust in the system instead of any specific backing commodity. But like precious metals, bitcoins are finite; there is an upper limit to the number of bitcoins that can ever be produced.\nBitcoins are created using a decentralized process called mining, where individuals process transactions and secure the decentralized bitcoin network using specialized computer hardware. In exchange for that service, they collect new bitcoins, or fractions of new bitcoins.\nIn terms of the mathematics behind it, its absolutely fascinating, said Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, one of HB26s co-sponsors. Its certainly not a system I would have 100 percent confidence in  I dont want all my money in bitcoin, thats for sure  but from a policy standpoint, for the state of Wyoming to treat it differently than any other currency holds it back.\nDespite wide swings in value, bitcoin has seen increased usage in online transactions. And for that reason, Rothfuss and the other co-sponsors of HB26 believe it and other cryptocurrencies deserve a fair shot in the Equality State.\nThe legislation were providing doesnt do an awful lot other than try to provide that level playing field, Rothfuss said. In my view, it needs to be treated the same as a ruble or a Euro, or any other currency.\nLindholm said HB26 makes good business sense, given that the current state law has already caused some bitcoin-friendly businesses to pull out of Wyoming.\n~~\nFull Story:\nhttp://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/house-bill-seeks-to-make-it-easier-to-deal-in/article_f16d3bec-b6a5-537f-8056-976aee5f333e.html\n~~\n", "views": 406, "author": "MicroGuy Legendary Online Activity: 1904 Merit: 1003 www.MicroGuy.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWyoming Legislators Seek to Make it Easier to Deal in Digital Currencies! :)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-01-22 04:25:50", "content": "I like were this article went all the way until the end although Lindholm showed the problem that most businesses face while using\nBTC\nitcoin here, but it wasn't completely a negative one as their attempting to consider\nBTC\nitcoin like any other fiat and actually try to ease it's use (hopefully) so looking forward for this bill to get accepted.\n", "author": "SFR10 Legendary Offline Activity: 1204 Merit: 1135 SFR DESIGNS - http://bit.ly/2ClWYOh "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 04:38:16", "content": "So the IRS has classified Bitcoin as a commodity and Wyoming is classifying it as a currency like USD?  This will be interested to watch how states attempt to work Bitcoin into legislation.\n", "author": "BellaBitBit Hero Member Offline Activity: 700 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 05:01:44", "content": "So the IRS has classified Bitcoin as a commodity and Wyoming is classifying it as a currency like USD?  This will be interested to watch how states attempt to work Bitcoin into legislation.\nits not an commodity or a fiat.. the reality is that it is an asset currency\nEG\ncommodity is a raw material that can be made into something else wheat=flour, corn=cereal gold=electronics, oil=car fuel.. bitcoin is not a raw material so fails the commodity test.\nFIAT in the most laymens description is\nF\nederally.\nI\nnsured.\nA\nnd.\nT\naxed (the most basic way to describe it but gets the point across quickly) so fails that test too.\nbut an asset currency explains bitcoins use very easily and accurately..

The investigations, based on the same set of leaked documents, concluded that Wright either is Nakamoto, or else mastermind of a very clever hoax designed to lead people to believe he Nakamoto.\nBut a new analysis of Wright's writing by a company which has been tracking Nakamoto via his anonymous texts for years concludes that he is highly unlikely to be the bitcoin founder. Indeed, the search for Satoshi Nakamoto goes on.\nIn the wake of the investigations, International Business Times asked Juola &amp; Associates, a firm that uses a technique called stylometry to identify the authors of anonymous texts, to compare Wrights writing with texts known to be written by Nakamoto, such as the original bitcoin whitepaper published in 2009. Based on linguistic evidence, we do not believe that Craig Wright authored the bitcoin paper, John Noecker, chief scientist at Juola &amp; Associates said.\nNoecker came to the conclusion using a text analysis tool called Envelope, which condenses millions of different linguistic features that we have studied over the past 40 combined years of linguistic research into just a few best practices.\nText analysis is not a foolproof method of identifying someone but Joula, whose techniques were developed by professor Patrick Juola at Duquesne University, have proven effective in the past. It was Joula who first identified Harry Potter author JK Rowling as the writer behind \"The Cuckoos Calling,\" a book which she published under a pseudonym. To help identify Nakamoto, the company has over the years tweaked its algorithm specifically to help identify the bitcoin creator.\nWhile many believe that Wright was a hoaxer and most of the evidence against him was planted by Wright himself to trick the journalists at Wired and Gizmodo, there is still no conclusive proof that Wright is not Nakamoto. While a message on a bitcoin forum from an email address known to be associated with the bitcoin creator reading I am not Craig Wright. We are all Satoshi. was posted in the wake of the reports being published, it was not accompanied by a PGP key which would have proven its provinence.\nFull Story:\nhttp://www.ibtimes.com/craig-wright-not-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-according-new-text-analysis-2276141\n~~\n", "views": 406, "author": "MicroGuy Legendary Online Activity: 1904 Merit: 1003 www.MicroGuy.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBreaking: Craig Wright Is Not Satoshi Nakamoto According To New Text Analysis!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-01-22 17:36:11", "content": "it was pretty much settled that he is not satoshi because he lied about getting PhD and faked the PGP key. not to mention that lots of people wrote him off as a hoaxer right away.\n", "author": "Jhanzo Hero Member Offline Activity: 728 Merit: 503 "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 18:13:36", "content": "Clearly Peter Todd is a better Satoshi candidate (actually he is, what that means requires a slightly different analysis):\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/420bua/peter_todd_is_probably_satoshi/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/422sf8/part2_in_2001_peter_todd_and_hal_finney_were/\nEdit - I mean, my head is spinning here, could there be some truth to this . . .\n", "author": "Mr Felt Hero Member Offline Activity: 492 Merit: 518 "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 18:19:44", "content": "i knew that the first day craig hit the headlines.. as soon as media said he was australian. .. instant drop from the list of potentials\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Offline Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 19:18:41", "content": "", "author": "unamis76 Legendary Offline Activity: 1414 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 21:43:42", "content": "Linguistic analysis?

That means cryptocurrencies would be treated the same as U.S. dollars, Euros or any other currency when dealing with monetary transfers.\nThe bills main sponsor is Rep. Tyler Lindholm, R-Sundance. Lindholm said the best way to explain what the bill would do is to consider the current rules for transferring money using a company like Western Union.\nIf I was going to send you $100 via Western Union, the Wyoming Money Transmitter Act requires Western Union to have $100 in cash reserves, so they have a backup if they lose my money somewhere along the way, Lindholm said.\nBut what if you wanted to buy something using a service like PayPal, and you wanted to pay with bitcoin instead of dollars? Under the states current interpretation of the law, PayPal would need to have the corresponding amount of bitcoin in reserves, in addition to dollars.\nIn other words, if you wanted to buy $100 worth of product in bitcoin, the company making the transaction would need $200 in reserves to cover the transaction  half in bitcoin, half in dollars.\nWith bitcoins, theyve got to do double what anybody else does, Lindholm said. And for that reason, several institutions have refused to do business in the state of Wyoming.\nBitcoin is the most prominent cryptocurrency, but there actually are more than 650 such currencies available for trade in online markets. Lindholm describes them as a sort of hybrid between fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and precious metals like gold or platinum.\nLike fiat currencies, bitcoins and other digital currencies base their value on trust in the system instead of any specific backing commodity. But like precious metals, bitcoins are finite; there is an upper limit to the number of bitcoins that can ever be produced.\nBitcoins are created using a decentralized process called mining, where individuals process transactions and secure the decentralized bitcoin network using specialized computer hardware. In exchange for that service, they collect new bitcoins, or fractions of new bitcoins.\nIn terms of the mathematics behind it, its absolutely fascinating, said Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, one of HB26s co-sponsors. Its certainly not a system I would have 100 percent confidence in  I dont want all my money in bitcoin, thats for sure  but from a policy standpoint, for the state of Wyoming to treat it differently than any other currency holds it back.\nDespite wide swings in value, bitcoin has seen increased usage in online transactions. And for that reason, Rothfuss and the other co-sponsors of HB26 believe it and other cryptocurrencies deserve a fair shot in the Equality State.\nThe legislation were providing doesnt do an awful lot other than try to provide that level playing field, Rothfuss said. In my view, it needs to be treated the same as a ruble or a Euro, or any other currency.\nLindholm said HB26 makes good business sense, given that the current state law has already caused some bitcoin-friendly businesses to pull out of Wyoming.\n~~\nFull Story:\nhttp://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/house-bill-seeks-to-make-it-easier-to-deal-in/article_f16d3bec-b6a5-537f-8056-976aee5f333e.html\n~~\n", "views": 406, "author": "MicroGuy Legendary Online Activity: 1904 Merit: 1003 www.MicroGuy.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWyoming Legislators Seek to Make it Easier to Deal in Digital Currencies! :)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2016-01-22 04:25:50", "content": "I like were this article went all the way until the end although Lindholm showed the problem that most businesses face while using\nBTC\nitcoin here, but it wasn't completely a negative one as their attempting to consider\nBTC\nitcoin like any other fiat and actually try to ease it's use (hopefully) so looking forward for this bill to get accepted.\n", "author": "SFR10 Legendary Offline Activity: 1204 Merit: 1135 SFR DESIGNS - http://bit.ly/2ClWYOh "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 04:38:16", "content": "So the IRS has classified Bitcoin as a commodity and Wyoming is classifying it as a currency like USD?  This will be interested to watch how states attempt to work Bitcoin into legislation.\n", "author": "BellaBitBit Hero Member Offline Activity: 700 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2016-01-22 05:01:44", "content": "So the IRS has classified Bitcoin as a commodity and Wyoming is classifying it as a currency like USD?  This will be interested to watch how states attempt to work Bitcoin into legislation.\nits not an commodity or a fiat.. the reality is that it is an asset currency\nEG\ncommodity is a raw material that can be made into something else wheat=flour, corn=cereal gold=electronics, oil=car fuel.. bitcoin is not a raw material so fails the commodity test.\nFIAT in the most laymens description is\nF\nederally.\nI\nnsured.\nA\nnd.\nT\naxed (the most basic way to describe it but gets the point across quickly) so fails that test too.\nbut an asset currency explains bitcoins use very easily and accurately..
