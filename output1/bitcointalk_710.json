Wanted to share this great 4-part series we put out this week on BitGive and the Bitcoin-funded water well just completed in Kenya! There were several threads and efforts on this forum that contributed to us and our work, so thank you and thank you to all the donors!\nWe also are producing a video about the water well, and have a short trailer released now. The longer video will be coming out later this year.  Video production is sponsored by BitPesa and LibraTax.\nOur Blog is a great place to access all four parts in the Bitcoin Magazine series and the video as well - all in one click!\nhttp://bitgivefoundation.org/2015/03/happy-world-water-day-share-in-our-kenya-experience/\nThanks for all the support!\nConnie M.
