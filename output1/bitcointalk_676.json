You have to pay a bit higher fees, yes, but it does in no way hinder regular transactions.\nYou point out correctly that increasing the maximum blocksize is a risky decision. If decentralization is hurt, the entire Bitcoin system is at stake. In my opinion, higher fees are the only solution to spam attacks. We need a healthy fee market. Bitcoin itself doesn't scale well enough to include all microtransactions.\nSolutions are already in the works. Sidechains will offer a faster, cheaper, and sufficiently reliable ways to transact in &lt;$1 values. Small-value transactions do not need the same level of security as higher value ones anyway.\nSo there will be solutions on top of Bitcoin that address the problem. However even with a very conservative approach to blocksize-increases, I don't think that it will ever be a problem to send &gt;$5 transactions without using such solutions for a reasonable fee.\n", "author": "IIOII Legendary Offline Activity: 1130 Merit: 1005 "}, {"date": "2015-07-08 13:27:11", "content": "Block size increase is obviously required.

Bitcoin offers extremely fast transactions and extremely low transactions fees - just not for cent-value transactions.\nThe maximum blocksize will have to increase a bit to make sidechains possible.

BTC was very cheap then, and miners had no money, compared to the huge amounts today invested in hardware for which they want ROI, investments large enough for them to want Bitcoin to succeed.\nFPGA mining was just being discussed in mid-2010.

No. And they won't after raising the limit a mere 800%, or even doubling that every two years.\nSatoshi knew the 1MB was a risk to his long-term vision for a global competitor to the likes of VISA, but he did massive code changes, and frequently.

The security issues - hacking, Mt Gox etc. People feel uncertain in their own capability to keep their bitcoins safe, and they are troubled more when they are told about the no recourse of bitcoins that are stolen...\nBut let's say that some people think they could handle the security issue.. and they are optimistic that in the future with higher adoption rate it will have higher utility... then the next issue seems to really be a troublesome issue..:\n3.

This bad press reflects poorly on cryptocoins in general and actually could hold back altcoins too.\nI don't really see altcoins actually holding back Bitcoin though.\nLogic seems to suggest altcoins all else equal will be holding bitcoins back. Many see bitcoin as an investment, or at the very least hope to not lose money when being in bitcoin over FIAT.\nNow, think of it as odds - what are the odds that their investment in bitcoin will be successful? Between Bitcoin and FIAT it might, for argument's sake) be 20%. So apparently some there is some 20% chance that a shared ledger is such a cool idea that it will succeed (however we want to measure this). So 80% that FIAT will somehow never allow Bitcoin to become anything worth talking about.\nBut if altcoins enter the scene, the odds change. Suddenly some percentages have to be given to these cruptocurrencies, and the investment in bitcoin obviously looks less good.\nSo - I can certainly understand if the man on the street would have an easier time swallowing bitcoin if there was not the added confusion and issue of all these other currencies.\n", "author": "ransomer Jr. Member Offline Activity: 56 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-07-02 03:24:26", "content": "While the two first issues are commonly discussed, I haven't really seen to many discuss how the other altcoins are holding bitcoins back.

Far easier and cheaper to just use fiat and or my debit/credit card.\nIf however I was offered an incentive like for example a discount on my purchases then bitcoin will be something to consider. If the conversion process in regards to cost and effort is effortless and cheap then it will definitely be something to take into consideration. At this stage however, this is not the case, so as said, there is no incentive for me to use it.\nMost people who currently hold bitcoin do so for several reason but I personally think a large number of them are in a similar situation as above.

Or unless certain cryptocurrencies were intentionally designed to fill specific roles like I described above, by following a standard of designation such as gold-standard, silver-standard and bronze-standard.\nFor example, a bronze-standard cryptocurrency would have confirmation times between 5-15 seconds, such that everyday use wouldn't take much longer than the equivalent Visa/Mastercard/etc processing times in checkouts.

As soon as this value is already average for the market and confirmed along with the block it may be well trusted.\nSecondly there are two side effects which I found very nice.

If we allow any peer offer its price it is going to be more democratic (and fun). If you are fat wallet holder fine bully the price. If you are bitcoin-poor lower it hoping to buy more.

Still cannot believe how a tiny pool (1% of total hashrate) could cause so much havoc for whole network.\nNote that the roughly 50% of the network that was SPV mining had explicitly indicated that they would enforce the BIP66 rules. By not doing so, several large miners have lost over $50,000 dollars worth of mining income so far.\nLearnt something new. I don't understand much about SPV mining until today. F2Pool and Antpool only lost 2 hours' worth of hashing, that is merely 8% of there daily income.

You have to pay a bit higher fees, yes, but it does in no way hinder regular transactions.\nYou point out correctly that increasing the maximum blocksize is a risky decision. If decentralization is hurt, the entire Bitcoin system is at stake. In my opinion, higher fees are the only solution to spam attacks. We need a healthy fee market. Bitcoin itself doesn't scale well enough to include all microtransactions.\nSolutions are already in the works. Sidechains will offer a faster, cheaper, and sufficiently reliable ways to transact in &lt;$1 values. Small-value transactions do not need the same level of security as higher value ones anyway.\nSo there will be solutions on top of Bitcoin that address the problem. However even with a very conservative approach to blocksize-increases, I don't think that it will ever be a problem to send &gt;$5 transactions without using such solutions for a reasonable fee.\n", "author": "IIOII Legendary Offline Activity: 1130 Merit: 1005 "}, {"date": "2015-07-08 13:27:11", "content": "Block size increase is obviously required.

This bad press reflects poorly on cryptocoins in general and actually could hold back altcoins too.\nI don't really see altcoins actually holding back Bitcoin though.\nLogic seems to suggest altcoins all else equal will be holding bitcoins back. Many see bitcoin as an investment, or at the very least hope to not lose money when being in bitcoin over FIAT.\nNow, think of it as odds - what are the odds that their investment in bitcoin will be successful? Between Bitcoin and FIAT it might, for argument's sake) be 20%. So apparently some there is some 20% chance that a shared ledger is such a cool idea that it will succeed (however we want to measure this). So 80% that FIAT will somehow never allow Bitcoin to become anything worth talking about.\nBut if altcoins enter the scene, the odds change.

That is the point. It is not directive issued by someone. It is just \"official\" ascertaining or the market price snapshot.\nWhat we need it for? Firstly it is convenience. Every single merchant don't have to analyse and calculate average price from different major exchanges. Merchant don't have to trust any third party website doing this work for him. As soon as this value is already average for the market and confirmed along with the block it may be well trusted.\nSecondly there are two side effects which I found very nice. We say \"market price\". Who forms that market price? Stock exchange players. It means \"Wall Street\" of the Bitcoin community. Doesn't it look familiar and dull? If we allow any peer offer its price it is going to be more democratic (and fun). If you are fat wallet holder fine bully the price. If you are bitcoin-poor lower it hoping to buy more. Obviously all nonsense offers will be just dumped.\nAnother side effect is that in order to qualify peer's offer algorithm have to compare it with the last confirmed rate. Therefor huge sudden drops or raises due to technical problems in exchanges will be smoother and won't raise panic.
