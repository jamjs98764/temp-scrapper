Gox began operating on a fractional reserve because of the $5 million fine that they were forced to pay by the government? I think the theory stated that the fine was paid by converting BTC into fiat and when BTC prices skyrocketed, it became increasingly difficult for Mt. Gox to pay it off. Does that theory still have merit today or has it been discredited?\nAlso, as the article points out, it was proven on June 2011 that Mt. Gox had control of 424,242 bitcoins which was around the same amount that it was supposed to have back then. This is corroborated by the chart in that article. What isn't explained is the massive drop in BTC reserves immediately after that. If you look at the chart, the line for \"actual BTC\" follows the line for \"expected BTC\" almost perfectly except for the drop in 2011 which happened just after the 424,242 BTC transfer and a minor slipping in the first half of 2012.\nThat puts to rest the \"slow drain\" theory that the exchange constantly lost hundreds of bitcoins per day over the span of many years. If Karpeles and Mt. Gox were unaware of the event in 2011 which caused the expected BTC reserves to diverge so rapidly, then it's very much possible that the discrepancy would have gone unnoticed.\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-04-20 05:35:16", "content": "They were running a fractional reserve and when they were cornered, they blamed it on\nMark's Willy\n.\nYou can see why the exchanges today are so over regulated... this is all related to what happened there at MtGox.... was it not for that event, we would have seen prices exceeding $2000 per Bitcoin.\nIt seems greed has no boundries.\n", "author": "Kprawn Legendary Offline Activity: 1610 Merit: 1048 Make winning bets on sports with Sportsbet.io!

But if the current breed of Bitcoin entrepreneurs continue to screw up as they have done so many times in the past and the old Wall Street types have to step in and take control, then perhaps that represents a failure of one of Bitcoin's supposed benefits.\nThere are good, honest, and technically capable people in the Bitcoin world today. People like Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen have an in-depth understanding of Bitcoin security and probably won't screw their customers due to incompetence in the same way Mt. Gox and BFL did but unfortunately, they're not really businesspeople.\nI proposed the idea of an independent Bitcoin auditing service in\nthis thread\nthat would audit Bitcoin-based businesses using a team of accountants from the old fiat world and Bitcoin experts like Hearn and Andresen.

Do you think that having a Bitcoin auditing business which teams up fiat experts with crypto experts is a good idea?\nI think it is a very good idea.

So, if you are legit and you know this prevents market acceptance, why support anonymity?\nAre we talking about exchanges here or other types of businesses like the ones I previously mentioned which might have a legitimate need to stay anonymous? (e.g. gambling sites, mixers, VPNs, etc.)\nWhen it comes to exchanges, I agree that non-anonymous ones are preferable over anonymous ones but I'd much rather do business with an anonymous exchange that has been running for 3 years without serious issues than a brand new one with no reputation or worse yet, a scammy one that isn't anonymous. I don't know why the owners of BTC-e feel they need to remain anonymous but in a world where 90% of anonymous Bitcoin services have turned out to be scams (plus a good 50-70% of non-anonymous ones), they are probably more of an exception rather than the norm.\nIt's a free market so there will always be anonymous and non-anonymous exchanges, dice sites, mixers, cloud mining firms, investment firms, payment processors, shops, etc. I believe the option of doing business with only those that have passed an auditing process should exist (currently no such auditing services exist) but those who wish to risk their money and do business with non-audited companies which may or may not be anonymous should be free to do so as well.\nIf enough people choose to stay away from businesses with anonymous owners, then they will go out of business or their owners will be forced to reveal their identities so if you believe that anonymous owners are a problem, then it's a self-correcting one.\nAnd there are plenty of companies that turned out to be scams where the owners were publicly known. For example, BFL, Mt. Gox, the Moolah CEO, etc.\nWouldn't the audit need to be repeated, every single minute, by an automated process, that locks down the exchange and if necessary doublespends hacked\nBTC\nwith a higher fee to an emergency evac address, as soon as any funny business is detected?\nFrequent audits would be preferable but it wouldn't need to be any more or less frequent than those for non-Bitcoin businesses. Mt. Gox was audited in 2011 but the results of that audit had no relevance by the time it collapsed in 2014. An audit once or twice every year or so would have been much better since even a yearly audit would have found serious problems with the exchange much earlier compared to not doing one at all.\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-04-22 09:30:54", "content": "Yes\n", "author": "BIT-Sharon Sr. Member Offline Activity: 266 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-04-22 10:08:14", "content": "The real problem is...who's paying the auditors and who do they work for?\nThe last thing you want is a conflict of interest where the exchanges in question are hiring their own auditors under the table.\nBut the companies do hire and pay the auditors, that's how it works.

What I wonder is how does one become official cryptocurrency expert. There is no officially recognised qualifications/certificates afaik, although Princeton University offers some Bitcoin course, but don't know about anything else.\nSo far, it has mostly been the developers who did the audits:\nCurrently, the most suitable people to audit Bitcoin exchanges are people who have an in-depth understanding of Bitcoin - e.g. people like Roger Ver (who audited Mt. Gox in 2011), Andreas Antonopoulos (who audited Coinbase), Mike Hearn (who audited Bitstamp), and Stefan Thomas (who audited Kraken).\nThis won't be scalable once more and more businesses start popping up though so you do have a good point. Since cryptocurrencies are such a new thing, experience in the field is probably more important at this stage than having a degree although having the latter also helps. For example, I'd much rather trust someone like Vitalik Buterin (who despite not having a degree, knows far more about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies than most people) to audit an exchange than your typical comp sci graduate who probably doesn't know a thing about Bitcoin.\nAs for what academic degrees might be of most relevance to being a Bitcoin expert, computer science and a cryptography are the majors that come to mind. Even so, someone with degrees in either or both these fields would still need to be highly familiar with how Bitcoin works in order to call themselves a Bitcoin expert.\nThere's a huge demand in my opinion, but the biggest problem is: Who should we trust? The general consensus here is that it should be some sort of 'respected' authority in the financial world. Some sort of independent party.

Well, I think Kraken did something like that though, didn't they? Back in Gox's big days they still proved their BTC-wise solvency by sending around a huge transaction...\nKraken passed an audit by Ripple developer Stefan Thomas which only looked at their BTC reserves:\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/krakens-audit-proves-holds-100-bitcoins-reserve/\nProof of reserves is only one step towards a full-scale audit. It's much, much better than nothing, but a truly comprehensive audit should also look at the fiat side of things to insure that the exchange isn't actually insolvent (since they could have purchased the coins with their customers' fiat deposits) as well as how their security is set up and what security measures are in place to protect against the possibility of future attacks.\nSince there's high competition between exchanges, hopefully some of them will opt for voluntary audit and gain the advantage over competitors showing they have nothing to hide. I'm surprised we haven't seen that yet.\nSome exchanges have already opted to undergo a voluntary audit (see the examples in my original post) although most of these weren't as comprehensive as full audits for the reasons I mentioned above.\nIf you want to prevent a second MtGox, you have to audit these exchanges on a regular basis. From what I have read recently, the supposed &lt;hack&gt; at MtGox, was due to small amounts being stolen on a daily basis. This would have been prevented, if it was audited regularly.\nYes, regular audits are good. Mt. Gox was audited in 2011 but the results of this audit had no relevance by 2014.\nThere are even some people, who are asking for a Crypto currency audit on the protocol level for all Alt coins.\nThe auditing process for an altcoin is pretty much just a code review, isn't it? That's far easier to do, especially since no fiat is involved and most altcoins don't differ significantly from Bitcoin/Litecoin. I think many exchanges already look at the code of new altcoins before they add it to their exchange. I know Poloniex does this for all their new coins.\nThere is a demand for an organization which audits some of the major bitcoin exchanges, these exchanges require documents from the users according KYC/ AML policies , and we should also like wise get an independent third party audit of these exchanges.

Hence my question above.\nWell of course the more frequently the audits are done, the safer it is security-wise. But eventually you reach a point where it would become impractical. If Mt. Gox chose to audit themselves every year, then at least the damage would have been minimized to a single year and detected much sooner vs. not being audited at all which was the actual situation. Those who believe that yearly audits to be too infrequent could take their business to another exchange that might offer more frequent audits as a bonus security feature (although the costs would probably be translated to higher fees).

Not completely of course, but the use of WIR helps to stabilise the economy as a whole and indirectly affects the stability of the Swiss Franc.\nBeing a relatively small group (&gt;60K members) does instill a sense of a group willing to help each other out.\nGoods can be paid part in CHF and part in WIR. Mortgages can be partly taken out in WIR if the constructor or third party accepts it; rates seem to be fixed at 1%.\nHow the Money supply of WIR is changed, introduced; I do not know. Through mortgages? and the % charged becomes a profit to the bank which then gets redistributed to its members?\nOverall, it is closely tied to the Swiss franc and makes it vulnerable to sabotage by these traitors.\nIt does help to bring balance and stability by being extremely focused on small enterprises, fosters collaboration and supports locally produced goods and services. Members have a share in the Bank and participate in the profits. Fees are taken on the receiving end of a transaction for 1%. It would seem thus that these fees generated can re-enter the economy through the notes held by its members.\nMaybe something can be applied to bitcoin here.

Gox began operating on a fractional reserve because of the $5 million fine that they were forced to pay by the government? I think the theory stated that the fine was paid by converting BTC into fiat and when BTC prices skyrocketed, it became increasingly difficult for Mt. Gox to pay it off. Does that theory still have merit today or has it been discredited?\nAlso, as the article points out, it was proven on June 2011 that Mt. Gox had control of 424,242 bitcoins which was around the same amount that it was supposed to have back then. This is corroborated by the chart in that article. What isn't explained is the massive drop in BTC reserves immediately after that. If you look at the chart, the line for \"actual BTC\" follows the line for \"expected BTC\" almost perfectly except for the drop in 2011 which happened just after the 424,242 BTC transfer and a minor slipping in the first half of 2012.\nThat puts to rest the \"slow drain\" theory that the exchange constantly lost hundreds of bitcoins per day over the span of many years. If Karpeles and Mt. Gox were unaware of the event in 2011 which caused the expected BTC reserves to diverge so rapidly, then it's very much possible that the discrepancy would have gone unnoticed.\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-04-20 05:35:16", "content": "They were running a fractional reserve and when they were cornered, they blamed it on\nMark's Willy\n.\nYou can see why the exchanges today are so over regulated... this is all related to what happened there at MtGox.... was it not for that event, we would have seen prices exceeding $2000 per Bitcoin.\nIt seems greed has no boundries.\n", "author": "Kprawn Legendary Offline Activity: 1610 Merit: 1048 Make winning bets on sports with Sportsbet.io!

But if the current breed of Bitcoin entrepreneurs continue to screw up as they have done so many times in the past and the old Wall Street types have to step in and take control, then perhaps that represents a failure of one of Bitcoin's supposed benefits.\nThere are good, honest, and technically capable people in the Bitcoin world today. People like Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen have an in-depth understanding of Bitcoin security and probably won't screw their customers due to incompetence in the same way Mt. Gox and BFL did but unfortunately, they're not really businesspeople.\nI proposed the idea of an independent Bitcoin auditing service in\nthis thread\nthat would audit Bitcoin-based businesses using a team of accountants from the old fiat world and Bitcoin experts like Hearn and Andresen.

So, if you are legit and you know this prevents market acceptance, why support anonymity?\nAre we talking about exchanges here or other types of businesses like the ones I previously mentioned which might have a legitimate need to stay anonymous? (e.g. gambling sites, mixers, VPNs, etc.)\nWhen it comes to exchanges, I agree that non-anonymous ones are preferable over anonymous ones but I'd much rather do business with an anonymous exchange that has been running for 3 years without serious issues than a brand new one with no reputation or worse yet, a scammy one that isn't anonymous. I don't know why the owners of BTC-e feel they need to remain anonymous but in a world where 90% of anonymous Bitcoin services have turned out to be scams (plus a good 50-70% of non-anonymous ones), they are probably more of an exception rather than the norm.\nIt's a free market so there will always be anonymous and non-anonymous exchanges, dice sites, mixers, cloud mining firms, investment firms, payment processors, shops, etc. I believe the option of doing business with only those that have passed an auditing process should exist (currently no such auditing services exist) but those who wish to risk their money and do business with non-audited companies which may or may not be anonymous should be free to do so as well.\nIf enough people choose to stay away from businesses with anonymous owners, then they will go out of business or their owners will be forced to reveal their identities so if you believe that anonymous owners are a problem, then it's a self-correcting one.\nAnd there are plenty of companies that turned out to be scams where the owners were publicly known. For example, BFL, Mt. Gox, the Moolah CEO, etc.\nWouldn't the audit need to be repeated, every single minute, by an automated process, that locks down the exchange and if necessary doublespends hacked\nBTC\nwith a higher fee to an emergency evac address, as soon as any funny business is detected?\nFrequent audits would be preferable but it wouldn't need to be any more or less frequent than those for non-Bitcoin businesses. Mt. Gox was audited in 2011 but the results of that audit had no relevance by the time it collapsed in 2014. An audit once or twice every year or so would have been much better since even a yearly audit would have found serious problems with the exchange much earlier compared to not doing one at all.\n", "author": "Bizmark13 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 448 Merit: 250 WikiScams.org - Information about Bitcoin Scams "}, {"date": "2015-04-22 09:30:54", "content": "Yes\n", "author": "BIT-Sharon Sr. Member Offline Activity: 266 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-04-22 10:08:14", "content": "The real problem is...who's paying the auditors and who do they work for?\nThe last thing you want is a conflict of interest where the exchanges in question are hiring their own auditors under the table.\nBut the companies do hire and pay the auditors, that's how it works. But as Bizmark13 said, no audit firm will damage their reputation by accepting the bribe. Look at what happened to Arthur Andersen LLP after the Enron scandal (no bribe involved, but failed to do the job properly), they pretty much don't exist anymore and they were one of the 'Big Five'.\nIt's more likely that a real auditing firm would get some Bitcoin expertise if they needed to audit a Bitcoin-oriented firm.

What I wonder is how does one become official cryptocurrency expert. There is no officially recognised qualifications/certificates afaik, although Princeton University offers some Bitcoin course, but don't know about anything else.\nSo far, it has mostly been the developers who did the audits:\nCurrently, the most suitable people to audit Bitcoin exchanges are people who have an in-depth understanding of Bitcoin - e.g. people like Roger Ver (who audited Mt. Gox in 2011), Andreas Antonopoulos (who audited Coinbase), Mike Hearn (who audited Bitstamp), and Stefan Thomas (who audited Kraken).\nThis won't be scalable once more and more businesses start popping up though so you do have a good point. Since cryptocurrencies are such a new thing, experience in the field is probably more important at this stage than having a degree although having the latter also helps. For example, I'd much rather trust someone like Vitalik Buterin (who despite not having a degree, knows far more about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies than most people) to audit an exchange than your typical comp sci graduate who probably doesn't know a thing about Bitcoin.\nAs for what academic degrees might be of most relevance to being a Bitcoin expert, computer science and a cryptography are the majors that come to mind. Even so, someone with degrees in either or both these fields would still need to be highly familiar with how Bitcoin works in order to call themselves a Bitcoin expert.\nThere's a huge demand in my opinion, but the biggest problem is: Who should we trust? The general consensus here is that it should be some sort of 'respected' authority in the financial world. Some sort of independent party.

Well, I think Kraken did something like that though, didn't they? Back in Gox's big days they still proved their BTC-wise solvency by sending around a huge transaction...\nKraken passed an audit by Ripple developer Stefan Thomas which only looked at their BTC reserves:\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/krakens-audit-proves-holds-100-bitcoins-reserve/\nProof of reserves is only one step towards a full-scale audit. It's much, much better than nothing, but a truly comprehensive audit should also look at the fiat side of things to insure that the exchange isn't actually insolvent (since they could have purchased the coins with their customers' fiat deposits) as well as how their security is set up and what security measures are in place to protect against the possibility of future attacks.\nSince there's high competition between exchanges, hopefully some of them will opt for voluntary audit and gain the advantage over competitors showing they have nothing to hide. I'm surprised we haven't seen that yet.\nSome exchanges have already opted to undergo a voluntary audit (see the examples in my original post) although most of these weren't as comprehensive as full audits for the reasons I mentioned above.\nIf you want to prevent a second MtGox, you have to audit these exchanges on a regular basis. From what I have read recently, the supposed &lt;hack&gt; at MtGox, was due to small amounts being stolen on a daily basis. This would have been prevented, if it was audited regularly.\nYes, regular audits are good. Mt. Gox was audited in 2011 but the results of this audit had no relevance by 2014.\nThere are even some people, who are asking for a Crypto currency audit on the protocol level for all Alt coins.\nThe auditing process for an altcoin is pretty much just a code review, isn't it? That's far easier to do, especially since no fiat is involved and most altcoins don't differ significantly from Bitcoin/Litecoin. I think many exchanges already look at the code of new altcoins before they add it to their exchange. I know Poloniex does this for all their new coins.\nThere is a demand for an organization which audits some of the major bitcoin exchanges, these exchanges require documents from the users according KYC/ AML policies , and we should also like wise get an independent third party audit of these exchanges. These auditing reports will ensure that these exchanges are transparent and are running fair business.\nAgreed.\nWouldn't the audit need to be repeated, every single minute, by an automated process, that locks down the exchange and if necessary doublespends hacked\nBTC\nwith a higher fee to an emergency evac address, as soon as any funny business is detected?\nFrequent audits would be preferable but it wouldn't need to be any more or less frequent than those for non-Bitcoin businesses.

So if another audit had been done a year later, it would been the better part of 365 days too late. Hence my question above.\nWell of course the more frequently the audits are done, the safer it is security-wise. But eventually you reach a point where it would become impractical. If Mt. Gox chose to audit themselves every year, then at least the damage would have been minimized to a single year and detected much sooner vs. not being audited at all which was the actual situation. Those who believe that yearly audits to be too infrequent could take their business to another exchange that might offer more frequent audits as a bonus security feature (although the costs would probably be translated to higher fees).
