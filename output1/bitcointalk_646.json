That would be a very serious problem, but considering that ECC is used not only for bitcoin it might be worse for other systems.\nIt is certainly possible to switch to an algorithm that is considered to be safe in such an event, but AFAIK its a hard fork.\nLooking forward to what LaudaM might offer.  I guess I more or less have the same understanding as what you expressed, Shorena.\nI guess my question was mainly aimed at that \"hard fork\" you were talking about.  It seems like it woulnd't be enough to merely switch to a new signature algorithm, because what about all the old UTXOs that are only secured with the broken signatures (and whose pubkeys have been revealed)?  Wouldn't there have to be some desperate action to keep all of those vunerable UTXOs from being spent by an attacker?\nAnyway, I'm not too worried about this scenario, I'm just curious to here from people with a better understanding than me exactly what the ramifications might be for changing sig algos.\n", "author": "tspacepilot Legendary Offline Activity: 1456 Merit: 1013 I may write code in exchange for bitcoins.

The Eliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (for those that do not know) is used for signing transactions in Bitcoin. To simplify, if the algorithm gets broken, anyone with a quantum computer\ncould extract a private key from any public key\nand take the Bitcoin stored on it.\nHowever, this is not even remotely as simple as people seem to think. The public key of an address isn't really made public, but your Bitcoin address is (which is a hash of it). In other words, a quantum computer can't derive the public key from your Bitcoin address. Also by the time someone computes your private key and manages to import it you could already send your funds elsewhere.\nSymmetric ciphers are theoretically weakened by quantum computing, but not much and certainly not fatally. Quantum computers could effectively cut symmetric key sizes in half, so a 128-bit key space becomes a 64-bit key space when attacked by a quantum computer, meaning that a QC would need to perform some 2^64 sequential operations, after taking advantage of the parallelism provided by superposition. It's likely that no QC will ever be fast enough to make that feasible. But if one ever is, we can always just bump the key size to 256 bits. Bottom line: symmetric cryptography is not threatened by QC.\nThis also applies to SHA256 which is a symmetric cipher. There was a number of thread on how this would be exploited. Even if it was, the least of our problems would be Bitcoin. Quantum computers can not even break a 128-bit key (in a short period of time), even though a lot of people here believe otherwise. Quantum computers are not infinitely powerful computers. They just work differently and are better at some tasks while being worse at others than traditional computers.\nI would also like to state that I do not think that this is going to be a problem within the next 10-15 years. I'm assuming that is why there isn't that much public talk about this. The developers could work on changing the algorithm and apply that fix within the next hard fork that we're going to have. However, who is to say that the\nnew algorithm\nwon't be vulnerable in 10 years?\nIf you would like to view the whole creation process of the address (it's not just the following: private key - public key - address),\npress this link.\nUpdate:\nNonsense.\nI wouldn't even know where to begin with your post.\n", "author": "Lauda Legendary Offline Activity: 1974 Merit: 1585 GUNBOT Licenses up to 70% OFF - 'GrumpyKitty'.

Interesting tidbits from the article: \"'I'm genuinely worried we're not going to be ready in time,' says Michele Mosca, co-founder of the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) at the University of Waterloo...\" and \"Intelligence agencies have also taken notice. On August 11, the US National Security Agency (NSA) revealed its intention to transition to quantum-resistant protocols when it released security recommendations to its vendors and clients.\" Another concern is \"intercept now, decrypt later\", which presumably refers to the giant facility in Utah.\nIn related news, an anonymous reader points out that the NSA has updated a page on its website, announcing plans to shift the encryption of government and military data from current cryptographic schemes to new ones that can resist an attack by quantum computers.\nThen I looked a bit at the wikipedia page on elliptic curve cryptography and it seems that ECC is especially vuneralble to quantum attacks compared to RSA crypto of equivalent key lengths.  From what I understand, the main advanage to date of ECC over RSA is that you can get equivalent security for shorter key-lengths.  A 256bit ECC key is supposed to provide security on the order of like a 1028bit RSA key. However, apparantely quantum computers nullify this advanage.\nDoes this have ramifications for bitcoin?  In a worst-case scenario in which our fundamental crypto is broken, would bitcoin be able to upgrade the protocol to use a different crypto system?  How would the UTXO set be secured?\nThanks in advance for educating me you guys.\nI hope LaudaM chimes in.\nBitcoins main defense against quantum attacks are the hashes. Assuming ECC is broken and a private key can be calculated from a public key within reasonable time, youd still have to get the public key first.

You realize that it is more like a democracy? Gavin and Hearn can't take away bitcoin. Every user of bitcoin votes what he wants to use. Core or XT.

The Eliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (for those that do not know) is used for signing transactions in Bitcoin. To simplify, if the algorithm gets broken, anyone with a quantum computer\ncould extract a private key from any public key\nand take the Bitcoin stored on it.\nHowever, this is not even remotely as simple as people seem to think. The public key of an address isn't really made public, but your Bitcoin address is (which is a hash of it). In other words, a quantum computer can't derive the public key from your Bitcoin address. Also by the time someone computes your private key and manages to import it you could already send your funds elsewhere.\nSymmetric ciphers are theoretically weakened by quantum computing, but not much and certainly not fatally. Quantum computers could effectively cut symmetric key sizes in half, so a 128-bit key space becomes a 64-bit key space when attacked by a quantum computer, meaning that a QC would need to perform some 2^64 sequential operations, after taking advantage of the parallelism provided by superposition. It's likely that no QC will ever be fast enough to make that feasible. But if one ever is, we can always just bump the key size to 256 bits. Bottom line: symmetric cryptography is not threatened by QC.\nThis also applies to SHA256 which is a symmetric cipher. There was a number of thread on how this would be exploited. Even if it was, the least of our problems would be Bitcoin. Quantum computers can not even break a 128-bit key (in a short period of time), even though a lot of people here believe otherwise. Quantum computers are not infinitely powerful computers. They just work differently and are better at some tasks while being worse at others than traditional computers.\nI would also like to state that I do not think that this is going to be a problem within the next 10-15 years. I'm assuming that is why there isn't that much public talk about this. The developers could work on changing the algorithm and apply that fix within the next hard fork that we're going to have. However, who is to say that the\nnew algorithm\nwon't be vulnerable in 10 years?\nIf you would like to view the whole creation process of the address (it's not just the following: private key - public key - address),\npress this link.\nUpdate:\nNonsense.\nI wouldn't even know where to begin with your post.\n", "author": "Lauda Legendary Offline Activity: 1974 Merit: 1585 GUNBOT Licenses up to 70% OFF - 'GrumpyKitty'.

Who should decide what should be included and what should not be? It is better no one should be allow to change the protocol unless in a clear and real crisis that is understandable for everyone.

You've seemingly totally missed the point of the whole anonymous act.\nBitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it.  By doing a fork in this way, these developers are violating the \"original vision\" they claim to honour.\nYes, his words. I don't await him coming out publicly showing his face.\nBut i think you made a good point why he won't say anything. He most probably knows that every agency in the world is interested in his identity. Him speaking now would be way too risky. The NSA or so could find out who he is pretty easy probably.
