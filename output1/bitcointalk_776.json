A pure peer to peer version of the exchange system would allow all parties access to the market without relying on any central organization for market access. Paper proposes a solution for the problem of maintain an order book and determine the execution rate in the peer to peer network.

The paper defines basic ground rules for the working of decentralized exchange. The major components of the decentralized exchange are issuing process, co-existence of blockchain and order books and functions of the miner. Unlike other crypto currencies de-centralized exchange would have a trust based issuing process which in long run would be a sum zero game.

I don't see how this can actually work.\nPlease explain how the system would work in this very simple scenario:\nPerson A wants to sell 1 BTC for 100 LTC. This offer is stored in the orderbook.\nPerson B is willing to take on this offer and buy 1 BTC for 100 LTC.\nHow are the following points ensured?\nBefore making the offer to sell 1 BTC, person A should prove that he actually controls that amount (and that this BTC will not be sent somewhere else as long as the offer is in the orderbook.)\nBefore taking on this offer, person B should prove that she controls 100 LTC.\nWhen the deal is complete, ownership of the 1 BTC should be transferred to B, and ownership of the 100 LTC should be transferred to A. The previous owners must not be able to access the coins anymore.\nA centralized exchange acts as an escrow for the traded coins, and a Ripple-like system has multiple gateways that each act as escrow for the coins they hold (even though actual trades are performed within Ripple). Of course you need to trust the exchange or gateway if you want to trade on such a market, but these are most often identifiable entities.\nWho fills this role in a truly decentralized exchange?\nOnkel Paul\n(PS sorry that I did not yet read the paper, will do it later today when I've got time.

The created FI's are granted to Traders/ Users. The users Broadcast the open orders for One Financial instrument to exchange other financial instrument. When a countering order is met then a execution order is generated which is verified by miners and complied into block chain.

I don't see how this can actually work.\nPlease explain how the system would work in this very simple scenario:\nPerson A wants to sell 1 BTC for 100 LTC. This offer is stored in the orderbook.\nPerson B is willing to take on this offer and buy 1 BTC for 100 LTC.\nHow are the following points ensured?\nBefore making the offer to sell 1 BTC, person A should prove that he actually controls that amount (and that this BTC will not be sent somewhere else as long as the offer is in the orderbook.)\nBefore taking on this offer, person B should prove that she controls 100 LTC.\nWhen the deal is complete, ownership of the 1 BTC should be transferred to B, and ownership of the 100 LTC should be transferred to A. The previous owners must not be able to access the coins anymore.\nA centralized exchange acts as an escrow for the traded coins, and a Ripple-like system has multiple gateways that each act as escrow for the coins they hold (even though actual trades are performed within Ripple). Of course you need to trust the exchange or gateway if you want to trade on such a market, but these are most often identifiable entities.\nWho fills this role in a truly decentralized exchange?\nOnkel Paul\n(PS sorry that I did not yet read the paper, will do it later today when I've got time.

Instead it would be a issuer who is created out of chain of trust entrusted by issuing token's. The tokens can be used to create and issue Financial instruments. Which can be commodities or currencies or even tickets based on dynamic pricing etc. The issuer can issue the financial instrument only ones he has created. The created FI's are granted to Traders/ Users. The users Broadcast the open orders for One Financial instrument to exchange other financial instrument. When a countering order is met then a execution order is generated which is verified by miners and complied into block chain. The execution order determines price of exchange for two financial instruments. Similarly the market exit could be facilitated by Issue in terms of withdrawal by traders.\nMoreover ripple is kinda private controlled.

The issuers in such a system take bitcoins or any other asset they're willing to hold from you, store them and issue tokens which then can be traded (just like the IOUs in Ripple).\nWhen you're done with your trades, you can take the tokens and redeem them for the real thing at the issuer. So as long as the token circulates within the exchange, the issuer stores the actual value (we hope). So far this is all not very surprising if you know how Ripple works\nThe main difference might be that this approach aims to achieve a truly decentralized exchange network, something that Ripple didn't fully achieve yet as far as I can determine. However, I don't know whether it is possible to build a blockchain-like thing that performs well enough for block times in the area of 10-60 seconds.\nNote that my Ripple comparisons are not meant to endorse that system - it's just the distributed exchange system that I've studied most, so I'm using it to draw analogies and try to understand how things are supposed to work.\nOnkel Paul\n", "author": "OnkelPaul Legendary Offline Activity: 1044 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-10-14 13:40:33", "content": "We no longer have to hold any Bitcoin on Exchange\nIs there a downside on this?\n", "author": "n0rBit Newbie Offline Activity: 21 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2014-10-14 17:06:29", "content": "Instead it would be a issuer who is created out of chain of trust entrusted by issuing token's.\nAnd in what way are these 'tokens' not a coin?\nI presume you've done your research into NXT and BitsharesX?\nThe function of issuing token is as follows\nTo create Financial instruments .\nTo delegate the authority of Issuer to another issuer.  ( A issuer can delegate issuing token only once.

In a pure decentralized exchange the Issuer's handles the role of custodian.  In a traditional scenarios only one custodian handles all the gates for the market place. Hence making the entire market extremely vulnerable to default risk by a single custodian. Like in the case of MTgox. But if Custodian's itself are decentralised then the risk of single custodian defaulting is minimized drastically.\n", "author": "market.dex Newbie Offline Activity: 8 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2014-10-14 17:23:12", "content": "In your system who is the trusted party that holds the fiat?\n", "author": "QuestionAuthority Legendary Offline Activity: 1960 Merit: 1315 You lead and I'll watch you walk away.
