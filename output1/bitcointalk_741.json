{"post_problems": [{"content": "The recent video by James DeAngelo from the World Bitcoin Network had some really deep and profound insights on how voting is flawed in Congress and proposes a $5 cardboard box solution.\nIf you missed the video, be sure to check it out at:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gEz__sMVaY\nIt's interesting how Congress works behind the scenes sometimes...\nAlong the same line...\nLast year, I was on a business trip to Rhode Island and had the opportunity to run into a health care industry lobbyist named, Brian Files who seemed very knowledgeable about the inner workings of the U.S. Congress and how laws and stuff get passed in America.\nBeing a the bitcoin supporter that I am... out of curiosity... I asked Brian if he had ever heard of bitcoin and what his thoughts were on it... and if he had heard anything through the \"grapevines\" about bitcoin on Capital Hill?\nBrian shared with me some profound insights on what it would take for Bitcoin to succeed from a legal and legislative perspective.  It was some fascinating stuff so I asked him if I could record our conversation and share it with the bitcoin community so everyone can benefit from it.\nHere is the 4 part interview:\nhttp://prisonorfreedom.com/1-of-4-u-s-lobbyist-explains-his-1st-impressions-of-bitcoins-by-u-s-lobbyist-brian-files/\nhttp://prisonorfreedom.com/2-of-4-why-bitcoin-needs-a-grassroots-plan-to-bypass-big-banks-big-energy-in-congress-by-u-s-lobbyist-brian-files/\nhttp://prisonorfreedom.com/3-of-4-why-bitcoin-has-to-become-legal-tender-in-order-to-succeed-by-u-s-lobbyist-brian-files/\nhttp://prisonorfreedom.com/4-of-4-how-to-lobby-lawmakers-to-embrace-bitcoin-by-u-s-lobbyist-brian-files/\nSimilar to James DeAngelo's video about the cardboard box reform... Brian does a good job explaining the problems that bitcoin will face from a legislative perspective and then he shares what he believes to be a possible solution to overcoming those challenges.\nLet me know what you guys think about the interview especially about the grassroots approach that Brian talks about in the interview.\nIn part 2, Brian talks about how it will be a tough battle to get pass the big banks and big energy lobbyist in congress... Can bitcoin go head to head with the big banks and big energy lobbyists?\nI think we need someone like Brian Files on bitcoin's side!  LOL! The Bitcoin Foundation can definitely use him for sure when it comes to lobbying for bitcoin...
