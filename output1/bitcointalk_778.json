Post your thoughts here.\nObjective\nSet up a Credit Union where Bitcoin users can set up direct deposit at work directly to a Bitcoin address. This will be the main function of the Credit Union initially with the ability to expand into other services down the road.\nApproach\nCredit Unions are not as difficult to get running as one might think. The main initial steps are setting up a business plan and getting signatures from those that might be willing to join. The goal will be to get 3,000 people to support the concept while less is still ok but makes things more difficult. 500 people will be the minimum. Focusing on a simple initial setup of direct deposit will allow us to apply for an Express Charter and will make it more likely that the Credit Union will be approved.\nWhat we need to begin\nThere are 10 main steps to setting up a Credit Union:\n1. Find something in common (Bitcoin users)\n2. Get together. A \"yes\" vote by 500 members while 3000 will help the process.\n3. Do the paperwork. There will be plenty of forms to be filled out and submitted.\n4. Meet the membership requirement. We will need to get signatures and a survey from the potential members.\n5. Find a financial expert. We need a CPA or someone good with accounting for the organizing committee.\n6. Form a committee. A small amount of people to help organize with good financial history.\n7. Set up a board of directors. We will vote on who we want for the initial board of directors.\n8. Collect money. To help with the initial funding we will need funds to get the ball rolling whether through donations or initial membership fee.\n9. Charter assistance. It would be useful to have the assistance of someone who has already set up a Credit Union to help review our submission.\n10. Apply for status. Petition the National Credit Union Administration for official status.\nInitial business plan\nThe goal is to make direct deposit to a Bitcoin address as simple as possible. A Bitcoin user will join the Bitcoin Credit Union with the same process as joining a bank or credit union. They will provide a deposit Bitcoin address. The Bitcoin Credit Union will provide an account address. The Bitcoin user will provide the direct deposit account to their employer and when they are paid the funds will be converted to bitcoins and deposited into their account. From the user this process will be transparent. The Bitcoin Credit Union will coordinate with a company/companies to provide the best exchange rate. The members will decide whether day to day operations are paid for via the initial membership fee or from a small percentage taken during the conversion. The goal will be to keep the cost down as low as possible using volunteers as much as possible for operations.\nIf you made it this far and are interested, sign up here to help move this forward.\nhttp://www.bitpools.com/?Bitcoin%20Credit%20Union\n", "views": 3161, "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWould you be interested in a Bitcoin Credit Union?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-10-04 11:07:15", "content": "arnt you already describing coinbase lol\nmany people already treat exchanges as a form of credit union (little shrimp, not whales)\nalthough making it as a 'formal' credit union might be useful.\nit can work as a little shrimp savings thing. but i would not aim it at large whales. that way its much easier to obtain liability insurance as each account can be secured against say $2k. much cheaper to insure rather than policies of $250k per account holder (banking world).\nid never recommend storing bitcoin in third parties without proper insurance. thus small account limits and affordable insurance will win this project passing the feasibility tests.\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-10-04 11:07:29", "content": "arnt you already describing coinbase lol\nmany people already treat exchanges as a form of credit union (little shrimp, not whales)\nWhile this can be done via coinbase by setting up some sort of automation, with a credit union people can skip the step of money flowing through their bank account and the problems that come with having a bank account.\nThis would be like BitPay but in reverse.

That would make things difficult. I was focusing on the US, I guess I should have clarified that. I have a credit union account with an account number and checks and everything a bank has. I can do ACH transfers, etc. A credit union is member owned, is usually for a specific purpose and not as complicated as a bank.\nIn the US when you go to get paid they ask for your direct deposit routing number and account number. The routing number is the number for the financial institution and the account number references your account. If we can get a routing number we can set up the account numbers to point to a specific Bitcoin address.\nI think if we could do like BitPay does where companies that want to accept Bitcoin with no desire to deal in Bitcoin can do so, but we can set it up so that people who are paid in fiat with no desire to deal in fiat can do so.

I can't think of any user that can pay all of their bills in bitcoin. So in the ideal situation, one would set up an account, designate a percentage of their pay to be converted to bitcoins, while the rest remains as cash in their account, accessible via ATM or check.\nIf you're not willing to go all the way and offer fiat banking services as well as bitcoin services, then there's really no advantage to this credit union idea compared to just getting paid as normal and having coo base make regular purchases from you linked bank account. If anything the later would be easier, since, again, people, do need a certain amount of fiat to survive.

(gives the 'unbanked' staff a method to get paid)\n2) we get more merchants to accept bitcoin from customers\n3) we get merchants suppliers to accept bitcoinso that merchants can pay direct without conversion\n3) merchants that will help peoples daily 'survival' (minimal daily needs(food, clothing landlords, toiletries, home repair))\n4) we get merchants to KEEP bitcoin, to then pay staff (as average joe adoption grows)\n5) by this point alot of merchants will pay staff direct in bitcoin without need of credit union. but fiat still exists and a credit union still has usefulness\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-10-04 22:12:12", "content": "a credit union has purpose and passes the test of time of a 5 year lifespan. thus worth achieving. and it can be an integral part of bitcoin growth and adoption.\nit does not need physical locations in every town. as bitcoin ATM's dotted around can fill that gap\nid say once credit unions are set up, for those employees wanting bitcoin or even just wanting a 'account' to receive wages into. we then push for more merchants to accept bitcoin as a customer payment method. seriously concentrating on the 'home basics' of life, rather than luxuries.\nthen and only then is it ready to push the mass adoption of average joe to convert to bitcoin either directly from merchants accepting bitcoins or through merchants sending fiat to credit union.\nthis allows a period of time from starting the credit union and refining it, before mass adoption.\nthe merchant push inbetween is critical, and i hate people that simply think USER adoption in 2014 is key.\nso in 2014-2015 i see the credit union being small and stable growth of existing userbase. which is good and practical. then once people can live on bitcoins we really push the mass adoption in 2015+\nanother thing that would also help the community was if we pooled in all the bitcoin ATM people and instead of them individually paying for money transfer licences each. that thy work as 'agents' /franchisee's of the credit union. thus they still do what they do but instead of 20 people in one state paying 1 licence each. they payjust 5% and be still licenced, as they are under the umbrella of the credit union brand.\nfood for thought\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-10-04 22:16:50", "content": "Setting up a physical location and going through the legal process is a multiple year project and involves millions of dollars in lawyer and regulatory fees.

Focusing first solely on direct deposit would bring the price much lower.\nThe BitPay payroll is trying to get companies to sign up to pay their employees in Bitcoin. But matching companies that pay in Bitcoin and people who want to be paid in Bitcoin will be a small number.\nThe price may be as low as it is because so many people are clinging on to the fiat world so much that the concept of getting paid in Bitcoin and converting to fiat for those few things they need to pay for is a scary concept.\nI, for one, get paid in dollars and live on euros in Germany.

But if we got the exchange price as close to 0% as possible (contracting with companies that need fiat for bitcoins) then it would be just like being paid in bitcoins. Then you could convert what you need in fiat via CoinBase or use a bitcoin debit card or the many other ways of getting fiat for bitcoins.\nYou can set up Coinbase to do an automatic buy, it would have to be timed the day you get paid and if your pay goes up or down it would not be able to fluctuate. Plus it takes several days for the transfer to go through. And you need a bank account for this, which would be more likely to freeze your account with no legal recourse as opposed to the government shutting down a whole credit union without any legal recourse.\nWith direct deposits people actually are given the option of never having a bank account ever again.

The terminals are standalone touch-screen machines with black-and-white stripes painted on their cases.\nBadea said his companys terminals will remove the complications associated with buying bitcoin for Romanians, explaining that in the past the countrys bitcoin buyers have had to deal with know-your-customer regulations, creating accounts on various exchange platforms and ensuring their bank accounts could send funds to exchanges outside the country.\nHe said:\nThere is a [bitcoin] community here, thats for sure. There are lots of people who know about bitcoin, but they dont have the opportunity to try it. It was too complicated before.\nThe Cointrader exchange was set up by Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs, which operates the first bitcoin ATM, located in the Waves Coffeehouse there.\nTerminal network competition\nZebraPay is working to add bitcoin as a payment option for the other services it offers through its terminals by the years end, Badea said. The terminals allow customers to buy mobile phone credit, pay utility bills and settle traffic fines, among other functions.\nZebraPay terminals also offer Ukash, a type of electronic money, that is popular for online games and gambling, Badea said.\nThe ZebraPay network is set to grow about 30% by years end, adding 350 new terminals by 2015, Badea said. Its machines are located in 160 cities across Romania in large supermarket chains like Carrefour, Auchan and Kaufland  some of the biggest retailers in the country.\nZebraPay competes with Qiwi in Romania. The Nasdaq-listed Russian payments giant has a network of 171,000 payments terminals and kiosks in seven countries, largely concentrated in Russia and Kazakhstan, according to its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and has also reported that it hosts 15.5 million virtual wallets, which are mainly used for remittance services. Qiwi doesnt report terminal numbers for individual countries.\nSOURCE:\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/800-payment-terminals-romania-now-sell-bitcoin/\n", "views": 764, "author": "Coinbuddy Hero Member Offline Activity: 896 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOver 800 Payment Terminals in Romania Now Sell Bitcoin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2014-10-11 08:10:13"}, {"content": "Today, Kevin Sweeney, Director of Engineering at Vimeo, posted on Twitter that the video-sharing website wants to integrate Bitcoin into its payment system and is currently in the process of working through the red tape.\nBitPay was quick to make a tweet offering its services to the company:\nLately, Bitcoin has been on a roll with merchants like Overstock.com, Dish Network, and PayPal announcing payment integrations. Many experts are speculating that soon digital currencies like Bitcoin will become commonplace across the entire globe.\nVimeo is a U.S.-based video-sharing website on which users can upload, share and view videos. The company was founded in November 2004. As of December 2013, Vimeo attracts over 100 million unique visitors per month and more than 22 million registered users. Vimeo On Demand, which was launched in March 2013, is a digital distribution platform designed to help creators sell their films and video series.\nBitcoin is a decentralized payment system created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and introduced as open-source software in 2009. Payments are recorded in a public ledger using its own unit of account, which is called Bitcoin.\nNakamoto vanished into the night in early 2010 with over 1 million bitcoins that he had mined while maintaining the lions share of the network hashrate.\nFull Story:\nhttp://altcoinpress.com/2014/10/vimeo-works-to-integrate-bitcoin-payments-into-vod/\n", "views": 998, "author": "MicroGuy Legendary Online Activity: 1904 Merit: 1003 www.MicroGuy.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVimeo Works to Integrate Bitcoin Payments into VOD\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-10-11 01:21:20", "content": "Great News!\nit would be another big enterprise we could add to the Accepting Bitcoin list,which is growing day per day\n", "author": "ticoti Hero Member Offline Activity: 840 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-10-11 01:22:12", "content": "that is great news.\n", "author": "mbaeichapareiko Member Offline Activity: 100 Merit: 10 "}], "date": "2014-10-11 01:18:55"}, {"content": "Problems with btc:\n1. wild, unstable exchange rate\n2. difficulty to obtain and use (for most people)\n3. getting coins hacked or lost by sending to wrong address\n4. fraud/theft at exchanges (if it happened at Gox it could happen anywhere)\n5. it enables criminals to get paid online\n6. there are already plenty of ways to send money online a lot easier, it doesnt really do anything new\n7. absolutely no buyer protection\n8. scam companies/scammers\nfeel free to add to this list ^^\ngood things:\n1. cheap way to send money\n2. only 21 mil ever in circulation\nSo why should more people start using btc?  It seems the cons outweigh the pros.\n", "views": 1787, "author": "jcoin200 Hero Member Offline Activity: 504 Merit: 500 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDoes bitcoin solve more problems than it creates?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-10-08 12:56:19", "content": "Problems with btc:\n1. wild, unstable exchange rate\n2. difficulty to obtain and use (for most people)\n3. getting coins hacked or lost by sending to wrong address\n4. fraud/theft at exchanges (if it happened at Gox it could happen anywhere)\n5. it enables criminals to get paid online\n6. absolutely no buyer protection\ngood things:\n1. cheap way to send money\n2. only 21 mil ever in circulation\nSo why should more people start using btc?  It seems the cons outweigh the pros.\n1. no problem.

This is just a functional of the relatively small market cap and speculation in BTC; as the market matures this will be a self-solving problem. But it's a bit silly to complain about a \"problem\" that exists only because BTC has rocketed upward in value in the past 5-6 years. That's like complaining Apple stock has a problem because it's been so profitable.\n2. It's easy to sign up on coinbase and link your bank and/or credit card to it, to buy BTC. Trivial really, and no harder than signing up for a new user account on any given retail website. So I don't buy this one either.\n3. I don't see anything unique in this - in principle you can make equivalent errors with Fiat transactions.\n4. I agree this is a problem; customers of exchanges do need to keep voting with their funds, favoring exchanges that are the most transparent and aggressive in maintaining good security. Fiat exchanges in principle could be just as vulnerable to online theft, so I see the difference here as largely one of crypto exchanges being less well-funded and they've not been around long enough or have enough experienced employees to have a full security system in place.\n5. Criminals also move fiat around on-line. Granted, the pseudo-anonymity of crypto is attractive to criminals. But it is also attractive to legitimate dissidents to repressive governments, and free citizens worldwide who shouldn't have government/neighbors/anyone else snooping on them either.\n6. With logic like that we'd still be walking and refusing to ride horses, much less drive cars! Sure you can send fiat around with a 2.9% or $10 or more transfer fee, but BTC is MUCH more efficient. And much faster. These are clear wins for crypto that will ultimately force the issue -\npeople do not like wasting money\nand BTC/altcoin transfer efficiency will steadily defeat competition over the long haul for this reason.\n7. Buyer protection is only as good as the company offering it anyway; legitimate businesses will treat customers fairly if they want to avoid a death spiral of negative publicity. I think this is the one issue BTC supporters stress about more than they should. It's not a non-issue, but long-term business self-interest makes it much less of an issue than many people think.\n8. Granted there is an intense focus by criminals on bitcoin these days; most of us here for any length of time have shrapnel in us attesting to that fact, myself included. So I'm in agreement on this one, and think we as a community need to develop and publicize best practices for individuals and businesses to defeat the scammers. If we can block 90% of the scamming with a reasonable combination of security improvements at exchanges and so forth, and increased user awareness, and improvements in wallet software and so forth, we'll hopefully drive the scammers to go chase lower hanging fruit somewhere else or just give up.\n", "author": "ebliever Legendary Offline Activity: 1582 Merit: 1011 "}, {"date": "2014-10-08 20:20:20", "content": "Problems with btc:\n1. wild, unstable exchange rate\n2. difficulty to obtain and use (for most people)\n3. getting coins hacked or lost by sending to wrong address\n4. fraud/theft at exchanges (if it happened at Gox it could happen anywhere)\n5. it enables criminals to get paid online\n6. there are already plenty of ways to send money online a lot easier, it doesnt really do anything new\n7. absolutely no buyer protection\n8. scam companies/scammers\nfeel free to add to this list ^^\ngood things:\n1. cheap way to send money\n2. only 21 mil ever in circulation\nSo why should more people start using btc?

That quote can be summarized as follows:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly zero economists endorsed [returning to the gold standard] in a recent poll ... It &lt;strong&gt;prevents the central bank from fighting recessions&lt;/strong&gt; by outsourcing monetary policy decisions to how much gold we have ... When we peg the dollar to gold we have to raise interest rates when gold is scarce, regardless of the state of the economy. &lt;strong&gt;This policy inflexibility was the major cause of the Great Depression&lt;/strong&gt;, as governments were forced to tighten policy at the worst possible moment. &lt;strong&gt;It's no coincidence that the sooner a country abandoned the gold standard, the sooner it began recovering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\nPantera continues, explaining in their own words that &lt;em&gt;\"inflation (and deflation) was much worse under the gold standard than it has been since\"&lt;/em&gt;, and that a return to such would not lead to any form of price stability.\nSo far, in their argument for bitcoin, Pantera has explained that the root cause of &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.history.com/topics/great-depression\n\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; was due to the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/1999/march/monetary-policy-and-the-great-crash-of-1929-a-bursting-bubble-or-collapsing-fundamentals/\n\"&gt;monetary inflexibility&lt;/a&gt; (of course, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.freedomworks.org/content/debunking-myths-great-depression\n\"&gt;others disagree with that assessment&lt;/a&gt;) that was imposed on countries who operated under the gold standard, that the sooner a nation abandoned the gold standard in favor of fiat currency, the sooner they recovered from the Depression, and that both inflation and depression have been far more pronounced when monetary policy is dictated by the supply of a scarce resource. While factual, I'd expect a pro-bitcoin article to gloss over such details, not emphasize them.\n[caption id=\"attachment_794\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]&lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/annoyance.php\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-full wp-image-794\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bitcoins.jpg\n\" alt=\"Physical bitcoins by Casascius, because every article about bitcoin needs a picture of them.\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/annoyance.php\n\"&gt;Physical bitcoins by Casascius&lt;/a&gt;, because every article about bitcoin needs a picture of them.[/caption]\n&lt;strong&gt;But all that is just an aside, let me continue...&lt;/strong&gt;\nCiting the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.gold.org\n\"&gt;World Gold Council&lt;/a&gt;, Pantera shows that from 2010 through 2013, world-wide demand for gold amounted to 17,500 metric tons, of which 8,400 tons were used for jewelry, 5,900 tons were purchased for investment purposes, 1,600 tons in industry, 170 tons for dentistry and 1,500 tons were purchased by central banks (if you're using a calculator, I'll admit that the numbers won't total correctly, as I did some rounding).\n&lt;strong&gt;Jewelry is not an investment in gold...&lt;/strong&gt;\nPantera assumes gold jewelry to be an investment and argues that by moving their wealth from gold jewelry to bitcoin, and Indian family's (without access to banks, but presumably with access to the internet) wealth would be much safer.\n[caption id=\"attachment_795\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"512\"]&lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.fashionstrend.co.uk/gold-jewelry-sets-collection-for-indian-brides-2013/indian-jewellery-bridal-jewellery-collection-2013-1/\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-medium wp-image-795\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/india_jewelry-512x561.jpg\n\" alt=\"Gold jewelry shouldn't be viewed as an &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot; in gold, but rather, as &amp;quot;bling&amp;quot;.  Image Source: FashionsTrend.co.uk\" width=\"512\" height=\"561\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Gold jewelry shouldn't be viewed as an \"investment\" in gold, but rather, as \"bling\".Image Source: &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.fashionstrend.co.uk/gold-jewelry-sets-collection-for-indian-brides-2013/indian-jewellery-bridal-jewellery-collection-2013-1/\n\"&gt;FashionsTrend.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;\n[/caption]\nLets first point out that jewelry is one of the worst possible ways to \"invest\" in gold. Even &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qOPhm1H4-f8J:https://www.thegoldbug.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=105&amp;amp;Itemid=115\n\"&gt;thegoldbug.com&lt;/a&gt;, (the link goes to a cached version of the site on Google's servers, as the \"real\" site has been defaced by hackers), lists investing in gold in the form of jewelry as one of the top 10 mistakes, saying:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"&lt;strong&gt;Remember that Gold Jewelry is not an Investment&lt;/strong&gt;  As with nuggets, jewelry is an unreliable source of gold. Not only is the&lt;em&gt; purity of the metal once again a concern,&lt;/em&gt; but there is also &lt;em&gt;the added artisan's premium present in all jewelry&lt;/em&gt;. The cost applied by the craftsman who made the piece will &lt;em&gt;always inflate the price well past the value of the metal alone&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, while jewelry may have value in its own right, it has &lt;em&gt;no place in the hands of an investor&lt;/em&gt; who is looking to own gold as an asset. (&lt;em&gt;Emphasis' &lt;/em&gt;are my own)&lt;/p&gt;\nEssentially, gold jewelry is a means of displaying that one has wealth, but to use the jewelry a method to store that wealth itself is a terrible idea. Whether the national currency of India is Rupees or bitcoin, Indians who want to display that they hold significant wealth will contiune to buy gold jewelry. Gold is \"blng\", and bitcoin, existing only in the form of electrons, has no \"bling\" factor. Arguing otherwise is essentially trying to argue that as a result of an ec51%onomy moving to bitcoin, that demand for &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/index\n\"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;' or &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.rolex.com\n\"&gt;Rolex&lt;/a&gt; watches will dry up. Right there, 48% of the gold demand which Pantera presumes that bitcoin could replace evaporates.\n&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoins' \"advantages\" over gold. Are they really \"advantages\"?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFurther along, when Pantera tries to explain the traits that bitcoin has but gold lacks, explaining that for gold miners to deliever the same service as bitcoin miners, they would have to provide armed guards, concealed tranaction values and a constantly updated ledger of transactions. None of these arguments make sense:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;armed guards (why? miners don't guarantee the security of the wallet file on your computer),&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;concealed transaction values (inexplicable; if I hand a gold coin to you, is that transaction not concealed from the rest of the world?), and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a constantly updated ledger (for what? an up to date ledger is essential for a digital currency, yes, but for a physical currency, a ledger is of no added value - why do i need a transaction recorded in a ledger when I have my gold in hand?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\nFurthermore, in explaining bitcoins' advantages over gold, they state that bitcoin is superior to gold due to the difficulty of theft. Dig through enought bitcoin-related discussions on &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/\n\"&gt;Reddit's bitcoin-related threads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org\n\"&gt;bitcointalk's forums&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see that whether its because of a keylogger on one's computer, an exchange not using &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication\n\"&gt;2-Factor Authentication&lt;/a&gt;, a user choosing an insecure method of generating a wallet (say, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ptuf3/brain_wallet_disaster/\n\"&gt;brainwallet&lt;/a&gt;, for example), or an &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.mtgox.com/\n\"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; declaring that all of their customers holdings are gone due to a \"bug\" in the bitcoin protocol, bitcoins can be stolen just as any other asset can be.\n&lt;strong&gt;Would nations really rely on the blockchain to store their wealth?&lt;/strong&gt;\nThey also describe the network of bitcoin miners as being a robust form of security. While presently true that achieving enough computing power to conduct a 51% attack is beyond most people means, if a nation adopted bitcoin as their currency, I could easily envision a scenario where a rival, or a group of rivals, could be motivated to discretely and covertly develop and deploy their own network of ASIC miners in order to conduct &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://econwarfare.org\n\"&gt;economic warfare&lt;/a&gt; against that  state. And unlike the \"limited\" means that most of us have that places a 51% attack out of reach, once nation-states are in the game, there is no telling how many of their resources they would devote to such an effort. Just because such an event has not yet happened &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.johnperkins.org\n\"&gt;does not mean that it won't&lt;/a&gt;, ESPECIALLY if bitcoin became the official currency of a country.\n[caption id=\"attachment_796\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"336\"]&lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0452287081&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=dioxidizedcom-20&amp;amp;linkId=2VLRWLSNPRSMT4N3\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-full wp-image-796\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/confessionshitman.jpg\n\" alt=\"Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.\" width=\"336\" height=\"506\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.[/caption]\n&lt;strong&gt;Supply Limits&lt;/strong&gt;\nAnother \"advantage\" they cite is bitcoin's strictly limited supply, compared to the continued mining of gold. I struggle to see the relevance - 165,000 metric tons of gold &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.numbersleuth.org/worlds-gold/\n\"&gt;has already been mined&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.usgs.gov\n\"&gt;US Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; that Pantera cites says that there are an esimated 52,000 metric tons of gold still remaining underground. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining continues along, creating 3600 new coins per day, and though reward halvings will continue to occur roughly every four years, the full supply of bitcoin won't have been mined until the year 2140.\nAside from that, recall earlier in their report when Pantera pointed out how the flexibility of fiat currencies was \"superior\" to the inflexibility imposed by using an asset of limited supply as a means of conducting trade. Now, it is a supposed advantage? They need to take one side of the argument or the other, not both.\n&lt;strong&gt;So where does that leave us?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFor starters, bitcoin is incapable of replacing gold in dentistry and industrial applications, two sources that contibute $66,114 to the $4.2 million final estimated value that bitcoin could achieve. Neither would bitcoin replace jewelry, as jewelry is means of displaying value, not storing it. There goes another $286,496 of their estimate. While it could and likely will be used as a means of investment, indeed, it already is, it's foolish to think that the bitcoin would replace 100% of the gold presently held either in investment portfolios or in safes. Yes, it is another instrument that people can use to invest their wealth in, but it won't erase nearly 10,000 years of human history and cause demand for holding gold as an investment to zero. Another $88,153 off of the value\n&lt;strong&gt;And the biggest item on their list, world M2 (money supply)&lt;/strong&gt;\nFirst off, to bear down on the same point yet again, circle back to Pantera's original &lt;a href=\"#Atlantic\"&gt;quote from the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; regarding the effects of a nation sticking with the gold standard versus fiat currencies, as a bitcoin denominated economy would operate in a manner far closer to one operating under the gold standard than one with fiat currency.\nSecondly, from what I just pointed out above, I have difficulty imaging any nation wanting to switch to bitcoin as their nominal currency, knowing that another nation could concievably overtake and subvert the entire network. The two biggest threats in that scenario would be the United States and China, both of whom have a deep supply of people with the necessary skillsets to design the needed hardware and the domestic production capacity to create the needed hardware without drawing any outside attention until it is too late.\n&lt;strong&gt;And where does that leave bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;\nDespite my arguments above, I believe that bitcoin is still an asset that could possess significant value; as a peer-to-peer currency, it allows individuals to send money to one another quicker than sending checks through the mail and more inexpensively that wire transfers or worse, money transfer services.\nIt can certainly be adopted by companies as a means of receiving payments to cut down on credit card processing fees. The challenge there is convincing the customer to opt to pay using bitcoin and abandon the incentives offered by credit card companies to \"charge\" their purchases. Bitcoin doesn't have reward points, for instance, and more critically, consumers lose the ability to charge back a purchase if necessary (for instance, if a company refuses to adhere to its refund policy), or, to take an example from the bitcoin community - if &lt;a style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\" href=\"\nhttp://www.butterflylabs.com\n\"&gt;Butterfl&lt;/a&gt;... I mean, a company,  takes orders for a product and doesn't ship those orders until a year had passed.\nThe lack of ability to reverse a bitcoin transaction is frequently cited as reason why biusinesses should adopt bitcoin, but there are also plenty of legitimate reasons why consumers prefer to have that ability besides try to defraud merchants.\nOne place where the lack of chargebacks shouldn't be a concern to consumers are for products/services that can't really be returned anyways. Dining. Haircuts. Digital purchases such as software or musc (an area where &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.paypal.com\n\"&gt;Paypal's&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/goodbye-passwords-one-touch-hello-bitcoin\n\"&gt;Braintree&lt;/a&gt; has already entered the market).\nBut for goods, especially from vendors whose ability or willingness to deliver those goods in a &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1w2hdk/horrors_of_butterfly_labs/\n\"&gt;timely manner might be in question&lt;/a&gt;, most consumers will likely want a payment method that allows them to dispute the charge and recoup their money if the vendor doesn't honor their obligations.\n&lt;strong&gt;That brings us to the next place where bitcoin can really shine - the remittance marketplace. &lt;/strong&gt;\nI fully expect bitcoin to either overtake or be adopted by &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/2014/09/18/remittance-a-place-where-bitcoin-can-shine-today/\n\"&gt;the remittance market&lt;/a&gt;. For it to trully dominate, though, my personal thought is that bitcoins involvement in remittanes will need to be made transparent to the end-users; a remitter would simply walk into a store and hand their money to the cashier and provide instuctions as to where to send the funds. The transfer company would then buy bitcoins and send those coins to the branch were the receiver will be picking up their funds, who would then immediately sell those coins and deliver the proceeds in the recipients currency of choice.\n[caption id=\"attachment_793\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]&lt;img class=\"wp-image-793 size-full\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fannie-mae_stock.png\n\" alt=\"fannie-mae_stock\" width=\"500\" height=\"434\" /&gt; The dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket, whether that basket is bitcoins, litecoins, or the shares of any single company is irrelevant.[/caption]\nLastly, bitcoin can absolutely serve as a means to store wealth, but in my view, only it's only appropriate to use it as \"store of value\" as part of a diviersified investment portfolio. Asset prices flucuate - storing all of ones wealth in bitcoin should be just as frowned upon as storing all of ones wealth in shares of a single company, say, Fannie Mae, for example.\nTo conclude, while I think that bitcoin certainly has value in the future, I think that the maximum value of a single bitcoin well below the $4,291,060 estimate published by Pantera, and disagree with many of the reasons that Pantera cites that bitcoin could or should replace gold rather than being viewed as an asset to own in addition to gold (and real estate, and equities, and bonds, etc).\n", "views": 2786, "author": "lucasjkr Hero Member Offline Activity: 644 Merit: 500 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy I think Pantera Capital is wrong in their $4.2 million/BTC estimate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-10-08 21:54:06", "content": "Personally i think they are right\nBitcoin will be worth over 1 milion $\n", "author": "Velkro Legendary Offline Activity: 1554 Merit: 1001 &lt;3 Vanity Addresses :) "}, {"date": "2014-10-08 22:02:58", "content": "Personally i think they are right\nBitcoin will be worth over 1 milion $\nThat's not realistic, but I would very much welcome it because then I don't have to work anymore.\nI think the max price it will ever reach, if ever, is $10,000 and that's a fair estimate.\n", "author": "1Referee Legendary Online Activity: 1638 Merit: 1192 "}, {"date": "2014-10-08 22:06:02", "content": "One of the best ways to assure destruction of free trade in the world, is to make Bitcoin the leading form of money in the world.\nIf the electrical grid and the Internet crashed today, fiat would survive.

That quote can be summarized as follows:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly zero economists endorsed [returning to the gold standard] in a recent poll ... It &lt;strong&gt;prevents the central bank from fighting recessions&lt;/strong&gt; by outsourcing monetary policy decisions to how much gold we have ... When we peg the dollar to gold we have to raise interest rates when gold is scarce, regardless of the state of the economy. &lt;strong&gt;This policy inflexibility was the major cause of the Great Depression&lt;/strong&gt;, as governments were forced to tighten policy at the worst possible moment. &lt;strong&gt;It's no coincidence that the sooner a country abandoned the gold standard, the sooner it began recovering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\nPantera continues, explaining in their own words that &lt;em&gt;\"inflation (and deflation) was much worse under the gold standard than it has been since\"&lt;/em&gt;, and that a return to such would not lead to any form of price stability.\nSo far, in their argument for bitcoin, Pantera has explained that the root cause of &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.history.com/topics/great-depression\n\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; was due to the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/1999/march/monetary-policy-and-the-great-crash-of-1929-a-bursting-bubble-or-collapsing-fundamentals/\n\"&gt;monetary inflexibility&lt;/a&gt; (of course, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.freedomworks.org/content/debunking-myths-great-depression\n\"&gt;others disagree with that assessment&lt;/a&gt;) that was imposed on countries who operated under the gold standard, that the sooner a nation abandoned the gold standard in favor of fiat currency, the sooner they recovered from the Depression, and that both inflation and depression have been far more pronounced when monetary policy is dictated by the supply of a scarce resource.

Even &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qOPhm1H4-f8J:https://www.thegoldbug.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=105&amp;amp;Itemid=115\n\"&gt;thegoldbug.com&lt;/a&gt;, (the link goes to a cached version of the site on Google's servers, as the \"real\" site has been defaced by hackers), lists investing in gold in the form of jewelry as one of the top 10 mistakes, saying:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"&lt;strong&gt;Remember that Gold Jewelry is not an Investment&lt;/strong&gt;  As with nuggets, jewelry is an unreliable source of gold. Not only is the&lt;em&gt; purity of the metal once again a concern,&lt;/em&gt; but there is also &lt;em&gt;the added artisan's premium present in all jewelry&lt;/em&gt;. The cost applied by the craftsman who made the piece will &lt;em&gt;always inflate the price well past the value of the metal alone&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, while jewelry may have value in its own right, it has &lt;em&gt;no place in the hands of an investor&lt;/em&gt; who is looking to own gold as an asset. (&lt;em&gt;Emphasis' &lt;/em&gt;are my own)&lt;/p&gt;\nEssentially, gold jewelry is a means of displaying that one has wealth, but to use the jewelry a method to store that wealth itself is a terrible idea. Whether the national currency of India is Rupees or bitcoin, Indians who want to display that they hold significant wealth will contiune to buy gold jewelry. Gold is \"blng\", and bitcoin, existing only in the form of electrons, has no \"bling\" factor. Arguing otherwise is essentially trying to argue that as a result of an ec51%onomy moving to bitcoin, that demand for &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/index\n\"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;' or &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.rolex.com\n\"&gt;Rolex&lt;/a&gt; watches will dry up. Right there, 48% of the gold demand which Pantera presumes that bitcoin could replace evaporates.\n&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoins' \"advantages\" over gold. Are they really \"advantages\"?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFurther along, when Pantera tries to explain the traits that bitcoin has but gold lacks, explaining that for gold miners to deliever the same service as bitcoin miners, they would have to provide armed guards, concealed tranaction values and a constantly updated ledger of transactions. None of these arguments make sense:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;armed guards (why? miners don't guarantee the security of the wallet file on your computer),&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;concealed transaction values (inexplicable; if I hand a gold coin to you, is that transaction not concealed from the rest of the world?), and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a constantly updated ledger (for what? an up to date ledger is essential for a digital currency, yes, but for a physical currency, a ledger is of no added value - why do i need a transaction recorded in a ledger when I have my gold in hand?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\nFurthermore, in explaining bitcoins' advantages over gold, they state that bitcoin is superior to gold due to the difficulty of theft. Dig through enought bitcoin-related discussions on &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/\n\"&gt;Reddit's bitcoin-related threads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org\n\"&gt;bitcointalk's forums&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see that whether its because of a keylogger on one's computer, an exchange not using &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication\n\"&gt;2-Factor Authentication&lt;/a&gt;, a user choosing an insecure method of generating a wallet (say, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ptuf3/brain_wallet_disaster/\n\"&gt;brainwallet&lt;/a&gt;, for example), or an &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.mtgox.com/\n\"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; declaring that all of their customers holdings are gone due to a \"bug\" in the bitcoin protocol, bitcoins can be stolen just as any other asset can be.\n&lt;strong&gt;Would nations really rely on the blockchain to store their wealth?&lt;/strong&gt;\nThey also describe the network of bitcoin miners as being a robust form of security. While presently true that achieving enough computing power to conduct a 51% attack is beyond most people means, if a nation adopted bitcoin as their currency, I could easily envision a scenario where a rival, or a group of rivals, could be motivated to discretely and covertly develop and deploy their own network of ASIC miners in order to conduct &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://econwarfare.org\n\"&gt;economic warfare&lt;/a&gt; against that  state. And unlike the \"limited\" means that most of us have that places a 51% attack out of reach, once nation-states are in the game, there is no telling how many of their resources they would devote to such an effort. Just because such an event has not yet happened &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.johnperkins.org\n\"&gt;does not mean that it won't&lt;/a&gt;, ESPECIALLY if bitcoin became the official currency of a country.\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_796\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"336\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0452287081&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=dioxidizedcom-20&amp;amp;linkId=2VLRWLSNPRSMT4N3\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-full wp-image-796\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/confessionshitman.jpg\n\" alt=\"Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.\" width=\"336\" height=\"506\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Supply Limits&lt;/strong&gt;\nAnother \"advantage\" they cite is bitcoin's strictly limited supply, compared to the continued mining of gold. I struggle to see the relevance - 165,000 metric tons of gold &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.numbersleuth.org/worlds-gold/\n\"&gt;has already been mined&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.usgs.gov\n\"&gt;US Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; that Pantera cites says that there are an esimated 52,000 metric tons of gold still remaining underground. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining continues along, creating 3600 new coins per day, and though reward halvings will continue to occur roughly every four years, the full supply of bitcoin won't have been mined until the year 2140.\nAside from that, recall earlier in their report when Pantera pointed out how the flexibility of fiat currencies was \"superior\" to the inflexibility imposed by using an asset of limited supply as a means of conducting trade. Now, it is a supposed advantage? They need to take one side of the argument or the other, not both.\n&lt;strong&gt;So where does that leave us?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFor starters, bitcoin is incapable of replacing gold in dentistry and industrial applications, two sources that contibute $66,114 to the $4.2 million final estimated value that bitcoin could achieve. Neither would bitcoin replace jewelry, as jewelry is means of displaying value, not storing it. There goes another $286,496 of their estimate. While it could and likely will be used as a means of investment, indeed, it already is, it's foolish to think that the bitcoin would replace 100% of the gold presently held either in investment portfolios or in safes. Yes, it is another instrument that people can use to invest their wealth in, but it won't erase nearly 10,000 years of human history and cause demand for holding gold as an investment to zero. Another $88,153 off of the value\n&lt;strong&gt;And the biggest item on their list, world M2 (money supply)&lt;/strong&gt;\nFirst off, to bear down on the same point yet again, circle back to Pantera's original &lt;a href=\"#Atlantic\"&gt;quote from the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; regarding the effects of a nation sticking with the gold standard versus fiat currencies, as a bitcoin denominated economy would operate in a manner far closer to one operating under the gold standard than one with fiat currency.\nSecondly, from what I just pointed out above, I have difficulty imaging any nation wanting to switch to bitcoin as their nominal currency, knowing that another nation could concievably overtake and subvert the entire network. The two biggest threats in that scenario would be the United States and China, both of whom have a deep supply of people with the necessary skillsets to design the needed hardware and the domestic production capacity to create the needed hardware without drawing any outside attention until it is too late.\n&lt;strong&gt;And where does that leave bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;\nDespite my arguments above, I believe that bitcoin is still an asset that could possess significant value; as a peer-to-peer currency, it allows individuals to send money to one another quicker than sending checks through the mail and more inexpensively that wire transfers or worse, money transfer services.\nIt can certainly be adopted by companies as a means of receiving payments to cut down on credit card processing fees. The challenge there is convincing the customer to opt to pay using bitcoin and abandon the incentives offered by credit card companies to \"charge\" their purchases. Bitcoin doesn't have reward points, for instance, and more critically, consumers lose the ability to charge back a purchase if necessary (for instance, if a company refuses to adhere to its refund policy), or, to take an example from the bitcoin community - if &lt;a style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\" href=\"\nhttp://www.butterflylabs.com\n\"&gt;Butterfl&lt;/a&gt;... I mean, a company,  takes orders for a product and doesn't ship those orders until a year had passed.\nThe lack of ability to reverse a bitcoin transaction is frequently cited as reason why biusinesses should adopt bitcoin, but there are also plenty of legitimate reasons why consumers prefer to have that ability besides try to defraud merchants.\nOne place where the lack of chargebacks shouldn't be a concern to consumers are for products/services that can't really be returned anyways. Dining. Haircuts. Digital purchases such as software or musc (an area where &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.paypal.com\n\"&gt;Paypal's&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/goodbye-passwords-one-touch-hello-bitcoin\n\"&gt;Braintree&lt;/a&gt; has already entered the market).\nBut for goods, especially from vendors whose ability or willingness to deliver those goods in a &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1w2hdk/horrors_of_butterfly_labs/\n\"&gt;timely manner might be in question&lt;/a&gt;, most consumers will likely want a payment method that allows them to dispute the charge and recoup their money if the vendor doesn't honor their obligations.\n&lt;strong&gt;That brings us to the next place where bitcoin can really shine - the remittance marketplace. &lt;/strong&gt;\nI fully expect bitcoin to either overtake or be adopted by &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/2014/09/18/remittance-a-place-where-bitcoin-can-shine-today/\n\"&gt;the remittance market&lt;/a&gt;. For it to trully dominate, though, my personal thought is that bitcoins involvement in remittanes will need to be made transparent to the end-users; a remitter would simply walk into a store and hand their money to the cashier and provide instuctions as to where to send the funds. The transfer company would then buy bitcoins and send those coins to the branch were the receiver will be picking up their funds, who would then immediately sell those coins and deliver the proceeds in the recipients currency of choice.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_793\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img class=\"wp-image-793 size-full\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fannie-mae_stock.png\n\" alt=\"fannie-mae_stock\" width=\"500\" height=\"434\" /&gt; The dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket, whether that basket is bitcoins, litecoins, or the shares of any single company is irrelevant.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Lastly, bitcoin can absolutely serve as a means to store wealth, but in my view, only it's only appropriate to use it as \"store of value\" as part of a diviersified investment portfolio. Asset prices flucuate - storing all of ones wealth in bitcoin should be just as frowned upon as storing all of ones wealth in shares of a single company, say, Fannie Mae, for example.\nTo conclude, while I think that bitcoin certainly has value in the future, I think that the maximum value of a single bitcoin well below the $4,291,060 estimate published by Pantera, and disagree with many of the reasons that Pantera cites that bitcoin could or should replace gold rather than being viewed as an asset to own in addition to gold (and real estate, and equities, and bonds, etc).\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n", "author": "BADecker Legendary Online Activity: 1792 Merit: 1046 "}, {"date": "2014-10-08 23:08:35", "content": "@BADecker:\nIt's why i posted a link to the original story, rather than attempting to reformat it using simple machines forums' syntax.

The Power Elite are more prepared than anyone else, and if their fiats flopped, and Bitcoin takes over, they would crash the world, simply to remain in control.\nLet Bitcoin grow.

That quote can be summarized as follows:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly zero economists endorsed [returning to the gold standard] in a recent poll ... It &lt;strong&gt;prevents the central bank from fighting recessions&lt;/strong&gt; by outsourcing monetary policy decisions to how much gold we have ... When we peg the dollar to gold we have to raise interest rates when gold is scarce, regardless of the state of the economy. &lt;strong&gt;This policy inflexibility was the major cause of the Great Depression&lt;/strong&gt;, as governments were forced to tighten policy at the worst possible moment. &lt;strong&gt;It's no coincidence that the sooner a country abandoned the gold standard, the sooner it began recovering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\nPantera continues, explaining in their own words that &lt;em&gt;\"inflation (and deflation) was much worse under the gold standard than it has been since\"&lt;/em&gt;, and that a return to such would not lead to any form of price stability.\nSo far, in their argument for bitcoin, Pantera has explained that the root cause of &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.history.com/topics/great-depression\n\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; was due to the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/1999/march/monetary-policy-and-the-great-crash-of-1929-a-bursting-bubble-or-collapsing-fundamentals/\n\"&gt;monetary inflexibility&lt;/a&gt; (of course, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.freedomworks.org/content/debunking-myths-great-depression\n\"&gt;others disagree with that assessment&lt;/a&gt;) that was imposed on countries who operated under the gold standard, that the sooner a nation abandoned the gold standard in favor of fiat currency, the sooner they recovered from the Depression, and that both inflation and depression have been far more pronounced when monetary policy is dictated by the supply of a scarce resource. While factual, I'd expect a pro-bitcoin article to gloss over such details, not emphasize them.\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_794\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/annoyance.php\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-full wp-image-794\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bitcoins.jpg\n\" alt=\"Physical bitcoins by Casascius, because every article about bitcoin needs a picture of them.\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/annoyance.php\n\"&gt;Physical bitcoins by Casascius&lt;/a&gt;, because every article about bitcoin needs a picture of them.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;But all that is just an aside, let me continue...&lt;/strong&gt;\nCiting the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.gold.org\n\"&gt;World Gold Council&lt;/a&gt;, Pantera shows that from 2010 through 2013, world-wide demand for gold amounted to 17,500 metric tons, of which 8,400 tons were used for jewelry, 5,900 tons were purchased for investment purposes, 1,600 tons in industry, 170 tons for dentistry and 1,500 tons were purchased by central banks (if you're using a calculator, I'll admit that the numbers won't total correctly, as I did some rounding).\n&lt;strong&gt;Jewelry is not an investment in gold...&lt;/strong&gt;\nPantera assumes gold jewelry to be an investment and argues that by moving their wealth from gold jewelry to bitcoin, and Indian family's (without access to banks, but presumably with access to the internet) wealth would be much safer.\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_795\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"512\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.fashionstrend.co.uk/gold-jewelry-sets-collection-for-indian-brides-2013/indian-jewellery-bridal-jewellery-collection-2013-1/\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-medium wp-image-795\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/india_jewelry-512x561.jpg\n\" alt=\"Gold jewelry shouldn't be viewed as an &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot; in gold, but rather, as &amp;quot;bling&amp;quot;.  Image Source: FashionsTrend.co.uk\" width=\"512\" height=\"561\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Gold jewelry shouldn't be viewed as an \"investment\" in gold, but rather, as \"bling\".Image Source: &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.fashionstrend.co.uk/gold-jewelry-sets-collection-for-indian-brides-2013/indian-jewellery-bridal-jewellery-collection-2013-1/\n\"&gt;FashionsTrend.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;Lets first point out that jewelry is one of the worst possible ways to \"invest\" in gold. Even &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qOPhm1H4-f8J:https://www.thegoldbug.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=105&amp;amp;Itemid=115\n\"&gt;thegoldbug.com&lt;/a&gt;, (the link goes to a cached version of the site on Google's servers, as the \"real\" site has been defaced by hackers), lists investing in gold in the form of jewelry as one of the top 10 mistakes, saying:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"&lt;strong&gt;Remember that Gold Jewelry is not an Investment&lt;/strong&gt;  As with nuggets, jewelry is an unreliable source of gold. Not only is the&lt;em&gt; purity of the metal once again a concern,&lt;/em&gt; but there is also &lt;em&gt;the added artisan's premium present in all jewelry&lt;/em&gt;. The cost applied by the craftsman who made the piece will &lt;em&gt;always inflate the price well past the value of the metal alone&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, while jewelry may have value in its own right, it has &lt;em&gt;no place in the hands of an investor&lt;/em&gt; who is looking to own gold as an asset. (&lt;em&gt;Emphasis' &lt;/em&gt;are my own)&lt;/p&gt;\nEssentially, gold jewelry is a means of displaying that one has wealth, but to use the jewelry a method to store that wealth itself is a terrible idea. Whether the national currency of India is Rupees or bitcoin, Indians who want to display that they hold significant wealth will contiune to buy gold jewelry. Gold is \"blng\", and bitcoin, existing only in the form of electrons, has no \"bling\" factor. Arguing otherwise is essentially trying to argue that as a result of an ec51%onomy moving to bitcoin, that demand for &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/index\n\"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;' or &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.rolex.com\n\"&gt;Rolex&lt;/a&gt; watches will dry up. Right there, 48% of the gold demand which Pantera presumes that bitcoin could replace evaporates.\n&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoins' \"advantages\" over gold. Are they really \"advantages\"?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFurther along, when Pantera tries to explain the traits that bitcoin has but gold lacks, explaining that for gold miners to deliever the same service as bitcoin miners, they would have to provide armed guards, concealed tranaction values and a constantly updated ledger of transactions. None of these arguments make sense:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;armed guards (why? miners don't guarantee the security of the wallet file on your computer),&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;concealed transaction values (inexplicable; if I hand a gold coin to you, is that transaction not concealed from the rest of the world?), and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a constantly updated ledger (for what? an up to date ledger is essential for a digital currency, yes, but for a physical currency, a ledger is of no added value - why do i need a transaction recorded in a ledger when I have my gold in hand?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\nFurthermore, in explaining bitcoins' advantages over gold, they state that bitcoin is superior to gold due to the difficulty of theft. Dig through enought bitcoin-related discussions on &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/\n\"&gt;Reddit's bitcoin-related threads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org\n\"&gt;bitcointalk's forums&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see that whether its because of a keylogger on one's computer, an exchange not using &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication\n\"&gt;2-Factor Authentication&lt;/a&gt;, a user choosing an insecure method of generating a wallet (say, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ptuf3/brain_wallet_disaster/\n\"&gt;brainwallet&lt;/a&gt;, for example), or an &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.mtgox.com/\n\"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; declaring that all of their customers holdings are gone due to a \"bug\" in the bitcoin protocol, bitcoins can be stolen just as any other asset can be.\n&lt;strong&gt;Would nations really rely on the blockchain to store their wealth?&lt;/strong&gt;\nThey also describe the network of bitcoin miners as being a robust form of security. While presently true that achieving enough computing power to conduct a 51% attack is beyond most people means, if a nation adopted bitcoin as their currency, I could easily envision a scenario where a rival, or a group of rivals, could be motivated to discretely and covertly develop and deploy their own network of ASIC miners in order to conduct &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://econwarfare.org\n\"&gt;economic warfare&lt;/a&gt; against that  state. And unlike the \"limited\" means that most of us have that places a 51% attack out of reach, once nation-states are in the game, there is no telling how many of their resources they would devote to such an effort. Just because such an event has not yet happened &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.johnperkins.org\n\"&gt;does not mean that it won't&lt;/a&gt;, ESPECIALLY if bitcoin became the official currency of a country.\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_796\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"336\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0452287081&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=dioxidizedcom-20&amp;amp;linkId=2VLRWLSNPRSMT4N3\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-full wp-image-796\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/confessionshitman.jpg\n\" alt=\"Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.\" width=\"336\" height=\"506\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Supply Limits&lt;/strong&gt;\nAnother \"advantage\" they cite is bitcoin's strictly limited supply, compared to the continued mining of gold. I struggle to see the relevance - 165,000 metric tons of gold &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.numbersleuth.org/worlds-gold/\n\"&gt;has already been mined&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.usgs.gov\n\"&gt;US Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; that Pantera cites says that there are an esimated 52,000 metric tons of gold still remaining underground. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining continues along, creating 3600 new coins per day, and though reward halvings will continue to occur roughly every four years, the full supply of bitcoin won't have been mined until the year 2140.\nAside from that, recall earlier in their report when Pantera pointed out how the flexibility of fiat currencies was \"superior\" to the inflexibility imposed by using an asset of limited supply as a means of conducting trade. Now, it is a supposed advantage? They need to take one side of the argument or the other, not both.\n&lt;strong&gt;So where does that leave us?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFor starters, bitcoin is incapable of replacing gold in dentistry and industrial applications, two sources that contibute $66,114 to the $4.2 million final estimated value that bitcoin could achieve. Neither would bitcoin replace jewelry, as jewelry is means of displaying value, not storing it. There goes another $286,496 of their estimate. While it could and likely will be used as a means of investment, indeed, it already is, it's foolish to think that the bitcoin would replace 100% of the gold presently held either in investment portfolios or in safes. Yes, it is another instrument that people can use to invest their wealth in, but it won't erase nearly 10,000 years of human history and cause demand for holding gold as an investment to zero. Another $88,153 off of the value\n&lt;strong&gt;And the biggest item on their list, world M2 (money supply)&lt;/strong&gt;\nFirst off, to bear down on the same point yet again, circle back to Pantera's original &lt;a href=\"#Atlantic\"&gt;quote from the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; regarding the effects of a nation sticking with the gold standard versus fiat currencies, as a bitcoin denominated economy would operate in a manner far closer to one operating under the gold standard than one with fiat currency.\nSecondly, from what I just pointed out above, I have difficulty imaging any nation wanting to switch to bitcoin as their nominal currency, knowing that another nation could concievably overtake and subvert the entire network. The two biggest threats in that scenario would be the United States and China, both of whom have a deep supply of people with the necessary skillsets to design the needed hardware and the domestic production capacity to create the needed hardware without drawing any outside attention until it is too late.\n&lt;strong&gt;And where does that leave bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;\nDespite my arguments above, I believe that bitcoin is still an asset that could possess significant value; as a peer-to-peer currency, it allows individuals to send money to one another quicker than sending checks through the mail and more inexpensively that wire transfers or worse, money transfer services.\nIt can certainly be adopted by companies as a means of receiving payments to cut down on credit card processing fees. The challenge there is convincing the customer to opt to pay using bitcoin and abandon the incentives offered by credit card companies to \"charge\" their purchases. Bitcoin doesn't have reward points, for instance, and more critically, consumers lose the ability to charge back a purchase if necessary (for instance, if a company refuses to adhere to its refund policy), or, to take an example from the bitcoin community - if &lt;a style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\" href=\"\nhttp://www.butterflylabs.com\n\"&gt;Butterfl&lt;/a&gt;... I mean, a company,  takes orders for a product and doesn't ship those orders until a year had passed.\nThe lack of ability to reverse a bitcoin transaction is frequently cited as reason why biusinesses should adopt bitcoin, but there are also plenty of legitimate reasons why consumers prefer to have that ability besides try to defraud merchants.\nOne place where the lack of chargebacks shouldn't be a concern to consumers are for products/services that can't really be returned anyways. Dining. Haircuts. Digital purchases such as software or musc (an area where &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.paypal.com\n\"&gt;Paypal's&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/goodbye-passwords-one-touch-hello-bitcoin\n\"&gt;Braintree&lt;/a&gt; has already entered the market).\nBut for goods, especially from vendors whose ability or willingness to deliver those goods in a &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1w2hdk/horrors_of_butterfly_labs/\n\"&gt;timely manner might be in question&lt;/a&gt;, most consumers will likely want a payment method that allows them to dispute the charge and recoup their money if the vendor doesn't honor their obligations.\n&lt;strong&gt;That brings us to the next place where bitcoin can really shine - the remittance marketplace. &lt;/strong&gt;\nI fully expect bitcoin to either overtake or be adopted by &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/2014/09/18/remittance-a-place-where-bitcoin-can-shine-today/\n\"&gt;the remittance market&lt;/a&gt;. For it to trully dominate, though, my personal thought is that bitcoins involvement in remittanes will need to be made transparent to the end-users; a remitter would simply walk into a store and hand their money to the cashier and provide instuctions as to where to send the funds. The transfer company would then buy bitcoins and send those coins to the branch were the receiver will be picking up their funds, who would then immediately sell those coins and deliver the proceeds in the recipients currency of choice.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_793\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img class=\"wp-image-793 size-full\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fannie-mae_stock.png\n\" alt=\"fannie-mae_stock\" width=\"500\" height=\"434\" /&gt; The dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket, whether that basket is bitcoins, litecoins, or the shares of any single company is irrelevant.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Lastly, bitcoin can absolutely serve as a means to store wealth, but in my view, only it's only appropriate to use it as \"store of value\" as part of a diviersified investment portfolio. Asset prices flucuate - storing all of ones wealth in bitcoin should be just as frowned upon as storing all of ones wealth in shares of a single company, say, Fannie Mae, for example.\nTo conclude, while I think that bitcoin certainly has value in the future, I think that the maximum value of a single bitcoin well below the $4,291,060 estimate published by Pantera, and disagree with many of the reasons that Pantera cites that bitcoin could or should replace gold rather than being viewed as an asset to own in addition to gold (and real estate, and equities, and bonds, etc).\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nOr...... maybe just write it normal like 99.9% of other OPs.  Kind of hard to copy and paste on my phone.\n", "author": "jabo38 Legendary Offline Activity: 1162 Merit: 1000 mining is so 2012-2013 "}, {"date": "2014-10-10 05:02:17", "content": "If the electrical grid and the Internet crashed today, fiat would survive.

The Power Elite are more prepared than anyone else, and if their fiats flopped, and Bitcoin takes over, they would crash the world, simply to remain in control.\nLet Bitcoin grow. But don't let it become BIG... at least not in its current state. If Bitcoin could be held in hand, and could be traded among the people without electronics - computer and Internet - yet retained all the encryption that it currently has, along with the ability to easily be encrypted thousands of times stronger than it currently is, then and only then might it be a candidate for world currency.\nIn the event that technology crashed in a big way, we would be back to gold and silver, and copper.

Post your thoughts here.\nObjective\nSet up a Credit Union where Bitcoin users can set up direct deposit at work directly to a Bitcoin address. This will be the main function of the Credit Union initially with the ability to expand into other services down the road.\nApproach\nCredit Unions are not as difficult to get running as one might think. The main initial steps are setting up a business plan and getting signatures from those that might be willing to join. The goal will be to get 3,000 people to support the concept while less is still ok but makes things more difficult. 500 people will be the minimum. Focusing on a simple initial setup of direct deposit will allow us to apply for an Express Charter and will make it more likely that the Credit Union will be approved.\nWhat we need to begin\nThere are 10 main steps to setting up a Credit Union:\n1. Find something in common (Bitcoin users)\n2. Get together. A \"yes\" vote by 500 members while 3000 will help the process.\n3. Do the paperwork. There will be plenty of forms to be filled out and submitted.\n4. Meet the membership requirement. We will need to get signatures and a survey from the potential members.\n5. Find a financial expert. We need a CPA or someone good with accounting for the organizing committee.\n6. Form a committee. A small amount of people to help organize with good financial history.\n7. Set up a board of directors. We will vote on who we want for the initial board of directors.\n8. Collect money. To help with the initial funding we will need funds to get the ball rolling whether through donations or initial membership fee.\n9. Charter assistance. It would be useful to have the assistance of someone who has already set up a Credit Union to help review our submission.\n10. Apply for status. Petition the National Credit Union Administration for official status.\nInitial business plan\nThe goal is to make direct deposit to a Bitcoin address as simple as possible. A Bitcoin user will join the Bitcoin Credit Union with the same process as joining a bank or credit union. They will provide a deposit Bitcoin address. The Bitcoin Credit Union will provide an account address. The Bitcoin user will provide the direct deposit account to their employer and when they are paid the funds will be converted to bitcoins and deposited into their account. From the user this process will be transparent. The Bitcoin Credit Union will coordinate with a company/companies to provide the best exchange rate. The members will decide whether day to day operations are paid for via the initial membership fee or from a small percentage taken during the conversion. The goal will be to keep the cost down as low as possible using volunteers as much as possible for operations.\nIf you made it this far and are interested, sign up here to help move this forward.\nhttp://www.bitpools.com/?Bitcoin%20Credit%20Union\n", "views": 3161, "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWould you be interested in a Bitcoin Credit Union?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-10-04 11:07:15", "content": "arnt you already describing coinbase lol\nmany people already treat exchanges as a form of credit union (little shrimp, not whales)\nalthough making it as a 'formal' credit union might be useful.\nit can work as a little shrimp savings thing. but i would not aim it at large whales. that way its much easier to obtain liability insurance as each account can be secured against say $2k. much cheaper to insure rather than policies of $250k per account holder (banking world).\nid never recommend storing bitcoin in third parties without proper insurance. thus small account limits and affordable insurance will win this project passing the feasibility tests.\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-10-04 11:07:29", "content": "arnt you already describing coinbase lol\nmany people already treat exchanges as a form of credit union (little shrimp, not whales)\nWhile this can be done via coinbase by setting up some sort of automation, with a credit union people can skip the step of money flowing through their bank account and the problems that come with having a bank account.\nThis would be like BitPay but in reverse.

That would make things difficult. I was focusing on the US, I guess I should have clarified that. I have a credit union account with an account number and checks and everything a bank has. I can do ACH transfers, etc. A credit union is member owned, is usually for a specific purpose and not as complicated as a bank.\nIn the US when you go to get paid they ask for your direct deposit routing number and account number. The routing number is the number for the financial institution and the account number references your account. If we can get a routing number we can set up the account numbers to point to a specific Bitcoin address.\nI think if we could do like BitPay does where companies that want to accept Bitcoin with no desire to deal in Bitcoin can do so, but we can set it up so that people who are paid in fiat with no desire to deal in fiat can do so.

I can't think of any user that can pay all of their bills in bitcoin. So in the ideal situation, one would set up an account, designate a percentage of their pay to be converted to bitcoins, while the rest remains as cash in their account, accessible via ATM or check.\nIf you're not willing to go all the way and offer fiat banking services as well as bitcoin services, then there's really no advantage to this credit union idea compared to just getting paid as normal and having coo base make regular purchases from you linked bank account. If anything the later would be easier, since, again, people, do need a certain amount of fiat to survive.

I can help facilitate but cannot do it on my own, there would need to be community support of 500 to 3000 people showing an interest.\nI don't think this will ever happen, especially in developed countries. In theory people could use bitcoin as their main currency in third world countries that have very unstable economies.\nI think the costs are simply too high in order for a bitcoin CU to be a viable option.

Credit unions don't deal with commodities. You can just set that up as a club or non profit for tax purposes. Maybe apply for a 501c. Are you planning on being for profit or nonprofit?\nThe credit union is necessary to get a routing number to be used for direct deposit.\nSo you are planning on accepting deposits in fiat? I guess I got confused by franky1s post. A bank or credit unions routing number or numbers are used to identify a financial institution usually for the ACH and wire transfer system. The hurdles you will jump through to be a bank will require lots of employees and attorneys. If you are crossing state lines you will need to comply with interstate banking and branching laws which will add more employees. If you're going to deal with international customers too you may need to hire everyone on this forum to help. That's the reason these startups go out and secure big money investors first.\nSeriously, I'm not sure you could ever accomplish that without being more expensive than Circle or Coinbase.\nThe main focus would be on the ACH to access the Electronic Payments Network which allows a \"depository institution\" as defined in § 19(b) of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 461(b), this includes \"insured credit unions\".\nFederal credit union means a cooperative association organized in accordance with the provisions of this chapter for the purpose of promoting thrift among its members and creating a source of credit for provident or productive purposes;\nThe term insured credit union means any credit union the member accounts of which are insured in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of the Federal Credit Union Act.\nFor a credit union maintaining less than $50 million in deposits it is not too difficult to maintain insurance on users accounts. Especially since the Bitcoin credit union would never hold any fiat in accounts. It would immediately transfer any funds into bitcoins or to another bank account for deposit.\nYou would need insurance on the amount you have in customers' accounts until you use the money to buy the bitcoin.\nYou also need to understand that a direct deposit is little different then accepting a check (the fraud risk is reduced however) as direct deposits can be reversed for a number of reasons. A direct deposit can be charged back and can be \"nsf\". These are pretty rare, and really only happen with smaller businesses but even then they don't happen very often because most businesses make paying their employees a top priority.\nThe biggest risk is getting a direct deposit that is initiated by the customer. A few banks allow this, ING direct (which is now owned by capital one) was one of the first banks that started this, but others have jumped on the bankwaggon. I understand that there is no balance requirement for a direct deposit to be sent, but it will be reversed by the issuing bank in the event of NSF in the sending account.\nAnother risk is that the employer overpays the employee. This is somewhat common and the employer can simply reverse the amount of the overpayment from the employee's account; this is something the employee agrees to when they sign up for direct deposit.\nThis sounds a lot like coinbase but with extra regulatory costs and risks. I would suggest creating a service similar to coinbase with similar risk controls and your service will take off.\nIf someone wanted to use their entire paycheck (or any other amount) to buy bitcoin they could simply setup an automatic purchase with coinbase\nExactly. If you were to setup some kind of service that automatically buys bitcoin when a person gets their paycheck then you would need to buy the corresponding bitcoin on an exchange somehow. You would need to pay exchange fees and would encounter slippage (just like coinbase does). A much better solution would be to compete with coinbase.\nOne disadvantage you would have over coinbase is that no one would be selling their bitcoin to you (which would allow you to save on slippage and exchange fees) so from the start you will have higher costs for providing the same service.\n", "author": "funtotry Sr. Member Offline Activity: 420 Merit: 250 Ever wanted to run your own casino?

The terminals allow customers to buy mobile phone credit, pay utility bills and settle traffic fines, among other functions.\nZebraPay terminals also offer Ukash, a type of electronic money, that is popular for online games and gambling, Badea said.\nThe ZebraPay network is set to grow about 30% by years end, adding 350 new terminals by 2015, Badea said. Its machines are located in 160 cities across Romania in large supermarket chains like Carrefour, Auchan and Kaufland  some of the biggest retailers in the country.\nZebraPay competes with Qiwi in Romania.

This is just a functional of the relatively small market cap and speculation in BTC; as the market matures this will be a self-solving problem. But it's a bit silly to complain about a \"problem\" that exists only because BTC has rocketed upward in value in the past 5-6 years. That's like complaining Apple stock has a problem because it's been so profitable.\n2. It's easy to sign up on coinbase and link your bank and/or credit card to it, to buy BTC. Trivial really, and no harder than signing up for a new user account on any given retail website. So I don't buy this one either.\n3. I don't see anything unique in this - in principle you can make equivalent errors with Fiat transactions.\n4. I agree this is a problem; customers of exchanges do need to keep voting with their funds, favoring exchanges that are the most transparent and aggressive in maintaining good security. Fiat exchanges in principle could be just as vulnerable to online theft, so I see the difference here as largely one of crypto exchanges being less well-funded and they've not been around long enough or have enough experienced employees to have a full security system in place.\n5. Criminals also move fiat around on-line. Granted, the pseudo-anonymity of crypto is attractive to criminals. But it is also attractive to legitimate dissidents to repressive governments, and free citizens worldwide who shouldn't have government/neighbors/anyone else snooping on them either.\n6. With logic like that we'd still be walking and refusing to ride horses, much less drive cars! Sure you can send fiat around with a 2.9% or $10 or more transfer fee, but BTC is MUCH more efficient. And much faster. These are clear wins for crypto that will ultimately force the issue -\npeople do not like wasting money\nand BTC/altcoin transfer efficiency will steadily defeat competition over the long haul for this reason.\n7. Buyer protection is only as good as the company offering it anyway; legitimate businesses will treat customers fairly if they want to avoid a death spiral of negative publicity. I think this is the one issue BTC supporters stress about more than they should. It's not a non-issue, but long-term business self-interest makes it much less of an issue than many people think.\n8. Granted there is an intense focus by criminals on bitcoin these days; most of us here for any length of time have shrapnel in us attesting to that fact, myself included. So I'm in agreement on this one, and think we as a community need to develop and publicize best practices for individuals and businesses to defeat the scammers. If we can block 90% of the scamming with a reasonable combination of security improvements at exchanges and so forth, and increased user awareness, and improvements in wallet software and so forth, we'll hopefully drive the scammers to go chase lower hanging fruit somewhere else or just give up.\n", "author": "ebliever Legendary Offline Activity: 1582 Merit: 1011 "}, {"date": "2014-10-08 20:20:20", "content": "Problems with btc:\n1. wild, unstable exchange rate\n2. difficulty to obtain and use (for most people)\n3. getting coins hacked or lost by sending to wrong address\n4. fraud/theft at exchanges (if it happened at Gox it could happen anywhere)\n5. it enables criminals to get paid online\n6. there are already plenty of ways to send money online a lot easier, it doesnt really do anything new\n7. absolutely no buyer protection\n8. scam companies/scammers\nfeel free to add to this list ^^\ngood things:\n1. cheap way to send money\n2. only 21 mil ever in circulation\nSo why should more people start using btc?

That quote can be summarized as follows:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly zero economists endorsed [returning to the gold standard] in a recent poll ... It &lt;strong&gt;prevents the central bank from fighting recessions&lt;/strong&gt; by outsourcing monetary policy decisions to how much gold we have ... When we peg the dollar to gold we have to raise interest rates when gold is scarce, regardless of the state of the economy. &lt;strong&gt;This policy inflexibility was the major cause of the Great Depression&lt;/strong&gt;, as governments were forced to tighten policy at the worst possible moment. &lt;strong&gt;It's no coincidence that the sooner a country abandoned the gold standard, the sooner it began recovering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\nPantera continues, explaining in their own words that &lt;em&gt;\"inflation (and deflation) was much worse under the gold standard than it has been since\"&lt;/em&gt;, and that a return to such would not lead to any form of price stability.\nSo far, in their argument for bitcoin, Pantera has explained that the root cause of &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.history.com/topics/great-depression\n\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; was due to the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/1999/march/monetary-policy-and-the-great-crash-of-1929-a-bursting-bubble-or-collapsing-fundamentals/\n\"&gt;monetary inflexibility&lt;/a&gt; (of course, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.freedomworks.org/content/debunking-myths-great-depression\n\"&gt;others disagree with that assessment&lt;/a&gt;) that was imposed on countries who operated under the gold standard, that the sooner a nation abandoned the gold standard in favor of fiat currency, the sooner they recovered from the Depression, and that both inflation and depression have been far more pronounced when monetary policy is dictated by the supply of a scarce resource. While factual, I'd expect a pro-bitcoin article to gloss over such details, not emphasize them.\n[caption id=\"attachment_794\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]&lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/annoyance.php\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-full wp-image-794\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bitcoins.jpg\n\" alt=\"Physical bitcoins by Casascius, because every article about bitcoin needs a picture of them.\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/annoyance.php\n\"&gt;Physical bitcoins by Casascius&lt;/a&gt;, because every article about bitcoin needs a picture of them.[/caption]\n&lt;strong&gt;But all that is just an aside, let me continue...&lt;/strong&gt;\nCiting the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.gold.org\n\"&gt;World Gold Council&lt;/a&gt;, Pantera shows that from 2010 through 2013, world-wide demand for gold amounted to 17,500 metric tons, of which 8,400 tons were used for jewelry, 5,900 tons were purchased for investment purposes, 1,600 tons in industry, 170 tons for dentistry and 1,500 tons were purchased by central banks (if you're using a calculator, I'll admit that the numbers won't total correctly, as I did some rounding).\n&lt;strong&gt;Jewelry is not an investment in gold...&lt;/strong&gt;\nPantera assumes gold jewelry to be an investment and argues that by moving their wealth from gold jewelry to bitcoin, and Indian family's (without access to banks, but presumably with access to the internet) wealth would be much safer.\n[caption id=\"attachment_795\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"512\"]&lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.fashionstrend.co.uk/gold-jewelry-sets-collection-for-indian-brides-2013/indian-jewellery-bridal-jewellery-collection-2013-1/\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-medium wp-image-795\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/india_jewelry-512x561.jpg\n\" alt=\"Gold jewelry shouldn't be viewed as an &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot; in gold, but rather, as &amp;quot;bling&amp;quot;.  Image Source: FashionsTrend.co.uk\" width=\"512\" height=\"561\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Gold jewelry shouldn't be viewed as an \"investment\" in gold, but rather, as \"bling\".Image Source: &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.fashionstrend.co.uk/gold-jewelry-sets-collection-for-indian-brides-2013/indian-jewellery-bridal-jewellery-collection-2013-1/\n\"&gt;FashionsTrend.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;\n[/caption]\nLets first point out that jewelry is one of the worst possible ways to \"invest\" in gold. Even &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qOPhm1H4-f8J:https://www.thegoldbug.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=105&amp;amp;Itemid=115\n\"&gt;thegoldbug.com&lt;/a&gt;, (the link goes to a cached version of the site on Google's servers, as the \"real\" site has been defaced by hackers), lists investing in gold in the form of jewelry as one of the top 10 mistakes, saying:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"&lt;strong&gt;Remember that Gold Jewelry is not an Investment&lt;/strong&gt;  As with nuggets, jewelry is an unreliable source of gold. Not only is the&lt;em&gt; purity of the metal once again a concern,&lt;/em&gt; but there is also &lt;em&gt;the added artisan's premium present in all jewelry&lt;/em&gt;. The cost applied by the craftsman who made the piece will &lt;em&gt;always inflate the price well past the value of the metal alone&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, while jewelry may have value in its own right, it has &lt;em&gt;no place in the hands of an investor&lt;/em&gt; who is looking to own gold as an asset. (&lt;em&gt;Emphasis' &lt;/em&gt;are my own)&lt;/p&gt;\nEssentially, gold jewelry is a means of displaying that one has wealth, but to use the jewelry a method to store that wealth itself is a terrible idea. Whether the national currency of India is Rupees or bitcoin, Indians who want to display that they hold significant wealth will contiune to buy gold jewelry. Gold is \"blng\", and bitcoin, existing only in the form of electrons, has no \"bling\" factor. Arguing otherwise is essentially trying to argue that as a result of an ec51%onomy moving to bitcoin, that demand for &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/index\n\"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;' or &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.rolex.com\n\"&gt;Rolex&lt;/a&gt; watches will dry up. Right there, 48% of the gold demand which Pantera presumes that bitcoin could replace evaporates.\n&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoins' \"advantages\" over gold. Are they really \"advantages\"?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFurther along, when Pantera tries to explain the traits that bitcoin has but gold lacks, explaining that for gold miners to deliever the same service as bitcoin miners, they would have to provide armed guards, concealed tranaction values and a constantly updated ledger of transactions. None of these arguments make sense:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;armed guards (why? miners don't guarantee the security of the wallet file on your computer),&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;concealed transaction values (inexplicable; if I hand a gold coin to you, is that transaction not concealed from the rest of the world?), and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a constantly updated ledger (for what? an up to date ledger is essential for a digital currency, yes, but for a physical currency, a ledger is of no added value - why do i need a transaction recorded in a ledger when I have my gold in hand?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\nFurthermore, in explaining bitcoins' advantages over gold, they state that bitcoin is superior to gold due to the difficulty of theft. Dig through enought bitcoin-related discussions on &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/\n\"&gt;Reddit's bitcoin-related threads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org\n\"&gt;bitcointalk's forums&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see that whether its because of a keylogger on one's computer, an exchange not using &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication\n\"&gt;2-Factor Authentication&lt;/a&gt;, a user choosing an insecure method of generating a wallet (say, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ptuf3/brain_wallet_disaster/\n\"&gt;brainwallet&lt;/a&gt;, for example), or an &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.mtgox.com/\n\"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; declaring that all of their customers holdings are gone due to a \"bug\" in the bitcoin protocol, bitcoins can be stolen just as any other asset can be.\n&lt;strong&gt;Would nations really rely on the blockchain to store their wealth?&lt;/strong&gt;\nThey also describe the network of bitcoin miners as being a robust form of security. While presently true that achieving enough computing power to conduct a 51% attack is beyond most people means, if a nation adopted bitcoin as their currency, I could easily envision a scenario where a rival, or a group of rivals, could be motivated to discretely and covertly develop and deploy their own network of ASIC miners in order to conduct &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://econwarfare.org\n\"&gt;economic warfare&lt;/a&gt; against that  state. And unlike the \"limited\" means that most of us have that places a 51% attack out of reach, once nation-states are in the game, there is no telling how many of their resources they would devote to such an effort. Just because such an event has not yet happened &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.johnperkins.org\n\"&gt;does not mean that it won't&lt;/a&gt;, ESPECIALLY if bitcoin became the official currency of a country.\n[caption id=\"attachment_796\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"336\"]&lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0452287081&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=dioxidizedcom-20&amp;amp;linkId=2VLRWLSNPRSMT4N3\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-full wp-image-796\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/confessionshitman.jpg\n\" alt=\"Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.\" width=\"336\" height=\"506\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.[/caption]\n&lt;strong&gt;Supply Limits&lt;/strong&gt;\nAnother \"advantage\" they cite is bitcoin's strictly limited supply, compared to the continued mining of gold. I struggle to see the relevance - 165,000 metric tons of gold &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.numbersleuth.org/worlds-gold/\n\"&gt;has already been mined&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.usgs.gov\n\"&gt;US Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; that Pantera cites says that there are an esimated 52,000 metric tons of gold still remaining underground. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining continues along, creating 3600 new coins per day, and though reward halvings will continue to occur roughly every four years, the full supply of bitcoin won't have been mined until the year 2140.\nAside from that, recall earlier in their report when Pantera pointed out how the flexibility of fiat currencies was \"superior\" to the inflexibility imposed by using an asset of limited supply as a means of conducting trade. Now, it is a supposed advantage? They need to take one side of the argument or the other, not both.\n&lt;strong&gt;So where does that leave us?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFor starters, bitcoin is incapable of replacing gold in dentistry and industrial applications, two sources that contibute $66,114 to the $4.2 million final estimated value that bitcoin could achieve. Neither would bitcoin replace jewelry, as jewelry is means of displaying value, not storing it. There goes another $286,496 of their estimate. While it could and likely will be used as a means of investment, indeed, it already is, it's foolish to think that the bitcoin would replace 100% of the gold presently held either in investment portfolios or in safes. Yes, it is another instrument that people can use to invest their wealth in, but it won't erase nearly 10,000 years of human history and cause demand for holding gold as an investment to zero. Another $88,153 off of the value\n&lt;strong&gt;And the biggest item on their list, world M2 (money supply)&lt;/strong&gt;\nFirst off, to bear down on the same point yet again, circle back to Pantera's original &lt;a href=\"#Atlantic\"&gt;quote from the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; regarding the effects of a nation sticking with the gold standard versus fiat currencies, as a bitcoin denominated economy would operate in a manner far closer to one operating under the gold standard than one with fiat currency.\nSecondly, from what I just pointed out above, I have difficulty imaging any nation wanting to switch to bitcoin as their nominal currency, knowing that another nation could concievably overtake and subvert the entire network. The two biggest threats in that scenario would be the United States and China, both of whom have a deep supply of people with the necessary skillsets to design the needed hardware and the domestic production capacity to create the needed hardware without drawing any outside attention until it is too late.\n&lt;strong&gt;And where does that leave bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;\nDespite my arguments above, I believe that bitcoin is still an asset that could possess significant value; as a peer-to-peer currency, it allows individuals to send money to one another quicker than sending checks through the mail and more inexpensively that wire transfers or worse, money transfer services.\nIt can certainly be adopted by companies as a means of receiving payments to cut down on credit card processing fees. The challenge there is convincing the customer to opt to pay using bitcoin and abandon the incentives offered by credit card companies to \"charge\" their purchases. Bitcoin doesn't have reward points, for instance, and more critically, consumers lose the ability to charge back a purchase if necessary (for instance, if a company refuses to adhere to its refund policy), or, to take an example from the bitcoin community - if &lt;a style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\" href=\"\nhttp://www.butterflylabs.com\n\"&gt;Butterfl&lt;/a&gt;... I mean, a company,  takes orders for a product and doesn't ship those orders until a year had passed.\nThe lack of ability to reverse a bitcoin transaction is frequently cited as reason why biusinesses should adopt bitcoin, but there are also plenty of legitimate reasons why consumers prefer to have that ability besides try to defraud merchants.\nOne place where the lack of chargebacks shouldn't be a concern to consumers are for products/services that can't really be returned anyways. Dining. Haircuts. Digital purchases such as software or musc (an area where &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.paypal.com\n\"&gt;Paypal's&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/goodbye-passwords-one-touch-hello-bitcoin\n\"&gt;Braintree&lt;/a&gt; has already entered the market).\nBut for goods, especially from vendors whose ability or willingness to deliver those goods in a &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1w2hdk/horrors_of_butterfly_labs/\n\"&gt;timely manner might be in question&lt;/a&gt;, most consumers will likely want a payment method that allows them to dispute the charge and recoup their money if the vendor doesn't honor their obligations.\n&lt;strong&gt;That brings us to the next place where bitcoin can really shine - the remittance marketplace. &lt;/strong&gt;\nI fully expect bitcoin to either overtake or be adopted by &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/2014/09/18/remittance-a-place-where-bitcoin-can-shine-today/\n\"&gt;the remittance market&lt;/a&gt;. For it to trully dominate, though, my personal thought is that bitcoins involvement in remittanes will need to be made transparent to the end-users; a remitter would simply walk into a store and hand their money to the cashier and provide instuctions as to where to send the funds. The transfer company would then buy bitcoins and send those coins to the branch were the receiver will be picking up their funds, who would then immediately sell those coins and deliver the proceeds in the recipients currency of choice.\n[caption id=\"attachment_793\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"]&lt;img class=\"wp-image-793 size-full\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fannie-mae_stock.png\n\" alt=\"fannie-mae_stock\" width=\"500\" height=\"434\" /&gt; The dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket, whether that basket is bitcoins, litecoins, or the shares of any single company is irrelevant.[/caption]\nLastly, bitcoin can absolutely serve as a means to store wealth, but in my view, only it's only appropriate to use it as \"store of value\" as part of a diviersified investment portfolio. Asset prices flucuate - storing all of ones wealth in bitcoin should be just as frowned upon as storing all of ones wealth in shares of a single company, say, Fannie Mae, for example.\nTo conclude, while I think that bitcoin certainly has value in the future, I think that the maximum value of a single bitcoin well below the $4,291,060 estimate published by Pantera, and disagree with many of the reasons that Pantera cites that bitcoin could or should replace gold rather than being viewed as an asset to own in addition to gold (and real estate, and equities, and bonds, etc).\n", "views": 2786, "author": "lucasjkr Hero Member Offline Activity: 644 Merit: 500 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhy I think Pantera Capital is wrong in their $4.2 million/BTC estimate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-10-08 21:54:06", "content": "Personally i think they are right\nBitcoin will be worth over 1 milion $\n", "author": "Velkro Legendary Offline Activity: 1554 Merit: 1001 &lt;3 Vanity Addresses :) "}, {"date": "2014-10-08 22:02:58", "content": "Personally i think they are right\nBitcoin will be worth over 1 milion $\nThat's not realistic, but I would very much welcome it because then I don't have to work anymore.\nI think the max price it will ever reach, if ever, is $10,000 and that's a fair estimate.\n", "author": "1Referee Legendary Online Activity: 1638 Merit: 1192 "}, {"date": "2014-10-08 22:06:02", "content": "One of the best ways to assure destruction of free trade in the world, is to make Bitcoin the leading form of money in the world.\nIf the electrical grid and the Internet crashed today, fiat would survive.

Bitcoin, however, would be completely gone.\nIf the fiats of the world were ever overcome by Bitcoin to such an extent that Bitcoin threatened the economy of the fiat system, the Power Elite of the world would see to it that both the power grid and the Internet collapsed. Why? Because they are survivalists. And more than any guy with his family, and his bunkers, and his cached food supply, etc., the global Power Elite are prepared for a potential world economy flop in every way that they can think of.

That quote can be summarized as follows:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly zero economists endorsed [returning to the gold standard] in a recent poll ... It &lt;strong&gt;prevents the central bank from fighting recessions&lt;/strong&gt; by outsourcing monetary policy decisions to how much gold we have ... When we peg the dollar to gold we have to raise interest rates when gold is scarce, regardless of the state of the economy. &lt;strong&gt;This policy inflexibility was the major cause of the Great Depression&lt;/strong&gt;, as governments were forced to tighten policy at the worst possible moment. &lt;strong&gt;It's no coincidence that the sooner a country abandoned the gold standard, the sooner it began recovering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\nPantera continues, explaining in their own words that &lt;em&gt;\"inflation (and deflation) was much worse under the gold standard than it has been since\"&lt;/em&gt;, and that a return to such would not lead to any form of price stability.\nSo far, in their argument for bitcoin, Pantera has explained that the root cause of &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.history.com/topics/great-depression\n\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; was due to the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/1999/march/monetary-policy-and-the-great-crash-of-1929-a-bursting-bubble-or-collapsing-fundamentals/\n\"&gt;monetary inflexibility&lt;/a&gt; (of course, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.freedomworks.org/content/debunking-myths-great-depression\n\"&gt;others disagree with that assessment&lt;/a&gt;) that was imposed on countries who operated under the gold standard, that the sooner a nation abandoned the gold standard in favor of fiat currency, the sooner they recovered from the Depression, and that both inflation and depression have been far more pronounced when monetary policy is dictated by the supply of a scarce resource. While factual, I'd expect a pro-bitcoin article to gloss over such details, not emphasize them.\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_794\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/annoyance.php\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-full wp-image-794\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bitcoins.jpg\n\" alt=\"Physical bitcoins by Casascius, because every article about bitcoin needs a picture of them.\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/annoyance.php\n\"&gt;Physical bitcoins by Casascius&lt;/a&gt;, because every article about bitcoin needs a picture of them.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;But all that is just an aside, let me continue...&lt;/strong&gt;\nCiting the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.gold.org\n\"&gt;World Gold Council&lt;/a&gt;, Pantera shows that from 2010 through 2013, world-wide demand for gold amounted to 17,500 metric tons, of which 8,400 tons were used for jewelry, 5,900 tons were purchased for investment purposes, 1,600 tons in industry, 170 tons for dentistry and 1,500 tons were purchased by central banks (if you're using a calculator, I'll admit that the numbers won't total correctly, as I did some rounding).\n&lt;strong&gt;Jewelry is not an investment in gold...&lt;/strong&gt;\nPantera assumes gold jewelry to be an investment and argues that by moving their wealth from gold jewelry to bitcoin, and Indian family's (without access to banks, but presumably with access to the internet) wealth would be much safer.\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_795\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"512\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.fashionstrend.co.uk/gold-jewelry-sets-collection-for-indian-brides-2013/indian-jewellery-bridal-jewellery-collection-2013-1/\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-medium wp-image-795\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/india_jewelry-512x561.jpg\n\" alt=\"Gold jewelry shouldn't be viewed as an &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot; in gold, but rather, as &amp;quot;bling&amp;quot;.  Image Source: FashionsTrend.co.uk\" width=\"512\" height=\"561\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Gold jewelry shouldn't be viewed as an \"investment\" in gold, but rather, as \"bling\".Image Source: &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.fashionstrend.co.uk/gold-jewelry-sets-collection-for-indian-brides-2013/indian-jewellery-bridal-jewellery-collection-2013-1/\n\"&gt;FashionsTrend.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;Lets first point out that jewelry is one of the worst possible ways to \"invest\" in gold. Even &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qOPhm1H4-f8J:https://www.thegoldbug.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=105&amp;amp;Itemid=115\n\"&gt;thegoldbug.com&lt;/a&gt;, (the link goes to a cached version of the site on Google's servers, as the \"real\" site has been defaced by hackers), lists investing in gold in the form of jewelry as one of the top 10 mistakes, saying:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"&lt;strong&gt;Remember that Gold Jewelry is not an Investment&lt;/strong&gt;  As with nuggets, jewelry is an unreliable source of gold. Not only is the&lt;em&gt; purity of the metal once again a concern,&lt;/em&gt; but there is also &lt;em&gt;the added artisan's premium present in all jewelry&lt;/em&gt;. The cost applied by the craftsman who made the piece will &lt;em&gt;always inflate the price well past the value of the metal alone&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, while jewelry may have value in its own right, it has &lt;em&gt;no place in the hands of an investor&lt;/em&gt; who is looking to own gold as an asset. (&lt;em&gt;Emphasis' &lt;/em&gt;are my own)&lt;/p&gt;\nEssentially, gold jewelry is a means of displaying that one has wealth, but to use the jewelry a method to store that wealth itself is a terrible idea. Whether the national currency of India is Rupees or bitcoin, Indians who want to display that they hold significant wealth will contiune to buy gold jewelry. Gold is \"blng\", and bitcoin, existing only in the form of electrons, has no \"bling\" factor. Arguing otherwise is essentially trying to argue that as a result of an ec51%onomy moving to bitcoin, that demand for &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/index\n\"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;' or &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.rolex.com\n\"&gt;Rolex&lt;/a&gt; watches will dry up. Right there, 48% of the gold demand which Pantera presumes that bitcoin could replace evaporates.\n&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoins' \"advantages\" over gold. Are they really \"advantages\"?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFurther along, when Pantera tries to explain the traits that bitcoin has but gold lacks, explaining that for gold miners to deliever the same service as bitcoin miners, they would have to provide armed guards, concealed tranaction values and a constantly updated ledger of transactions. None of these arguments make sense:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;armed guards (why? miners don't guarantee the security of the wallet file on your computer),&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;concealed transaction values (inexplicable; if I hand a gold coin to you, is that transaction not concealed from the rest of the world?), and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a constantly updated ledger (for what? an up to date ledger is essential for a digital currency, yes, but for a physical currency, a ledger is of no added value - why do i need a transaction recorded in a ledger when I have my gold in hand?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\nFurthermore, in explaining bitcoins' advantages over gold, they state that bitcoin is superior to gold due to the difficulty of theft. Dig through enought bitcoin-related discussions on &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/\n\"&gt;Reddit's bitcoin-related threads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org\n\"&gt;bitcointalk's forums&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see that whether its because of a keylogger on one's computer, an exchange not using &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication\n\"&gt;2-Factor Authentication&lt;/a&gt;, a user choosing an insecure method of generating a wallet (say, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ptuf3/brain_wallet_disaster/\n\"&gt;brainwallet&lt;/a&gt;, for example), or an &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.mtgox.com/\n\"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; declaring that all of their customers holdings are gone due to a \"bug\" in the bitcoin protocol, bitcoins can be stolen just as any other asset can be.\n&lt;strong&gt;Would nations really rely on the blockchain to store their wealth?&lt;/strong&gt;\nThey also describe the network of bitcoin miners as being a robust form of security. While presently true that achieving enough computing power to conduct a 51% attack is beyond most people means, if a nation adopted bitcoin as their currency, I could easily envision a scenario where a rival, or a group of rivals, could be motivated to discretely and covertly develop and deploy their own network of ASIC miners in order to conduct &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://econwarfare.org\n\"&gt;economic warfare&lt;/a&gt; against that  state. And unlike the \"limited\" means that most of us have that places a 51% attack out of reach, once nation-states are in the game, there is no telling how many of their resources they would devote to such an effort. Just because such an event has not yet happened &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.johnperkins.org\n\"&gt;does not mean that it won't&lt;/a&gt;, ESPECIALLY if bitcoin became the official currency of a country.\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_796\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"336\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0452287081&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=dioxidizedcom-20&amp;amp;linkId=2VLRWLSNPRSMT4N3\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-full wp-image-796\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/confessionshitman.jpg\n\" alt=\"Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.\" width=\"336\" height=\"506\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Supply Limits&lt;/strong&gt;\nAnother \"advantage\" they cite is bitcoin's strictly limited supply, compared to the continued mining of gold. I struggle to see the relevance - 165,000 metric tons of gold &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.numbersleuth.org/worlds-gold/\n\"&gt;has already been mined&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.usgs.gov\n\"&gt;US Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; that Pantera cites says that there are an esimated 52,000 metric tons of gold still remaining underground. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining continues along, creating 3600 new coins per day, and though reward halvings will continue to occur roughly every four years, the full supply of bitcoin won't have been mined until the year 2140.\nAside from that, recall earlier in their report when Pantera pointed out how the flexibility of fiat currencies was \"superior\" to the inflexibility imposed by using an asset of limited supply as a means of conducting trade. Now, it is a supposed advantage? They need to take one side of the argument or the other, not both.\n&lt;strong&gt;So where does that leave us?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFor starters, bitcoin is incapable of replacing gold in dentistry and industrial applications, two sources that contibute $66,114 to the $4.2 million final estimated value that bitcoin could achieve. Neither would bitcoin replace jewelry, as jewelry is means of displaying value, not storing it. There goes another $286,496 of their estimate. While it could and likely will be used as a means of investment, indeed, it already is, it's foolish to think that the bitcoin would replace 100% of the gold presently held either in investment portfolios or in safes. Yes, it is another instrument that people can use to invest their wealth in, but it won't erase nearly 10,000 years of human history and cause demand for holding gold as an investment to zero. Another $88,153 off of the value\n&lt;strong&gt;And the biggest item on their list, world M2 (money supply)&lt;/strong&gt;\nFirst off, to bear down on the same point yet again, circle back to Pantera's original &lt;a href=\"#Atlantic\"&gt;quote from the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; regarding the effects of a nation sticking with the gold standard versus fiat currencies, as a bitcoin denominated economy would operate in a manner far closer to one operating under the gold standard than one with fiat currency.\nSecondly, from what I just pointed out above, I have difficulty imaging any nation wanting to switch to bitcoin as their nominal currency, knowing that another nation could concievably overtake and subvert the entire network. The two biggest threats in that scenario would be the United States and China, both of whom have a deep supply of people with the necessary skillsets to design the needed hardware and the domestic production capacity to create the needed hardware without drawing any outside attention until it is too late.\n&lt;strong&gt;And where does that leave bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;\nDespite my arguments above, I believe that bitcoin is still an asset that could possess significant value; as a peer-to-peer currency, it allows individuals to send money to one another quicker than sending checks through the mail and more inexpensively that wire transfers or worse, money transfer services.\nIt can certainly be adopted by companies as a means of receiving payments to cut down on credit card processing fees. The challenge there is convincing the customer to opt to pay using bitcoin and abandon the incentives offered by credit card companies to \"charge\" their purchases. Bitcoin doesn't have reward points, for instance, and more critically, consumers lose the ability to charge back a purchase if necessary (for instance, if a company refuses to adhere to its refund policy), or, to take an example from the bitcoin community - if &lt;a style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\" href=\"\nhttp://www.butterflylabs.com\n\"&gt;Butterfl&lt;/a&gt;... I mean, a company,  takes orders for a product and doesn't ship those orders until a year had passed.\nThe lack of ability to reverse a bitcoin transaction is frequently cited as reason why biusinesses should adopt bitcoin, but there are also plenty of legitimate reasons why consumers prefer to have that ability besides try to defraud merchants.\nOne place where the lack of chargebacks shouldn't be a concern to consumers are for products/services that can't really be returned anyways. Dining. Haircuts. Digital purchases such as software or musc (an area where &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.paypal.com\n\"&gt;Paypal's&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/goodbye-passwords-one-touch-hello-bitcoin\n\"&gt;Braintree&lt;/a&gt; has already entered the market).\nBut for goods, especially from vendors whose ability or willingness to deliver those goods in a &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1w2hdk/horrors_of_butterfly_labs/\n\"&gt;timely manner might be in question&lt;/a&gt;, most consumers will likely want a payment method that allows them to dispute the charge and recoup their money if the vendor doesn't honor their obligations.\n&lt;strong&gt;That brings us to the next place where bitcoin can really shine - the remittance marketplace. &lt;/strong&gt;\nI fully expect bitcoin to either overtake or be adopted by &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/2014/09/18/remittance-a-place-where-bitcoin-can-shine-today/\n\"&gt;the remittance market&lt;/a&gt;. For it to trully dominate, though, my personal thought is that bitcoins involvement in remittanes will need to be made transparent to the end-users; a remitter would simply walk into a store and hand their money to the cashier and provide instuctions as to where to send the funds. The transfer company would then buy bitcoins and send those coins to the branch were the receiver will be picking up their funds, who would then immediately sell those coins and deliver the proceeds in the recipients currency of choice.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_793\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img class=\"wp-image-793 size-full\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fannie-mae_stock.png\n\" alt=\"fannie-mae_stock\" width=\"500\" height=\"434\" /&gt; The dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket, whether that basket is bitcoins, litecoins, or the shares of any single company is irrelevant.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Lastly, bitcoin can absolutely serve as a means to store wealth, but in my view, only it's only appropriate to use it as \"store of value\" as part of a diviersified investment portfolio. Asset prices flucuate - storing all of ones wealth in bitcoin should be just as frowned upon as storing all of ones wealth in shares of a single company, say, Fannie Mae, for example.\nTo conclude, while I think that bitcoin certainly has value in the future, I think that the maximum value of a single bitcoin well below the $4,291,060 estimate published by Pantera, and disagree with many of the reasons that Pantera cites that bitcoin could or should replace gold rather than being viewed as an asset to own in addition to gold (and real estate, and equities, and bonds, etc).\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n", "author": "BADecker Legendary Online Activity: 1792 Merit: 1046 "}, {"date": "2014-10-08 23:08:35", "content": "@BADecker:\nIt's why i posted a link to the original story, rather than attempting to reformat it using simple machines forums' syntax.

That quote can be summarized as follows:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly zero economists endorsed [returning to the gold standard] in a recent poll ... It &lt;strong&gt;prevents the central bank from fighting recessions&lt;/strong&gt; by outsourcing monetary policy decisions to how much gold we have ... When we peg the dollar to gold we have to raise interest rates when gold is scarce, regardless of the state of the economy. &lt;strong&gt;This policy inflexibility was the major cause of the Great Depression&lt;/strong&gt;, as governments were forced to tighten policy at the worst possible moment. &lt;strong&gt;It's no coincidence that the sooner a country abandoned the gold standard, the sooner it began recovering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\nPantera continues, explaining in their own words that &lt;em&gt;\"inflation (and deflation) was much worse under the gold standard than it has been since\"&lt;/em&gt;, and that a return to such would not lead to any form of price stability.\nSo far, in their argument for bitcoin, Pantera has explained that the root cause of &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.history.com/topics/great-depression\n\"&gt;Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; was due to the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/1999/march/monetary-policy-and-the-great-crash-of-1929-a-bursting-bubble-or-collapsing-fundamentals/\n\"&gt;monetary inflexibility&lt;/a&gt; (of course, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.freedomworks.org/content/debunking-myths-great-depression\n\"&gt;others disagree with that assessment&lt;/a&gt;) that was imposed on countries who operated under the gold standard, that the sooner a nation abandoned the gold standard in favor of fiat currency, the sooner they recovered from the Depression, and that both inflation and depression have been far more pronounced when monetary policy is dictated by the supply of a scarce resource. While factual, I'd expect a pro-bitcoin article to gloss over such details, not emphasize them.\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_794\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/annoyance.php\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-full wp-image-794\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bitcoins.jpg\n\" alt=\"Physical bitcoins by Casascius, because every article about bitcoin needs a picture of them.\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/annoyance.php\n\"&gt;Physical bitcoins by Casascius&lt;/a&gt;, because every article about bitcoin needs a picture of them.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;But all that is just an aside, let me continue...&lt;/strong&gt;\nCiting the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.gold.org\n\"&gt;World Gold Council&lt;/a&gt;, Pantera shows that from 2010 through 2013, world-wide demand for gold amounted to 17,500 metric tons, of which 8,400 tons were used for jewelry, 5,900 tons were purchased for investment purposes, 1,600 tons in industry, 170 tons for dentistry and 1,500 tons were purchased by central banks (if you're using a calculator, I'll admit that the numbers won't total correctly, as I did some rounding).\n&lt;strong&gt;Jewelry is not an investment in gold...&lt;/strong&gt;\nPantera assumes gold jewelry to be an investment and argues that by moving their wealth from gold jewelry to bitcoin, and Indian family's (without access to banks, but presumably with access to the internet) wealth would be much safer.\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_795\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"512\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.fashionstrend.co.uk/gold-jewelry-sets-collection-for-indian-brides-2013/indian-jewellery-bridal-jewellery-collection-2013-1/\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-medium wp-image-795\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/india_jewelry-512x561.jpg\n\" alt=\"Gold jewelry shouldn't be viewed as an &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot; in gold, but rather, as &amp;quot;bling&amp;quot;.  Image Source: FashionsTrend.co.uk\" width=\"512\" height=\"561\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Gold jewelry shouldn't be viewed as an \"investment\" in gold, but rather, as \"bling\".Image Source: &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.fashionstrend.co.uk/gold-jewelry-sets-collection-for-indian-brides-2013/indian-jewellery-bridal-jewellery-collection-2013-1/\n\"&gt;FashionsTrend.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;Lets first point out that jewelry is one of the worst possible ways to \"invest\" in gold. Even &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qOPhm1H4-f8J:https://www.thegoldbug.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=105&amp;amp;Itemid=115\n\"&gt;thegoldbug.com&lt;/a&gt;, (the link goes to a cached version of the site on Google's servers, as the \"real\" site has been defaced by hackers), lists investing in gold in the form of jewelry as one of the top 10 mistakes, saying:\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"&lt;strong&gt;Remember that Gold Jewelry is not an Investment&lt;/strong&gt;  As with nuggets, jewelry is an unreliable source of gold. Not only is the&lt;em&gt; purity of the metal once again a concern,&lt;/em&gt; but there is also &lt;em&gt;the added artisan's premium present in all jewelry&lt;/em&gt;. The cost applied by the craftsman who made the piece will &lt;em&gt;always inflate the price well past the value of the metal alone&lt;/em&gt;. Therefore, while jewelry may have value in its own right, it has &lt;em&gt;no place in the hands of an investor&lt;/em&gt; who is looking to own gold as an asset. (&lt;em&gt;Emphasis' &lt;/em&gt;are my own)&lt;/p&gt;\nEssentially, gold jewelry is a means of displaying that one has wealth, but to use the jewelry a method to store that wealth itself is a terrible idea. Whether the national currency of India is Rupees or bitcoin, Indians who want to display that they hold significant wealth will contiune to buy gold jewelry. Gold is \"blng\", and bitcoin, existing only in the form of electrons, has no \"bling\" factor. Arguing otherwise is essentially trying to argue that as a result of an ec51%onomy moving to bitcoin, that demand for &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/index\n\"&gt;Mercedes&lt;/a&gt;' or &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.rolex.com\n\"&gt;Rolex&lt;/a&gt; watches will dry up. Right there, 48% of the gold demand which Pantera presumes that bitcoin could replace evaporates.\n&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoins' \"advantages\" over gold. Are they really \"advantages\"?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFurther along, when Pantera tries to explain the traits that bitcoin has but gold lacks, explaining that for gold miners to deliever the same service as bitcoin miners, they would have to provide armed guards, concealed tranaction values and a constantly updated ledger of transactions. None of these arguments make sense:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;armed guards (why? miners don't guarantee the security of the wallet file on your computer),&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;concealed transaction values (inexplicable; if I hand a gold coin to you, is that transaction not concealed from the rest of the world?), and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a constantly updated ledger (for what? an up to date ledger is essential for a digital currency, yes, but for a physical currency, a ledger is of no added value - why do i need a transaction recorded in a ledger when I have my gold in hand?)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\nFurthermore, in explaining bitcoins' advantages over gold, they state that bitcoin is superior to gold due to the difficulty of theft. Dig through enought bitcoin-related discussions on &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/\n\"&gt;Reddit's bitcoin-related threads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://bitcointalk.org\n\"&gt;bitcointalk's forums&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see that whether its because of a keylogger on one's computer, an exchange not using &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication\n\"&gt;2-Factor Authentication&lt;/a&gt;, a user choosing an insecure method of generating a wallet (say, &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ptuf3/brain_wallet_disaster/\n\"&gt;brainwallet&lt;/a&gt;, for example), or an &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.mtgox.com/\n\"&gt;exchange&lt;/a&gt; declaring that all of their customers holdings are gone due to a \"bug\" in the bitcoin protocol, bitcoins can be stolen just as any other asset can be.\n&lt;strong&gt;Would nations really rely on the blockchain to store their wealth?&lt;/strong&gt;\nThey also describe the network of bitcoin miners as being a robust form of security. While presently true that achieving enough computing power to conduct a 51% attack is beyond most people means, if a nation adopted bitcoin as their currency, I could easily envision a scenario where a rival, or a group of rivals, could be motivated to discretely and covertly develop and deploy their own network of ASIC miners in order to conduct &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://econwarfare.org\n\"&gt;economic warfare&lt;/a&gt; against that  state. And unlike the \"limited\" means that most of us have that places a 51% attack out of reach, once nation-states are in the game, there is no telling how many of their resources they would devote to such an effort. Just because such an event has not yet happened &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.johnperkins.org\n\"&gt;does not mean that it won't&lt;/a&gt;, ESPECIALLY if bitcoin became the official currency of a country.\n&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_796\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"336\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0452287081&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=dioxidizedcom-20&amp;amp;linkId=2VLRWLSNPRSMT4N3\n\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"size-full wp-image-796\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/confessionshitman.jpg\n\" alt=\"Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.\" width=\"336\" height=\"506\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Economic Warfare a real occurrence, and a nation relying on bitcoin as its national currency would be especially vulnerable.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Supply Limits&lt;/strong&gt;\nAnother \"advantage\" they cite is bitcoin's strictly limited supply, compared to the continued mining of gold. I struggle to see the relevance - 165,000 metric tons of gold &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.numbersleuth.org/worlds-gold/\n\"&gt;has already been mined&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.usgs.gov\n\"&gt;US Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt; that Pantera cites says that there are an esimated 52,000 metric tons of gold still remaining underground. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining continues along, creating 3600 new coins per day, and though reward halvings will continue to occur roughly every four years, the full supply of bitcoin won't have been mined until the year 2140.\nAside from that, recall earlier in their report when Pantera pointed out how the flexibility of fiat currencies was \"superior\" to the inflexibility imposed by using an asset of limited supply as a means of conducting trade. Now, it is a supposed advantage? They need to take one side of the argument or the other, not both.\n&lt;strong&gt;So where does that leave us?&lt;/strong&gt;\nFor starters, bitcoin is incapable of replacing gold in dentistry and industrial applications, two sources that contibute $66,114 to the $4.2 million final estimated value that bitcoin could achieve. Neither would bitcoin replace jewelry, as jewelry is means of displaying value, not storing it. There goes another $286,496 of their estimate. While it could and likely will be used as a means of investment, indeed, it already is, it's foolish to think that the bitcoin would replace 100% of the gold presently held either in investment portfolios or in safes. Yes, it is another instrument that people can use to invest their wealth in, but it won't erase nearly 10,000 years of human history and cause demand for holding gold as an investment to zero. Another $88,153 off of the value\n&lt;strong&gt;And the biggest item on their list, world M2 (money supply)&lt;/strong&gt;\nFirst off, to bear down on the same point yet again, circle back to Pantera's original &lt;a href=\"#Atlantic\"&gt;quote from the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; regarding the effects of a nation sticking with the gold standard versus fiat currencies, as a bitcoin denominated economy would operate in a manner far closer to one operating under the gold standard than one with fiat currency.\nSecondly, from what I just pointed out above, I have difficulty imaging any nation wanting to switch to bitcoin as their nominal currency, knowing that another nation could concievably overtake and subvert the entire network. The two biggest threats in that scenario would be the United States and China, both of whom have a deep supply of people with the necessary skillsets to design the needed hardware and the domestic production capacity to create the needed hardware without drawing any outside attention until it is too late.\n&lt;strong&gt;And where does that leave bitcoin?&lt;/strong&gt;\nDespite my arguments above, I believe that bitcoin is still an asset that could possess significant value; as a peer-to-peer currency, it allows individuals to send money to one another quicker than sending checks through the mail and more inexpensively that wire transfers or worse, money transfer services.\nIt can certainly be adopted by companies as a means of receiving payments to cut down on credit card processing fees. The challenge there is convincing the customer to opt to pay using bitcoin and abandon the incentives offered by credit card companies to \"charge\" their purchases. Bitcoin doesn't have reward points, for instance, and more critically, consumers lose the ability to charge back a purchase if necessary (for instance, if a company refuses to adhere to its refund policy), or, to take an example from the bitcoin community - if &lt;a style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\" href=\"\nhttp://www.butterflylabs.com\n\"&gt;Butterfl&lt;/a&gt;... I mean, a company,  takes orders for a product and doesn't ship those orders until a year had passed.\nThe lack of ability to reverse a bitcoin transaction is frequently cited as reason why biusinesses should adopt bitcoin, but there are also plenty of legitimate reasons why consumers prefer to have that ability besides try to defraud merchants.\nOne place where the lack of chargebacks shouldn't be a concern to consumers are for products/services that can't really be returned anyways. Dining. Haircuts. Digital purchases such as software or musc (an area where &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.paypal.com\n\"&gt;Paypal's&lt;/a&gt; subsidiary &lt;a href=\"\nhttps://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/goodbye-passwords-one-touch-hello-bitcoin\n\"&gt;Braintree&lt;/a&gt; has already entered the market).\nBut for goods, especially from vendors whose ability or willingness to deliver those goods in a &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1w2hdk/horrors_of_butterfly_labs/\n\"&gt;timely manner might be in question&lt;/a&gt;, most consumers will likely want a payment method that allows them to dispute the charge and recoup their money if the vendor doesn't honor their obligations.\n&lt;strong&gt;That brings us to the next place where bitcoin can really shine - the remittance marketplace. &lt;/strong&gt;\nI fully expect bitcoin to either overtake or be adopted by &lt;a href=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/2014/09/18/remittance-a-place-where-bitcoin-can-shine-today/\n\"&gt;the remittance market&lt;/a&gt;. For it to trully dominate, though, my personal thought is that bitcoins involvement in remittanes will need to be made transparent to the end-users; a remitter would simply walk into a store and hand their money to the cashier and provide instuctions as to where to send the funds. The transfer company would then buy bitcoins and send those coins to the branch were the receiver will be picking up their funds, who would then immediately sell those coins and deliver the proceeds in the recipients currency of choice.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;table id=\"attachment_793\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"500\"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img class=\"wp-image-793 size-full\" src=\"\nhttp://www.dioxidized.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fannie-mae_stock.png\n\" alt=\"fannie-mae_stock\" width=\"500\" height=\"434\" /&gt; The dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket, whether that basket is bitcoins, litecoins, or the shares of any single company is irrelevant.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Lastly, bitcoin can absolutely serve as a means to store wealth, but in my view, only it's only appropriate to use it as \"store of value\" as part of a diviersified investment portfolio. Asset prices flucuate - storing all of ones wealth in bitcoin should be just as frowned upon as storing all of ones wealth in shares of a single company, say, Fannie Mae, for example.\nTo conclude, while I think that bitcoin certainly has value in the future, I think that the maximum value of a single bitcoin well below the $4,291,060 estimate published by Pantera, and disagree with many of the reasons that Pantera cites that bitcoin could or should replace gold rather than being viewed as an asset to own in addition to gold (and real estate, and equities, and bonds, etc).\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nOr...... maybe just write it normal like 99.9% of other OPs.  Kind of hard to copy and paste on my phone.\n", "author": "jabo38 Legendary Offline Activity: 1162 Merit: 1000 mining is so 2012-2013 "}, {"date": "2014-10-10 05:02:17", "content": "If the electrical grid and the Internet crashed today, fiat would survive.

Fiat would survive because people have cash in hand. If the grid and Internet never returned, people could (not easily) go back to record keeping by hand. Bitcoin, however, would be completely gone.\nIf the fiats of the world were ever overcome by Bitcoin to such an extent that Bitcoin threatened the economy of the fiat system, the Power Elite of the world would see to it that both the power grid and the Internet collapsed. Why? Because they are survivalists. And more than any guy with his family, and his bunkers, and his cached food supply, etc., the global Power Elite are prepared for a potential world economy flop in every way that they can think of. And that includes a whole bunch of ways that might never occur to little people, simply because little people are not of the mindset of controlling nations like the Power Elite are.\nNot only are they prepared, but\nthey are the ones\nwho are stockpiling the militaries of the world with all the supplies that they need to survive and take control. Consider the United States. Consider all the armament that the Government has been giving away to law enforcement, and even to lowly coroners. The Power Elite are more prepared than anyone else, and if their fiats flopped, and Bitcoin takes over, they would crash the world, simply to remain in control.\nLet Bitcoin grow. But don't let it become BIG... at least not in its current state. If Bitcoin could be held in hand, and could be traded among the people without electronics - computer and Internet - yet retained all the encryption that it currently has, along with the ability to easily be encrypted thousands of times stronger than it currently is, then and only then might it be a candidate for world currency.\nIn the event that technology crashed in a big way, we would be back to gold and silver, and copper. Bitcoin would be completely gone. Just because we are living in a technologically advancing time, don't think that a technology crash couldn't happen, and that we are safe as we are.\nDestruction of \"free trade\" if Bitcoin(p2p currencys) becomes big? Are you stupid?\nlol\n\"Why? Because they are survivalists.\" lmao.\n\"The power elite\" are divided. Stop buying into that illuminati bs. \"They\" can't do shit these days when www destroying false information(read: propaganda.). There is a new player on the chessbord.\nWE are the ONES.\n\"teh p0wer 3lite can turn off !ntehrrrnets and then we must melt metals and buy bread lolz\" ... Yeah,  keep up with that \"nostradamus_mentality\" if you feel good about. But don't try to convince anyone that you have a clue about the future.\nDebt based Fiat is DYING and thats a well known fact.\nWhy? Because interest on loans accumulates to fast for it to be mathematically possible? oh...wait! \"but fiat iz paper money and will survive teh iL LumInAtI hAx0r turndown event on internetz, thats why fiat is goood\" YEAH, PAPER CAN WIPE MY ASS AND HELP IGNITE SUM W00D. Your point is valid.\nBut yeah, \"the global Power Elite are prepared for a potential world economy flop in every way that they can think of.\" BUT that won't still change the fact that \"the global elite\" is divided and not some concentrated unit who runs the circus, it's more complicated than that.\nAnyone who followed the last 8(10?20?50?) years eco/geopolitic would agree on that.\nPantera - Rise, type that shit on youtube asap you shitty fake liberal.\nLet Bitcoin explode and dominate the mfking world.
