Heck bitcoin could be the universe/alien technology to eliminate humans from the universe, it being a self destructing object that like a shiny fishing lure will attract everyone like a school of piranhas except we're in a barrel (earth)\nOne major thing bitcoin has taught me, is to look at everything from a lot of different perspectives. The image refracts like light through water as you change your place/position. When it was at $30 rallying to $100, my perspective was skewed, buy buy buy, believe everything you read, dont ask questions.. shut up and buy.\nI do not feel that people should just buybuybuy as much as I would like them to.. It is NOT in their best interests. Granted being on the dollar is almost as bad as being on food stamps. You teach a man to fish, do not just give him fish or else he or any creature of habit will come to expect it. And when its not there you do not know what to do cause all you ever knew was, on the first of the month that EBT card stocks up the fridge and pantry for a few more weeks.\n", "author": "CtrlAltBernanke420 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 350 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-08-26 16:20:13", "content": "I don't think btc market is so much variable, if we compare to stock market.

It should only take time and resources out of your life that you can afford to lose.\nI agree.\nBitcoin is not secure. Especially considering 1/2 the world doesnt have any education practically, and even in rich countries, most of the people, even the rich are too dumb and lazy to take the time to learn it properly. There are only a handful of bright minds who have invested in themselves. &lt;--- this is not enough to support bitcoin over the long haul.\nBitcoin is very nebulous and not black and white. There are too few very smart people involved, and way too many dumb people involved. Be careful guys.\nWhile this could be true, it could also change over time. And I think it will. The brighter minds will improve bitcoin and build an infrastructure for the less bright (profiting in the process). Bitcoin is not ready for the masses yet.

Bitcoins can be spent to anyone in the world who has a phone or computer, in minutes, with no international wire fees or chargebacks.\nInterestingly, there has been no RUN on bitcoin. And even more interesting, there is very little that would cause a run on bitcoin. Either it is stable and grows from here, or you wake up one day in the next few years and the price is at zero.  In this view, it is safer than a bank. But if a bank is backed by unlimited US GOVT MILITARY backed dollars at least for the next few years I will stick with the military.\nSome of the geopolitical shit going on in the world is fascinating when it comes to things like borders, immigration, military industrial complex.\nIf America did not have our current military, which other nation(s) would have invaded the US some 40-50-60-70 years ago. What is occurring now is almost like a zombie Apocalypse. Because there are borders, military, laws, etc, the geographical territory of the US is safe from all these foreigners(resource sucking zombies).. For now.\nWe are witnessing economic wars, currency wars, because a human war against us at the moment is a losing battle, unless you are brainwashed by ISIS.\nThis creates a horrifying orweillian future, perhaps the US govt wants chaos, so when THAT chaos passes, the relative perspective says, this feels much more safe and comfortable than it was before. Except now the govt went from huge to monstrous, and the zombies never let up, we live in fear of ISIS, favoring more military stuff inside this country. Until we are no better than ISIS as everything you consume will be regulated by the gov't.

Creating what? Another wealth sucking mechanism?\nI hope you are right and I am wrong, but if I am right and you are wrong, YOU and EVERYONE is soooooo screwed! Heck bitcoin could be the universe/alien technology to eliminate humans from the universe, it being a self destructing object that like a shiny fishing lure will attract everyone like a school of piranhas except we're in a barrel (earth)\nOne major thing bitcoin has taught me, is to look at everything from a lot of different perspectives. The image refracts like light through water as you change your place/position. When it was at $30 rallying to $100, my perspective was skewed, buy buy buy, believe everything you read, dont ask questions.. shut up and buy.\nI do not feel that people should just buybuybuy as much as I would like them to.. It is NOT in their best interests. Granted being on the dollar is almost as bad as being on food stamps.
