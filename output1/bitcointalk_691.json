I'm taking it to it's logical conclusion.\nYeah some of it is sidechains... buts it's better just to think of them as accountability ledgers... you know they just reference each other like receipts or have internal accounting systems inside the ledger or when someone registers in a different jurisdiction. It's really simple to apply to the blockchain, when I realized what it is, not to deprecate it's value, but it's incredibly secure; there is a lot of different types of data that can be securely accounted for at all times securely and at minimal cost.\nI'm thinking of the most important data that we have, our credentials, associations, appointments, etc can be cross linked using blockchains.\nThe big blockchains are able to secure data extremely well, regardless of what it is, but simply pegging a hash of another blockchain through the Bitcoin Blockchain can secure a smaller chain of limited size. The hashes embedded in the Bitcoin transaction would carry the hash of that blockchain with the latest hash of it's next transactions pending transcription in the sidechain.\nSome blockchains may be amalgamations of several blockchains working in sequence to secure it's own transactions through multiple blockchains. Merge-mining multiple blockchains, embedding blockchain hashes across multiple chains, etc.\nOthers may only exist inside another blockchain, referencing themselves through magnet-links to the blocks that constitute it's chain on the torrent network. reconstructing it's structure simply by tree-hashing up the chain.\nAnd yet others may exist simply by jumping from one Blockchain to another, barely present only leaving the embedded source of where they came from using public key cryptography to secure it's path forward.\nThe more complex forms would link secure information across multiple Data Silo blockchains, cross referencing each other through smart contracts and linking new transactions through the most secure networks: Bitcoin,Litecoin, Peercoin,etc. Even going further forming sub-connected chains of increasing complexity... chains within chains within chains. Using Homomorphic encryption techniques would carry it even further forming compute structures openly available but securely accessible to key parties.\ngiven the security of Blockchain ledgers and how ledgers cross link each other in the real world, with the addition of cryptography... this opens an incredible swath of society to a lot of opportunities in the most efficient manner possible.\nJust imagine a world where key news information could be transcribed openly in a secure manner onto a global Blockchain, that could easily disseminate to multiple channels across the planet at minimal cost without the use of complex datacenters... just a blockchain, a fee and secure awareness the news is going to reach it's destination no matter what for the whole world to se\nregistries cross referenced across the globe, so there are no hassles... your information follows you where you go ready to prove whatever you have to prove at a moments notice.\nThe Blockchain: secure information changes everything.\n", "author": "jdbtracker Hero Member Offline Activity: 720 Merit: 500 Minimum Effort/Maximum effect "}], "date": "2015-05-20 17:06:04"}, {"content": "Hi,\ndo you know a mining farm in Germany?

It is recommended to upgrade to this version.\nPlease report bugs using the issue tracker at github:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues\nUpgrading and downgrading\n=========================\nHow to Upgrade\n--------------\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nDowngrade warning\n------------------\nBecause release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and parallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:\nBlocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work anymore as a result of this.\nThe block index database will now hold headers for which no block is stored on disk, which earlier versions won?t support.\nIf you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.\nThis does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.\nNotable changes\n===============\nThis fixes a serious problem on Windows with data directories that have non-ASCII characters (\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6078\n).\nFor other platforms there are no notable changes.\nFor the notable changes in 0.10, refer to the release notes at\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0/doc/release-notes.md\n0.10.2 Change log\n=================\nDetailed release notes follow. This overview includes changes that affect external behavior, not code moves, refactors or string updates.\nWallet: - 824c011 fix boost::get usage with boost 1.58\nMiscellaneous: - da65606 Avoid crash on start in TestBlockValidity with gen=1. - 424ae66 don?t imbue boost::filesystem::path with locale ?C? on windows (fixes #6078)\nCredits\n=======\nThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n- Cory Fields\n- Gregory Maxwell\n- Jonas Schnelli\n- Wladimir J. van der Laan\nAnd all those who contributed additional code review and/or security research:\n- dexX7\n- Pieter Wuille\n- vayvanne\nAs well as everyone that helped translating on Transifex -\nhttps://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/\n", "views": 777, "author": "spaz926 Newbie Offline Activity: 7 Merit: 0 Along for the Ride ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin Core version 0.10.2 released\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-05-20 01:49:24", "content": "If that possible to download the synchronization data manually?

Join us! "}, {"date": "2015-05-19 11:27:29", "content": "The whole mobile phone idea is just a really bad joke. Let's say something like an iPhone 6 uses about 10 Wh of power to charge it (0.01 kWh):\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/iphone/11128043/How-much-power-is-used-to-charge-an-iPhone-6.html\n.\nIf we assume that 21 can make a 50 GH/s ASIC that runs at 0.1 J/GH (way way better than anything available right now) then that 10 Wh of power will last less than 2 hours while the ASIC is active (much less in fact because the Wi-Fi or LTE modems and either the main CPU or an NPU have to be active too to connect to anything).\nGiven that the single biggest complaint almost every phone user has about their phone is battery life does anyone really thing that people are going to be happy with phones that need charging every 90 minutes? Let's say they throttle back to a duty-cycle that's only 25% (6 hours when the phone is charging overnight) then the phone has a whopping 12.5 GH/s of hashing; that's 1 28 millionth of the current hash rate so to supply 50% of the network hashrate will require 28M mobile phones (at the current hash rate).\nOf course this is a zero-sum problem so those 28M phone users will between them mine half of the 25 BTC per block (going down to 12.5 BTC next year). That's 44.6 satoshis each per block (call it 45 with the tx fee). If the indications about reward sharing are correct then 21.co get 75%, or 33.75 of those 45 satoshis so our phone owner has 11.25 satoshis per block or 1620 satoshis per day. After a year they've got 591k satoshis, so that's 5.91 mBTC ($1.37 at current prices).\nAt an average of 12.5 GH/s and 0.1 J/GH then they used 24 * 12.5 * 0.1 = 30 Wh of power per day, or 10.95 kWh per year (assuming a perfect charger; not that they exist - the numbers will be higher). If the video's quoted price of $0.12 per kWh is correct (retail electricity pricing) then mining that $1.37 costs at best $1.31 but also costs the battery on the phone draining, the phone getting hotter, etc. The heat thing is not to be dismissed because phone enclosures aren't designed to dump sustained heat this way.\nBasically they'll have to persuade 28M phone owners that they should spend their electricity mining for 21.co, getting a worse phone experience and having to pay more for the phone in the process (to cover the extra ASIC and the necessary heat dissipation). Now if they persuade 56M phone owners then 21.co's mining operation is huge; it now nets them 2/3 of all of the bitcoins but our phone users now only get 3.94 mBTC ($0.91) but their costs stay the same.\nWhen the block reward halves then the numbers get much worse from the consumer's perspective. Now they have the same costs but only half of their previous reward.\nOh and here's the irony: the claim is that this is to enable \"decentralisation\" right? Well guess what, our 28M phone miners are delivering all of the blocks to 21.co's mining pool; that's 50% of the network. Can we please see the necessary freak out along the lines of when GHash.io didn't actually quite get to 50% of the network last year? Our 56M phone miners would give 21.co 66% of the network.\nRemind me again how all of this is a good idea?\n", "author": "davejh Full Member Offline Activity: 138 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-05-19 11:37:46", "content": "Excelent news.\nSo my toaster ll be mining BTC in the future.

I don't mind doing setup for my phone because I gain a lot from doing it, but what I don't get is why having BTC mining in my TV or a games console is interesting? What problem related to those devices does it solve? The funds aren't going to be large enough to do interesting micropayments. Even at 50 GH/s there's not enough BTC mined in a year to pay for a game or more than one or two TV episodes. Gets dramatically worse next year when the block reward drops to 12.5 BTC.\nUnless there's going to be major adoption by users then the OEMs won't install the capability in their hardware because it costs them money (silicon, board space, software development and maintenance, customer service calls, retailer margin).

So I'm looking for solutions now more and more intently.\n", "author": "ebliever Legendary Offline Activity: 1582 Merit: 1011 "}, {"date": "2015-05-20 20:55:02", "content": "Are you sure that u guys are not talking about sidechains ?\n", "author": "CounterEntropy Full Member Offline Activity: 149 Merit: 102 "}, {"date": "2015-05-20 21:17:35", "content": "Royal we, it's a natural outcome of where this technology will eventually take us. I'm taking it to it's logical conclusion.\nYeah some of it is sidechains... buts it's better just to think of them as accountability ledgers... you know they just reference each other like receipts or have internal accounting systems inside the ledger or when someone registers in a different jurisdiction. It's really simple to apply to the blockchain, when I realized what it is, not to deprecate it's value, but it's incredibly secure; there is a lot of different types of data that can be securely accounted for at all times securely and at minimal cost.\nI'm thinking of the most important data that we have, our credentials, associations, appointments, etc can be cross linked using blockchains.\nThe big blockchains are able to secure data extremely well, regardless of what it is, but simply pegging a hash of another blockchain through the Bitcoin Blockchain can secure a smaller chain of limited size. The hashes embedded in the Bitcoin transaction would carry the hash of that blockchain with the latest hash of it's next transactions pending transcription in the sidechain.\nSome blockchains may be amalgamations of several blockchains working in sequence to secure it's own transactions through multiple blockchains. Merge-mining multiple blockchains, embedding blockchain hashes across multiple chains, etc.\nOthers may only exist inside another blockchain, referencing themselves through magnet-links to the blocks that constitute it's chain on the torrent network. reconstructing it's structure simply by tree-hashing up the chain.\nAnd yet others may exist simply by jumping from one Blockchain to another, barely present only leaving the embedded source of where they came from using public key cryptography to secure it's path forward.\nThe more complex forms would link secure information across multiple Data Silo blockchains, cross referencing each other through smart contracts and linking new transactions through the most secure networks: Bitcoin,Litecoin, Peercoin,etc. Even going further forming sub-connected chains of increasing complexity... chains within chains within chains. Using Homomorphic encryption techniques would carry it even further forming compute structures openly available but securely accessible to key parties.\ngiven the security of Blockchain ledgers and how ledgers cross link each other in the real world, with the addition of cryptography... this opens an incredible swath of society to a lot of opportunities in the most efficient manner possible.\nJust imagine a world where key news information could be transcribed openly in a secure manner onto a global Blockchain, that could easily disseminate to multiple channels across the planet at minimal cost without the use of complex datacenters... just a blockchain, a fee and secure awareness the news is going to reach it's destination no matter what for the whole world to se\nregistries cross referenced across the globe, so there are no hassles... your information follows you where you go ready to prove whatever you have to prove at a moments notice.\nThe Blockchain: secure information changes everything.\n", "author": "jdbtracker Hero Member Offline Activity: 720 Merit: 500 Minimum Effort/Maximum effect "}], "date": "2015-05-20 17:06:04"}, {"content": "Hi,\ndo you know a mining farm in Germany?

It is recommended to upgrade to this version.\nPlease report bugs using the issue tracker at github:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues\nUpgrading and downgrading\n=========================\nHow to Upgrade\n--------------\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nDowngrade warning\n------------------\nBecause release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and parallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:\nBlocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work anymore as a result of this.\nThe block index database will now hold headers for which no block is stored on disk, which earlier versions won?t support.\nIf you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.\nThis does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.\nNotable changes\n===============\nThis fixes a serious problem on Windows with data directories that have non-ASCII characters (\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6078\n).\nFor other platforms there are no notable changes.\nFor the notable changes in 0.10, refer to the release notes at\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0/doc/release-notes.md\n0.10.2 Change log\n=================\nDetailed release notes follow. This overview includes changes that affect external behavior, not code moves, refactors or string updates.\nWallet: - 824c011 fix boost::get usage with boost 1.58\nMiscellaneous: - da65606 Avoid crash on start in TestBlockValidity with gen=1. - 424ae66 don?t imbue boost::filesystem::path with locale ?C? on windows (fixes #6078)\nCredits\n=======\nThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:\n- Cory Fields\n- Gregory Maxwell\n- Jonas Schnelli\n- Wladimir J. van der Laan\nAnd all those who contributed additional code review and/or security research:\n- dexX7\n- Pieter Wuille\n- vayvanne\nAs well as everyone that helped translating on Transifex -\nhttps://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/\n", "views": 777, "author": "spaz926 Newbie Offline Activity: 7 Merit: 0 Along for the Ride ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin Core version 0.10.2 released\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-05-20 01:49:24", "content": "If that possible to download the synchronization data manually?

Join us! "}, {"date": "2015-05-19 11:27:29", "content": "The whole mobile phone idea is just a really bad joke. Let's say something like an iPhone 6 uses about 10 Wh of power to charge it (0.01 kWh):\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/iphone/11128043/How-much-power-is-used-to-charge-an-iPhone-6.html\n.\nIf we assume that 21 can make a 50 GH/s ASIC that runs at 0.1 J/GH (way way better than anything available right now) then that 10 Wh of power will last less than 2 hours while the ASIC is active (much less in fact because the Wi-Fi or LTE modems and either the main CPU or an NPU have to be active too to connect to anything).\nGiven that the single biggest complaint almost every phone user has about their phone is battery life does anyone really thing that people are going to be happy with phones that need charging every 90 minutes? Let's say they throttle back to a duty-cycle that's only 25% (6 hours when the phone is charging overnight) then the phone has a whopping 12.5 GH/s of hashing; that's 1 28 millionth of the current hash rate so to supply 50% of the network hashrate will require 28M mobile phones (at the current hash rate).\nOf course this is a zero-sum problem so those 28M phone users will between them mine half of the 25 BTC per block (going down to 12.5 BTC next year). That's 44.6 satoshis each per block (call it 45 with the tx fee). If the indications about reward sharing are correct then 21.co get 75%, or 33.75 of those 45 satoshis so our phone owner has 11.25 satoshis per block or 1620 satoshis per day. After a year they've got 591k satoshis, so that's 5.91 mBTC ($1.37 at current prices).\nAt an average of 12.5 GH/s and 0.1 J/GH then they used 24 * 12.5 * 0.1 = 30 Wh of power per day, or 10.95 kWh per year (assuming a perfect charger; not that they exist - the numbers will be higher). If the video's quoted price of $0.12 per kWh is correct (retail electricity pricing) then mining that $1.37 costs at best $1.31 but also costs the battery on the phone draining, the phone getting hotter, etc. The heat thing is not to be dismissed because phone enclosures aren't designed to dump sustained heat this way.\nBasically they'll have to persuade 28M phone owners that they should spend their electricity mining for 21.co, getting a worse phone experience and having to pay more for the phone in the process (to cover the extra ASIC and the necessary heat dissipation). Now if they persuade 56M phone owners then 21.co's mining operation is huge; it now nets them 2/3 of all of the bitcoins but our phone users now only get 3.94 mBTC ($0.91) but their costs stay the same.\nWhen the block reward halves then the numbers get much worse from the consumer's perspective. Now they have the same costs but only half of their previous reward.\nOh and here's the irony: the claim is that this is to enable \"decentralisation\" right? Well guess what, our 28M phone miners are delivering all of the blocks to 21.co's mining pool; that's 50% of the network. Can we please see the necessary freak out along the lines of when GHash.io didn't actually quite get to 50% of the network last year? Our 56M phone miners would give 21.co 66% of the network.\nRemind me again how all of this is a good idea?\n", "author": "davejh Full Member Offline Activity: 138 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2015-05-19 11:37:46", "content": "Excelent news.\nSo my toaster ll be mining BTC in the future.

I don't mind doing setup for my phone because I gain a lot from doing it, but what I don't get is why having BTC mining in my TV or a games console is interesting? What problem related to those devices does it solve? The funds aren't going to be large enough to do interesting micropayments. Even at 50 GH/s there's not enough BTC mined in a year to pay for a game or more than one or two TV episodes. Gets dramatically worse next year when the block reward drops to 12.5 BTC.\nUnless there's going to be major adoption by users then the OEMs won't install the capability in their hardware because it costs them money (silicon, board space, software development and maintenance, customer service calls, retailer margin).
