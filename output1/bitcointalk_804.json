The remaining steps, which will be done at the same time the devices are being made, are:\nAdd Litecoin support as an easily configurable setting on the device (Thanks for helping us reach the stretch goal Litecoiners!).\nFinalize software support for creating HD wallet seeds (hopefully just in time for the release of HD wallets in our Android wallet).\nDesign packaging materials, such as boxes, inserts with instructions/warnings, etc. We will probably keep these somewhat plain though (we're going for security at lowest price, not flashiness).\nSet up distribution accounts with Amazon in USA, Europe, and Asia, since we'll be using them to fulfill most of the orders.\nDesign the t-shirts.\nAnd, of course, publish the finalized source code and hardware schematics for these devices. In case some software security issues are found, we should have plenty of time to get them fixed before we ship.\nSpeaking of the t-shirts, we'd like some feedback from you. Do you guys want t-shirts that mention Mycelium Entropy, ones that just mention Mycelium, or ones that just have our logo, but don't specifically advertise the company, with just text that, for example, says \"Ad-hoc Economy\" on them, so that if you are asked about it you can talk about either Mycelium, or just bitcoin?\nEven though Indiegogo contributions are over, we'll leave the BitPay links up for anyone who still wants to order one, and, of course, for anyone who still wants a t-shirt.\n", "views": 732, "author": "Rassah Legendary Offline Activity: 1680 Merit: 1001 Academy ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMycelium Entropy Indiegogo results\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2014-08-25 11:14:25"}, {"content": "Hey, I am currently on a vacation in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and I heard that a new bitcoin ATM was built. I looked on the internet to see where it was and it was only a 5 minute walk from my hotel. The bitcoin ATM was in a store called \"hemp and co\" (I don't like that it was in a hemp store, makes bitcoin seem more of a blackmarket currency only for hipsters and drugs) on 1102 Government Street. I went in, the machine was pretty big, looked nice. Theres a touch screen on it, with a cash output, a cash input, a hand scanner, a qr code scanner, and a credit card reader I think. I decided to try out selling the minimum amount of BTC, just for fun. The minimum amount was 20$, in 20$ increments, so I got 20$. The exchange rate was absolutely awful, it was about 100$ CAD less than the current market price, which is around a 20% reduction. I had to pay about 0.042 BTC for 20$. I didn't notice any other fees, I think the fee was put in the exchange rate. Selling was extremely simple and fast, but too fast. You click pay, and it prints out a voucher. After you click pay, you send the bitcoin to the qr code on the screen (address is also there), and it gives you I think 15 minutes to pay. You click redeem voucher once you send it, and then if your transaction was sent (doesn't need to be confirmed), it prints out your cash and away you go, no hand scanning for selling BTC. The problem with this is that it doesn't need to be confirmed. I could easily double spend that after I get my cash, and since they didn't get my handprint or anything, they couldn't track me down. Adding a confirmation would make the process take a lot longer, but maybe you could come back with your voucher 10 minutes later and redeem it then, that would be a good solution.\nOverall it was a pretty cool experience, first ATM experience with bitcoin, actually first real world experience with bitcoin, but I wouldn't use it again. I got ripped off about 0.005 BTC through a terrible exchange rate, and if you were selling a whole bitcoin, you would be ripped off 100$ CAD.\n", "views": 1076, "author": "williamj2543 Hero Member Offline Activity: 588 Merit: 500 Get ready for PrimeDice Sig Campaign!

The FinTech focused reforms that the Chancellor referred to are to start with government studies, or what Osborne calls the a major programme of work exploring the potential of virtual currencies and digital money.\nOsbourne went on to state how important virtual currencies, mobile payments and other digital financial technologies are to modern economies:\nThese alternative payment systems are popular because they are quick, cheap, and convenient  and I want to see whether we can make more use of them for the benefit of the UK economy and British consumers.\nWhile early 2014 saw the US and Japan (two of the worlds top three economies) make moves to downgrade Bitcoins status by classifying it as property rather than currency, Britain is moving in the opposite direction by embracing what peer-to-peer currencies like Bitcoin have to offer the financial sector.\nBritains interest in virtual currencies like Bitcoin is as strategic as it is forward thinking. Recall that since the end of WWII, the US dollar has long been the anchor or reserve currency used by most world governments for international trade. This global demand for dollars leads to a lower borrowing rate for the US, saving people and businesses a very advantageous $100 billion per year. If Britain can properly regulate virtual currencies, other nations may find it cheaper to finance international trade with options like Bitcoin rather than the US dollar, which can, much to the chagrin of other nations, often be used as a tool to exert American political will around the world.\nMore than 70 years ago Britains John Maynard Keynes (of Keynsian economics fame) suggested a world reserve currency called the Bancor. The idea didnt take off then, but in the here and now the regulation of virtual, stateless currencies could be a small step in that direction. Regardless, the UKs lead could cause other nations to follow, paving a legitimate path for a currency associated with nefarious dealings.\nDont expect to pay for your bangers and mash with government-regulated Bitcoin any time soon. Despite their new interest in FinTech, Britain, like most governments, rarely rushes when it comes to managing the cogs of the nations financial machinery. In addition to looking into the upside of integrating these financial innovations with the British economy, Osbornes study will also make sure that the British government is alert to the risks that accompany any new technology.\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/britain-regulate-bitcoin-legitimate-currency-2014-8\n", "views": 1694, "author": "LakeBTC Hero Member Offline Activity: 910 Merit: 1000 LakeBTC.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBritain May Embrace Bitcoin As A Legitimate Currency\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-08-11 03:06:24", "content": "Did\nAmir Taaki\ngo and see the Queen?\n", "author": "Gleb Gamow Legendary Offline Activity: 1428 Merit: 1118 "}, {"date": "2014-08-11 03:59:56", "content": "This would make Europe the safest haven for BTC globally from a reg viewpoint\nI suspect the brits are also eyeing the jobs that btc innovation could create in the UK\n", "author": "TrailingComet Sr. Member Offline Activity: 462 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-08-11 07:36:26", "content": "The brt is trying to revive the economy.

FUD FUD FUD\nIt does make sense, considering according to a article I read a while back, only 300 people in the world could of created Bitcoin back in 2009. The NSA has the worlds smartest minds working for it, and with extensive reach. I find it very plausible that Satoshi Nakamoto is simply a codename for the Bitcoin project made by the government/branch of government. It's also very likely that Satoshi was more than one person, given his extensive use of the word \"our\". It also explains why Satoshi made it a top priority to Hide his tracks, so he wouldn't be found.\nactually smart people are not automatically employed into NSA, the truth is smart people can earn alot more privately then they can on a government salary. to add to this NSA are not that smart, the fact is in the Ross ulbrich case, NSA needed to send a drive image(ISO) to the UK's GCHQ so that the british secret service could bruteforce the password.\nIt's either the person/people behind Satoshi Nakamoto worked for a branch of the government and made Bitcoin and released it to the world, or the person/people behind Satoshi Nakamoto is one hell of a genius who has extreme expertise in cryptography, which would make you question where he got his knowledge from(government, university?)\nlastly you conspiracy theorists are obsessed with trying to link bitcoin to NSA... so let me burst the big bubble for you and then let you atleast theorize some FUD that may actually hold 1% weight.\nif you researched 'satoshi' you would see that he has a british grammar and word pattern. so atleast theorize your fud to be more about UK's GCHQ.. not NSA\n.\nbut your theory really failed when you think that smart people want and decide to work for NSA. really laughable thought process you lot have, especially with a largely evident lack of research to atleast try joining some straw to some actual evidence.\nand satoshi was not the only person that helped make bitcoin. before the white paper. satoshi, hal finney, nick szabo, and another guy (with the last name that is something like wui(sorry i forgot his full name)) these were the 4 people who had code that built up bitcoin. but it was only satoshi that brought it all together into a white paper and started making version 0.1. but then hal finney popped back on the scene and satoshi, hal finney and a small group of people helped develop the first few versions, then gavin andressen joined in. jeff garzik, etc all joined in and helped out and then took over the reigns.. and today there are upto 100 different people working on the bitcoin code.\nso dont presume satoshi done it all alone, he was just the smart one to pick a bit of code here, grab a theory there, tweak another idea over there, then bring it all together into the white paper.\nTRY TO DO SOME RESEARCH NEXT TIME!!\nI don't necessarily think that bitcoin was created by any government...I mean...it's possible but there's really no evidence indicating that it was.

Their all on GHash.io because they're spooked by variance, what do you think they would do if their mining rewards were increased with fiat subsidy on top?\n", "author": "Cortex7 Full Member Offline Activity: 238 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-08-16 15:00:35", "content": "Satire or not, I am so sick or these garbage threads.

Here are some facts about them\nThere are hundreds of altcoins\nOne list counts 344 altcoins. Of course, some of these are extremely marginal. But there are 155 actively traded altcoins with a market value of at least $10,000. And 34 of them are worth more than a million dollars.\nOne of the altcoins, Dogecoin, has managed to cut through the clutter by adopting a silly internet meme as its mascot. That helped its value to skyrocket in late 2013 and early 2014. It's now the fifth-largest altcoin, with a market value of $24 million.\nMost altcoins are tiny\nIf you add up the value of all Bitcoins, the total comes to around $7.6 billion. That's more than 10 times the value of all other cryptocurrencies put together.\nBitcoin's biggest competitor is one of the first altcoins to come on the scene: Litecoin. Litecoins are worth around $274 million. The next-largest, Nxt, is worth just $60 million.\nMost altcoins are losing value against Bitcoin\nSince the start of the year, the value of one bitcoin has fallen by about 25 percent. But the leading Bitcoin competitors have had a much worse year. The biggest Bitcoin competitor, Litecoin, has lost more than half of its value since January. Another big competitor, Peercoin has fallen by 80 percent. So has Dogecoin.\nThis might be cyclical, however. Litecoin lost value for most of 2013 only to have its value spike in December. The same thing might happen again.\nNew altcoins keep popping up\nIn recent months mature altcoins have been losing value more rapidly than Bitcoin. However, every few months a new altcoin catches the public imagination and leaps into the top 10. The latest example is Darkcoin, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was officially announced in January. Its market value skyrocketed in May from $1.50 to $11.75.\nToday, the value of all Darkcoins in circulation is about $45 million.\nThe market is still figuring out the future of cryptocurrency\nWhy do we keep seeing cryptocurrencies appear, skyrocket in value, and then steadily decline? There's a ton of uncertainty about the future of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has dominated the market since its inception five years ago, and most likely it will continue to do so. But it's possible that people will find a technical flaw in Bitcoin that will lead to its collapse. Or someone might invent a competitor that has crucial features Bitcoin lacks.\nMost new altcoins try to offer technical advantages over Bitcoin. Darkcoin is focused on privacy. Litecoin is focused on faster transaction times and more democratic rules for processing transactions, a process known as mining. Nxt is designed to have a more energy-efficient mining system that's also resistant to attacks. Dogecoin emphasizes its friendly and enthusiastic community.\nWill any of these innovations provide a decisive advantage over Bitcoin? It's not very likely  Bitcoin's popularity gives it a huge advantage. But if a Bitcoin competitor does dethrone Bitcoin, whoever owns a share will become wealthy. So every time a promising new cryptocurrency comes along, a certain number of people make speculative bets on it in hopes it's a Bitcoin killer. So far none of them have been, but people keep hoping.\nSource \"\nhttp://www.vox.com/2014/6/27/5848990/5-facts-about-bitcoins-competitors\n\"\n", "views": 5101, "author": "Coinbuddy Hero Member Offline Activity: 896 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5 things you should know about Bitcoin's competitors #bitcoin #facts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-08-04 22:24:35", "content": "thanks for all information\n", "author": "paucho Jr. Member Offline Activity: 34 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2014-08-04 22:30:08", "content": "Before another coin can rise and rival BTC, BTC will have to be adopted on a grand scale...I don't see anything coming even close right now, since most companies are just starting to consider BTC (let alone a completely different coin)\n", "author": "keithers Legendary Offline Activity: 1386 Merit: 1000 This is the land of wolves now &amp; you're not a wolf "}, {"date": "2014-08-04 22:32:50", "content": "The good thing about the altcoins is that it is a sign of freedom, first of all.\nFreedom to create and to innovate.

Here are some facts about them\nThere are hundreds of altcoins\nOne list counts 344 altcoins. Of course, some of these are extremely marginal. But there are 155 actively traded altcoins with a market value of at least $10,000. And 34 of them are worth more than a million dollars.\nOne of the altcoins, Dogecoin, has managed to cut through the clutter by adopting a silly internet meme as its mascot. That helped its value to skyrocket in late 2013 and early 2014. It's now the fifth-largest altcoin, with a market value of $24 million.\nMost altcoins are tiny\nIf you add up the value of all Bitcoins, the total comes to around $7.6 billion. That's more than 10 times the value of all other cryptocurrencies put together.\nBitcoin's biggest competitor is one of the first altcoins to come on the scene: Litecoin. Litecoins are worth around $274 million. The next-largest, Nxt, is worth just $60 million.\nMost altcoins are losing value against Bitcoin\nSince the start of the year, the value of one bitcoin has fallen by about 25 percent. But the leading Bitcoin competitors have had a much worse year. The biggest Bitcoin competitor, Litecoin, has lost more than half of its value since January. Another big competitor, Peercoin has fallen by 80 percent. So has Dogecoin.\nThis might be cyclical, however. Litecoin lost value for most of 2013 only to have its value spike in December. The same thing might happen again.\nNew altcoins keep popping up\nIn recent months mature altcoins have been losing value more rapidly than Bitcoin. However, every few months a new altcoin catches the public imagination and leaps into the top 10. The latest example is Darkcoin, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that was officially announced in January. Its market value skyrocketed in May from $1.50 to $11.75.\nToday, the value of all Darkcoins in circulation is about $45 million.\nThe market is still figuring out the future of cryptocurrency\nWhy do we keep seeing cryptocurrencies appear, skyrocket in value, and then steadily decline? There's a ton of uncertainty about the future of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has dominated the market since its inception five years ago, and most likely it will continue to do so. But it's possible that people will find a technical flaw in Bitcoin that will lead to its collapse. Or someone might invent a competitor that has crucial features Bitcoin lacks.\nMost new altcoins try to offer technical advantages over Bitcoin. Darkcoin is focused on privacy. Litecoin is focused on faster transaction times and more democratic rules for processing transactions, a process known as mining. Nxt is designed to have a more energy-efficient mining system that's also resistant to attacks. Dogecoin emphasizes its friendly and enthusiastic community.\nWill any of these innovations provide a decisive advantage over Bitcoin? It's not very likely  Bitcoin's popularity gives it a huge advantage. But if a Bitcoin competitor does dethrone Bitcoin, whoever owns a share will become wealthy. So every time a promising new cryptocurrency comes along, a certain number of people make speculative bets on it in hopes it's a Bitcoin killer. So far none of them have been, but people keep hoping.\nSource \"\nhttp://www.vox.com/2014/6/27/5848990/5-facts-about-bitcoins-competitors\n\"\nlike many people have said. before anything can compete with bitcoin it needs to be invested in and have more capital thrown at it. i think right now bitcoin is surpassing everything in terms of investment and people getting into it. litecoin is really far behind. i mean u gotta do a lottttt with litecoin before its even close\n", "author": "iluvpie60 Hero Member Offline Activity: 672 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-08-24 17:22:45", "content": "Yes they have the same issues with adoption that Bitcoin is having, now if any of them found a way to solve those problems they might be bigger then Bitcoin if we don't act fast and do the same.

I looked on the internet to see where it was and it was only a 5 minute walk from my hotel. The bitcoin ATM was in a store called \"hemp and co\" (I don't like that it was in a hemp store, makes bitcoin seem more of a blackmarket currency only for hipsters and drugs) on 1102 Government Street. I went in, the machine was pretty big, looked nice. Theres a touch screen on it, with a cash output, a cash input, a hand scanner, a qr code scanner, and a credit card reader I think. I decided to try out selling the minimum amount of BTC, just for fun. The minimum amount was 20$, in 20$ increments, so I got 20$. The exchange rate was absolutely awful, it was about 100$ CAD less than the current market price, which is around a 20% reduction. I had to pay about 0.042 BTC for 20$. I didn't notice any other fees, I think the fee was put in the exchange rate. Selling was extremely simple and fast, but too fast. You click pay, and it prints out a voucher. After you click pay, you send the bitcoin to the qr code on the screen (address is also there), and it gives you I think 15 minutes to pay. You click redeem voucher once you send it, and then if your transaction was sent (doesn't need to be confirmed), it prints out your cash and away you go, no hand scanning for selling BTC. The problem with this is that it doesn't need to be confirmed. I could easily double spend that after I get my cash, and since they didn't get my handprint or anything, they couldn't track me down. Adding a confirmation would make the process take a lot longer, but maybe you could come back with your voucher 10 minutes later and redeem it then, that would be a good solution.\nOverall it was a pretty cool experience, first ATM experience with bitcoin, actually first real world experience with bitcoin, but I wouldn't use it again. I got ripped off about 0.005 BTC through a terrible exchange rate, and if you were selling a whole bitcoin, you would be ripped off 100$ CAD.\n", "views": 1076, "author": "williamj2543 Hero Member Offline Activity: 588 Merit: 500 Get ready for PrimeDice Sig Campaign!

The FinTech focused reforms that the Chancellor referred to are to start with government studies, or what Osborne calls the a major programme of work exploring the potential of virtual currencies and digital money.\nOsbourne went on to state how important virtual currencies, mobile payments and other digital financial technologies are to modern economies:\nThese alternative payment systems are popular because they are quick, cheap, and convenient  and I want to see whether we can make more use of them for the benefit of the UK economy and British consumers.\nWhile early 2014 saw the US and Japan (two of the worlds top three economies) make moves to downgrade Bitcoins status by classifying it as property rather than currency, Britain is moving in the opposite direction by embracing what peer-to-peer currencies like Bitcoin have to offer the financial sector.\nBritains interest in virtual currencies like Bitcoin is as strategic as it is forward thinking. Recall that since the end of WWII, the US dollar has long been the anchor or reserve currency used by most world governments for international trade. This global demand for dollars leads to a lower borrowing rate for the US, saving people and businesses a very advantageous $100 billion per year. If Britain can properly regulate virtual currencies, other nations may find it cheaper to finance international trade with options like Bitcoin rather than the US dollar, which can, much to the chagrin of other nations, often be used as a tool to exert American political will around the world.\nMore than 70 years ago Britains John Maynard Keynes (of Keynsian economics fame) suggested a world reserve currency called the Bancor. The idea didnt take off then, but in the here and now the regulation of virtual, stateless currencies could be a small step in that direction. Regardless, the UKs lead could cause other nations to follow, paving a legitimate path for a currency associated with nefarious dealings.\nDont expect to pay for your bangers and mash with government-regulated Bitcoin any time soon. Despite their new interest in FinTech, Britain, like most governments, rarely rushes when it comes to managing the cogs of the nations financial machinery. In addition to looking into the upside of integrating these financial innovations with the British economy, Osbornes study will also make sure that the British government is alert to the risks that accompany any new technology.\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/britain-regulate-bitcoin-legitimate-currency-2014-8\n", "views": 1694, "author": "LakeBTC Hero Member Offline Activity: 910 Merit: 1000 LakeBTC.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBritain May Embrace Bitcoin As A Legitimate Currency\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-08-11 03:06:24", "content": "Did\nAmir Taaki\ngo and see the Queen?\n", "author": "Gleb Gamow Legendary Offline Activity: 1428 Merit: 1118 "}, {"date": "2014-08-11 03:59:56", "content": "This would make Europe the safest haven for BTC globally from a reg viewpoint\nI suspect the brits are also eyeing the jobs that btc innovation could create in the UK\n", "author": "TrailingComet Sr. Member Offline Activity: 462 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-08-11 07:36:26", "content": "The brt is trying to revive the economy.

Litecoins are worth around $274 million. The next-largest, Nxt, is worth just $60 million.\nMost altcoins are losing value against Bitcoin\nSince the start of the year, the value of one bitcoin has fallen by about 25 percent.

But it's possible that people will find a technical flaw in Bitcoin that will lead to its collapse. Or someone might invent a competitor that has crucial features Bitcoin lacks.\nMost new altcoins try to offer technical advantages over Bitcoin. Darkcoin is focused on privacy. Litecoin is focused on faster transaction times and more democratic rules for processing transactions, a process known as mining. Nxt is designed to have a more energy-efficient mining system that's also resistant to attacks. Dogecoin emphasizes its friendly and enthusiastic community.\nWill any of these innovations provide a decisive advantage over Bitcoin? It's not very likely  Bitcoin's popularity gives it a huge advantage. But if a Bitcoin competitor does dethrone Bitcoin, whoever owns a share will become wealthy. So every time a promising new cryptocurrency comes along, a certain number of people make speculative bets on it in hopes it's a Bitcoin killer.
