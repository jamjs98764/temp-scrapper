This would make it so he would pay a little bit less in sales and income taxes. (nevada may not have sales tax IDR)\nI wouldn't doubt this. I think that too many people would be accepting bitcoin there for him to not be setup to accept a bitcoin payment only to be able to receive a TX (actually verify that he received it) in private later. He likely wanted to keep it on the DL that he was taking bitcoin so the tax authority would not be looking for his bitcoin related sales later down the road.\n", "author": "wasserman99 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 476 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-08-24 09:38:58", "content": "There should be a \"conspiracy theories\" sub in the off-topic section.\n", "author": "gogxmagog Legendary Offline Activity: 1218 Merit: 1000 "}], "date": "2014-08-13 15:52:31"}, {"content": "Dumbass question\nWhat if in future, for example in year 2100, the bitcoin will be used by everyone.Working for bitcoins shopping for bitcoins,paying bills,etc..

But if you plan to participate I beg you to read the full post, since maybe your concerns were already addressed.\nI would like to share with you some questions/rants/introspection about this community and Bitcoin in general. Often is hard to look inside and try to challenge what I believe is in some extent echo chambering, collective madness and a little bit of paranoia.\nThe problem I see with Bitcoin is that, despite the fact Satoshi envisioned a trust-less system, this community strives for mainstream adoption. These two scenarios are simply not compatible. We need to trust someone at some point, or the alternative is to spend great amounts of time and energy to get the expertise of a bank-grade security consultant (in addition to your day job). Maybe some people in this community can reach this level of expertise (although scandals like MtGox or Bitcoinica among others show it is not easy), but what is sure is that the most part of the world are nowhere near. And it is not because they are stupid, but because their role in society is different. They are doctors, chemists, lawyers, mechanical engineers, etc. who may excel at what they do, but they don't know (nor they care) how to set an air-gapped network with two computers communicating through the sound card.\nBefore you jump to the conclusion \"Well, if they actually don't care, they don't deserve this currency\" think about your knowledge of how antibiotics and cell division work, the distribution of mechanical/thermal stresses in an aircraft or the differences between the Otto and Diesel cycles in a four-stroke engine. It doesn't mean that you don't care about diseases, cancer, transport or energy, but that your role in society is probably different and you expect the experts on each field to 'dumb down' their findings such that newcomers can more or less understand it.\nThe problem with Bitcoin is that either you become an expert in the field and you make it all by yourself (and even then you will end up trusting the OS developers) or you will trust someone. And, at that point, why don't simply stick with Visa, who provides chargebacks if I am scammed?\nSome proposed solutions involve hardware wallets, but this solves no problem. How can we be sure that the RNG is not backdoored? Should we trust everyone in the distribution chain from development to delivery not to backdoor it, considering the huge rewards that there are in doing so? Or should we expect that everyone becomes a hardware/firmware developer with Master in embedded systems, and do it from scratch?\nMy point is that a big percentage of people here are invested in Bitcoin (either by buying early or mining) and have a veil in front of their eyes. This phenomenon is normal, it is one of the well understood human cognitive bias called 'Rationalization'. And it can be dangerous since it prevent us to see the big picture. Or, in other words, these people only want Bitcoin to succeeded because it will give them enormous riches. And I find it a wonderful, respectable reason. But we should not let it blind our rational thinking.\nThe fact that more and more merchants are accepting Bitcoin can be explained by the fact that many people (early miners and adopters) are sitting in huge stashes of Bitcoin with no way to cash them out (at least without sending an identity theft pack to a shady exchange and risking problems with your local bank). That explains why these merchants received huge amounts of transactions when they started accepting Bitcoin. It's just people cashing out. And they will probably stop accepting it once the volume of sales is not enough to balance the risks (with BitPay/Coinbase/etc and the local bank) and the costs of accepting Bitcoin.\nI'll try to debunk some commonly accepted points in this community. Feel free to counter my counterarguments:\nM) Payment with Bitcoin is easy, just sweep a QR-Code and make the payment.\nA) If you do so, you trust that Google(Android) or Apple(iOS) are not evil (modifying the RNG, keylogging you...) or incompetent (allowing a rogue third-party app to do the former). If you lose your phone (or it is stolen) your money is gone. If you are scammed by the seller, it is lost.\nM) You can minimize the losses of losing your phone if you keeping a small amount. It would be, in this case, like losing your traditional wallet.\nA) I agree, that might work. But at this point I don't see the difference with traditional metal coins and paper bills. And the risks of the previous point.\nM) Bitcoin protects you from inflation, currency manipulation, global economic disaster, etc.\nA) I agree, too. But this is exactly the 'non sequitur' fallacy. I agree that the governments (or the classes that control them) have way too much control over the currency. But this problem comes from really long ago. And the traditional way to deal with it are offshore investments. Actually, Bitcoin might be just one more investment choice (a particularly, specially risky one), but I don't see how can be anything more.\nM) But I cannot make offshore investments with my small wealth!\nA) National (or global) instabilities are a problem of the rich. If you have less wealth than a threshold ($100,000 I think?) your deposits are guaranteed. And if the crisis is so big that even that cannot be guaranteed, you'd better learn how to raise your own vegetables and how to clean water. Bitcoin could not help you in this scenario.\nM) Bitcoin is so handy to use. Just send instantly money worldwide.\nA) So are Paypal/Visa/MasterCard, etc.\nM) But they take a fee!\nA) So do the Bitcoin miners and Coinbase. Don't expect people to work for free. If you say that Visa's fee is higher... well, that doesn't seem to be a problem for most people, considering the advantages (chargebacks and insurances).\nM) My bank does not let me to send money worldwide!\nA) Western Union can send money to many places. Of course with a fee.\nM) A Bitcoin wallet cannot be frozen\nA) Bank accounts are NOT frozen for the most part of people. If you bank freezes your account often, I guess that you are still a niche market.\nAnd now the drawbacks of Bitcoin, which seems to be invisible:\n- Your wealth can be gone in a matter of seconds for reasons you might don't event understand (for non-technical but intelligent people). To put an overly complex example. Imagine that with ssltrip someone stole your Gmail credentials and modified an attachment that you then executed in another computer and it slightly changed the RNG of your Linux distribution so the successive keys where not 100% random, giving the attacker a small edge to guess your private key.\n- Centralization problem. This issue has been largely discussed and so far the solution is again, trust that the miners won't accumulate 51% of the hashing power, and if they do, they won't be evil.\n- Future transaction fees. It is not clear how it will work once the block reward is negligible.\n- Conversion to other currencies (in anonymous but somehow not shady exchanges)\n- Security. This one is for me a fatal flaw. I am yet to see a satisfactory solution, but unfortunately the current system (not only financial, but the whole society) is based in people's good-faith and reversibility when not.\n- Blackmailing, Cryptolocker: here is where my first point point of \"[...] and a little bit of paranoia\" comes. One might believe by reading this forum that the current financial establishment (from the IMF to your local bank branch) have just one thing in mind: \"Screw you\". Although economic incentives might turn evil the greatest saint, the most part of the times there are reasons for their decisions. Anonymous transfers incentive thefts and blackmail. Transfers to conflictive countries are likely to be used for illicit purposes (when was the last time you sold something to a Nigerian customer?). Not always, of course, and that is how Bayesian reasoning works. If all you know about a person is that is it interested in making an anonymous payment to Iran (for example), the bank thinks the worst and freezes his account. Then, ideally, they will contact the person and update their 'beliefs' about this client, and with this new information they can choose to unfreeze the account. The system may be perverted at some points, but I don't think it is 'evil' from the roots.\ntl;dr\nBitcoin has many drawbacks: Centralization (Damocle's sword), security (even with hardware wallets), shady exchanges, blackmailing. And the advantages are not more than investing in offshore assets and selling them when you need money (so, one could keep wealth in a varied portfolio of offshore assets/shares/commodities/whatever and sell them to fiat in order to make transfers using the traditional banking system (or Western Union, or whatnot).\nI didn't mention the two most common red herrings (in my view): price instability and deflation.\nI would like to be proven wrong in a peaceful, rational debate. I am sure that newcomers often wonder about these issues, and they cannot find satisfactory answers anywhere.\nI have a flashback of Orwell's Animal Farm, where the humans are the bankers. Boxer the horse is the hard-working, idealist people in the \"Project Development\" subforum.

If you lose your phone (or it is stolen) your money is gone. If you are scammed by the seller, it is lost.\nThe answer to Bitcoin's security problem is very simple: do not place all your trust in one place. A very simple example: suppose a traditional wallet on your average person's computer. One set of keys in one place. Very easy to steal. Vulnerable to drive-by exploits, trojans, social engineering attacks - etc. But we can add as many keys and factors as we need to protect a wallet. If the standard Bitcoin client included SMS security codes, it would make stealing coins extremely difficult. Now you need control over the victim's phone to move money and they can issue the final approval by inputting a code. Ultra-paranoid mode would use additional isolated devices.\nThough I agree that realistically, anyone can be hacked given enough time and effort... but there does come a point where the probability vs reward isn't worth it for the attacker. Creating these conditions is trivial.\nI agree, that might work. But at this point I don't see the difference with traditional metal coins and paper bills. And the risks of the previous point.\nA better idea would be to use multiple redundant keys. Once again, there is no reason to put all your eggs in one basket. With the above security proposal - backup keys could be written to a USB drive or encrypted and saved to a remote server at wallet creation for use in the event that access to the phone was lost.

Before answering the points I consider the most relevant, I noticed some hostility in some of the answers, stating things like I hate Bitcoin and even the reason, apparently because I was scammed to bankrupcy. Since I want to keep the discussion focused on Bitcoin, I will answer briefly your concerns.\nI absolutely do not hate Bitcoin. What is more, I already made my part to the community selling some at the time. With Paypal indeed. And no, I was not scammed one single time. I stopped because it was more a proof of concept, I enjoyed building the system but not so much running it and, above all, because I discovered that in the US one can buy a prepaid SIM card withoud providing ID.\nThe tone of some of the answers really shocked me. I did not expect to make people angry and that raises some concerns about how do we interpret this. I had seen this reaction with extremely religious and political people, but never in a technical field (maybe in some Windows/Linux and XBox/PS2 discussions among teenagers). In other threads I saw how some users are pushing their friends to join in, others who invest all their life savings and some who blame the victim when someone loses their wallet. Being myself passionate about Bitcoin, I am doing this exercice of scientific skepticism to try to validate my beliefs about this matter. I am educated about the technicalities of Bitcoin and I follow the current news. I would like to invite you to make this exercise of introspection with a neutral and passion-less mentality.\nNow I would answer some of your most interesting points. Thank you again for your time.\nBitcoin gives me the freedom to easily and securely store and transfer value without the help of a middleman or the permission of an authority.\nIn a world of ever increasing capital controls, yes I need this freedom.\nDoes it require some responsibility on my part? Of course. Freedom isn't free.\nYou are right, and this is an important fact. Nevertheless, I fail to see the practical implications in the everyday life. Could you please provide an example were these controls pose a regular problem to people? It is true that it would be hard to move large capitals to another country, but people do not have regulations to pay for groceries, electronics or a house, for example.\nSimple don't use an PRNG.\nHere is a very powerful, unhackable and easy to use RNG\nGood point.

I already explained what happened to my site and why I don't think that it is relevant. Anyway, even if I were scammed, what does it have to do with the security of the currency?\nA)I agree, that might work. But at this point I don't see the difference with traditional metal coins and paper bills. And the risks of the previous point.\nIf someone steals my wallet full of fiat usd there is little hope of getting my cash back. If someone steals by cellphone with my bitcoin wallet that is secured than I can retrieve and use my bitcoins with my backup and the thief has almost no chance of using or stealing my bitcoins.\nGood point. You solved the problem of losing/stealing the phone. But there is still the problem with malware. Sure, fiat has it too, and it happens often. But with fiat these problems are reversible, with Bitcoin unfortunately they are not.\nA)  I agree that the governments (or the classes that control them) have way too much control over the currency. But this problem comes from really long ago. And the traditional way to deal with it are offshore investments.\nOffshore investments are much more expensive and complicated to setup than bitcoin.

Your deposits are not guaranteed to do anything but decrease in value. You can guarantee that you will lose 5-8% a year in the US and 25-55% in countries like Argentina. You are also making the false assumption that Fiat currencies never fail completely as history has shown otherwise.\nThat is a good point, fiat currencies can lose all their value.\nA)   So are Paypal/Visa/MasterCard, etc.\nMaking the assumption that the unbanked and underbanked don't exist in the world. How provincial.\nA)  Security\nBitcoin is as secure or insecure as you choose to make it. Example - selling Bitcoin for paypal fiat is just plain stupid.\nI appreciate your passion and I understand that it is a sensitive subject. I'd rather keep the tone neutral and a rational discussion.\nA)    If you say that Visa's fee is higher... well, that doesn't seem to be a problem for most people, considering the advantages (chargebacks and insurances).\nXapo and other merchants offer insurance as well. Clients can use escrow to protect themselves and businesses prefer not to deal with chargebacks.\nThe problem I see with escrow is that it must be trusted by both parties. These entities (trusted by many people) will be scarce and thus they can impose high fees. In addition, these trusted entities can always side with the buyer (for example) if they chose to. Is it the same as Paypal? Isn't it centralization? Theoretically you can use whatever payment gateway you can find, but the trusted ones are few (Paypal and few others).\nA)    Bank accounts are NOT frozen for the most part of people. If you bank freezes your account often, I guess that you are still a niche market.\nBank accounts are temporarily frozen or permanently all the time for many people even if they are conducting 100% legal business.

You don't think hackers attack traditional fiat too?\nCrackers attack the fiat system all the time. And they succeed. And you call the bank and have your money back. With Bitcoin you call the Waaaahmbulance (I liked that picture!).\nA)    Centralization problem.\nSo because there is a risk of less decentralization with Bitcoin we should go straight back to using a centralized solution instead. What is your point?\nMy point is that I'd rather trust an established system with accountability and traceability than an anonymous mining pool without accountability to make them self-control. I think it is immensely more likely that a mining pool starts a 51% attack to take as many Bitcoin as possible and then disappear than my government to start printing money non-stop and the responsibles disappear. Of course it could happend (and happened, unfortunately, as well as in Bitcoin with MtGox, Bitcoinica et al and their hacks). I am just talking about posibilities. Nirvana fallacy if you want. Just because the current banking system is not perfect it doesn't mean that we need to go all-in in an experimental, anonymous currency.\nA)  Anonymous transfers incentive thefts and blackmail.\nYou are ignoring all the thefts and corruption that exist within Fiat that dwarfs the corruption scam artists using bitcoin. You don't have to be anonymous to steal money from people. People can easily be manipulated into thinking that they aren't being robbed blind. one example out of many - Economists now have over 5 different ways of calculating the CPI. When they normally cite inflation they use the formula that doesn't include food or fuel. Real inflation is actually closer to 5-8 % in the US.

But again, the fact that you can extort with fiat doesn't mean we should use a currency with which extorsion can be easier.\nA)  ....price instability and deflation.\nVolatility is a valid criticism but Bitcoin is provably becoming more stable so in the longterm should not be an issue. The deflationary spiral argument is unfounded and research from payment processors like Bitpay have proven that spending actually increases during rapid deflationary bubbles.\nI meant that I don't find these two criticisms valid. Price volatility and deflation have nothing to do with Bitcoin itself.

I'd rather keep the tone neutral and a rational discussion.\nI apologize for coming off rash but my reaction was prompted after reviewing some of your post history and seeing multiple negative posts criticizing bitcoin. I take it that you are just cynical and extremely skeptical which is fine but some of us get tired of hearing the same myths propagate repeatedly. It is sometimes difficult to identify the detractors with an agenda from those offering healthy criticism.\nThe problem I see with escrow is that it must be trusted by both parties. These entities (trusted by many people) will be scarce and thus they can impose high fees. In addition, these trusted entities can always side with the buyer (for example) if they chose to. Is it the same as Paypal? Isn't it centralization? Theoretically you can use whatever payment gateway you can find, but the trusted ones are few (Paypal and few others).\nEscrow in Bitcoin is actually very inexpensive.. Multisig allows escrow to be free in most cases and only if there is a dispute there is a fee which is less expensive. Because Multisig removes counter party trust there is 0 risk that the arbitrator can independently steal the funds and thus allows for many arbitrators to compete driving down prices further. In fact anyone can become an arbitrator.\nHere is one example of a marketplace of arbitrators for multisig escrow:  https://www.bitrated.com\nCrackers attack the fiat system all the time.

Nevertheless, when I make a payment (as a customer) I feel much more comfortable paying with Paypal than with any other payment method (unless of course the seller is well known and respected as Amazon or Dell). \"Accepted by Paypal\" tells me two things about a site: (a) that they wouldn't be doing business with Paypal for long if they were scammers and (b) that I can get my money back if things go bad.\nOf course, with Bitcoin and escrow one could do the same thing.

If Bitcoin makes to the economy what the Internet made to the information I am sure that interesting times are coming.\nYou have done a great job of summarizing my argument. The beauty of the Bitcoin protocol is that it is designed in such a way that it encapsulates voluntarism and agorism at a protocol layer. Certainly, any government or person with any political ideology can use Bitcoin and benefit from its feature sets but at a design level no one can be forced into using bitcoin or upgrading to another version with features that they don't agree with(I.E... blacklisting). Bitcoin just IS, and like pandora's box cannot be removed or completely controlled by regulators. Society is going to have to adapt to this reality despite their misgivings. Mathematics is the great equalizer which allows individual people to have certain protections equal to even the most powerful organizations.\nBitcoin has its flaws and will never be perfect but right now has many qualities which make it more honest and safer if you understand it than traditional banking. There are some radical transparency and accountability features that can be used:\nIf you have a charity or are running a crowd-funding campaign you can accept donations where all donors or investors can clearly see the funds accountable in real time that are 99.999% verifiable. You can than use a M of N multi-sig to ensure that it is impossible for the treasurer or any individual to embezzle the funds or spend them without the agreed upon consensus within the bylaws. In the past a long drawn out legal battle would ensue with any dispute with parasitic lawyers milking both sides and with Bitcoin the protocol protects everyone.\nBlockchain technology and crypto-currency is a black swan event. Many of us are unapologetically embracing the cleansing effect of its disruption. Whether its Bitcoin(most likely) or another crypto-currency doesn't matter, the effects of this technology is going to change everything just like the internet has.\n", "author": "inBitweTrust Hero Member Offline Activity: 658 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-08-23 14:09:43", "content": "The person who really interested about bitcoin he or she needs bitcoin.

If you learn about transactions enough you can even broadcast your transactions with no fee, so you can move your coins for free (this is frowned upon and your transactions can often be ignored by miners).\nThe list of benefits and innovations the Bitcoin protocol provides seems too long to list here or to even derive from reading Satoshi's paper alone. You will need to research this subject for quite sometime to get a good grasp on the expansive answer to your question.\nMy recommendation is to stay away from alternative blockchains, if this is what your asking about, it is quite easy to produce altcoins and some people can make new coins in under hours, some websites/services offer coin generators. Most newbies think they can invest in altcoins and it is something new and exciting but *most* most tend to be pump/dumps and they will flutter out. If their is some serious or necessary innovation made to the bitcoin protocol, their is a good chance if it is beneficial enough and has little/no repercussions it can and might be implemented into an official client.\n", "author": "juju Sr. Member Offline Activity: 382 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-07-17 01:05:35", "content": "next generation currency is for example Litecoin....bitcoin is the old one.\n(dont hate me\n)\nmore like Vertcoin .\nhow are those reptiles doing\nit's like 23 cents now! the highest i saw it was like 1.30 or something.

Mining means monopoly of the manufacturers and is environtment wise not ethical I think. For those reasons alone the future belongs to cryptos which do not require extensive mining.\nPerhaps you can judge yourselves ...\nWHAT WOULD A CRYPTO CURRENCY COLLAPSE LOOK LIKE?\nToday the entity Crypto currency is split broadly into 3 groups,  lets define them because each one is very important to the future of digital decentralized money.\nGroup 1. Monopoly mined long distribution Crypto currency.\nThese are much more like Stocks than money or currency , they have all the parameters of being a payment system but are generally fixed to a solid cap, i.e there will never be more than a certain hard wired cap, they also can not be priced because they are in effect price manipulated by the issuers (which hold a monopoly on the issuance)\nPopular names include:\nBitcoin\nLitecoin\nGroup 2. IPO financial products Derivatives and non crypto currency.\nThese products seems to have taken the idea of a the Bitcoin monopoly and generally expanded on it often these include products that use one monopoly crypto currency (Bitcoin) to pay for the other IPO issuance, these are certainly the murkier side to crypto currecny often honestly defined as complete Ponzi schemes and Shell games, some are quasi toted as crypto currency when they dont even have a decentralized Ledger.\nPopular names include:\nNXT\nALL the protocols ( counter-party etc)\nRipple\nStellar\nEther\nCrypto currency cant be IPOd the trust is literally shifted to; the trust and good will of an anonymous person on the internet.\nGroup 3. Crypto currency that has adhered to or is currently adhering to general principals of neutral control\nThese are Crypto currency that due to good design,  core code innovation or sometimes just plain accident have been able to be mined but not be able to be controlled by a minority of people or a small group working in concert.\nso this means that the issuance is not controlled by any single party so that is to say there is neutral control over the issuance of the units.\nthis and these Crypto currency are effectively priced by the free market.\nI will give names and explanations:\nQuark\nMultiple Hashes  (hash complexity) + a 6 month primary mining period meant that all units where dumped onto the market but were primarily mined by 1000s CPU, this meant that the market quickly took effect of the roughly 240 million units and priced them immediately.\nMyriad\nMyraid uses an Hash complexity innovation that allows 5 different sectors to mine the entity all simultaneously this in effect means that no single entity (or mining group) can gain a monopoly over any part of the mining, and its working quite effectively, Myriad will have roughly 2 Billion units and the market is pricing them appropriately at this time.\nPrimecoin\nPrime uses it Proof of Work system to find Prime numbers and the key innovation is this work is essentially completed by CPU  it seems to be sufficiently complex enough that effective monopoly has been difficult to obtain and maintain.\nThe Accidents\nThere are a host of marginal (former monopoly) crypto that by accident or trust collapse are now (more or less) floating in the free market and priced as such, these accidents are a microcosm of the events for group 1.\nThe pending collapse  :\nAll Monopoly systems (group 1) can hold a high price valuation only as long as they can hold on to that mining monopoly and have trust in their small group of monopoly issuers, as I write this that trust is breaking down.\nso out of our iii Groups only group 3 is priced now by the free market.\nThe Reserve status of (group 1) crypto currency is the key reason why this collapse will be an event, because obviously Bitcoin and Litecoin have first leader brand status and primarily Bitcoins high (manipulated) valuation has caused it to be a key cross against many of its clones on most crypto exchanges.\nwe will likely see many exchanges literally collapse on a significant break down in price valuation.\nCollapse Steps:\ni - Monopoly starts to fail, volatility rises flash crashes as key trust members cash out.\nii - Volume becomes thin as the monopoly failure causes a market freeze,  lets explain this:\nthis is caused by new players continually selling small amounts, and then as new players get access to larger amounts of the monopoly, the price manipulators become fearful of faking volume as a new player might dump a significant  sell on a normally fake buy, so in a complete monopoly the buyer and the seller are the same entity, they are in effect only paying for trading fees (if that)  to fake exchange volume, i.e selling back and forth to themselves.\nhowever if and when the monopoly is lost a fake buy (or a set of fake buys) goes in and bam a new seller (outside monopoly) fills that whole group of orders.\nwhat just happened?\nthe fake buyer was using capital they would normally recycle back into a sell now they have to find new capital (fiat dollars) to continue to try to manipulate exchange volume.\nin a complete manipulated market this matters a lot, and capital can become very thin very quickly, especially if the market is as holographic as many assume.\niii - Stand off and collapse.\nThe market freeze causes other trust members to realize that the game is likely up, this causes a further standoff as new players are either building supply to dump or in a very market driven manner trickle selling.\nonce a declining trend begins some key trust players will know that its only a matter of time before new players dump and get what they can,  so thus, some trust members may move and sell first.\nthis could result in a terminal decline of some monopoly crypto, as some,  due to the flawed design with regard to the way they are mined will perhaps be unable to recover.\nSummary &amp; the effects.\nBitcoin is  a Key reserve currency to many other cryptocurrency so a collapse (of monopoly and valuation) will have a large effect on most of the cryptocurrency in the market;  many of the monopoly clones will simply collapse and disappear ( as they had no support and were only used as a vehicle to gain more Bitcoin)\nIn a monopoly collapse situation, the most truly decentralized are the most robust.\nThese are the crypto with decentralized support and well designed core code, and by definition and design are priced by the free market, they have a community of individual miners both solo and in pool groups.\nkey crypto brands stand to gain;  these are of course the group that are already now defined, these are generally group 3, (and few possible others) there will certainly be disruptions but at this time we might say reality will define which crypto currency is robust and which crypto currency is a holographic monopoly.\n", "views": 727, "author": "l3sny Hero Member Offline Activity: 862 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thypothetical scenarios on the collapse of bitcoin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2014-08-23 14:16:37"}, {"content": "High quality global journalism requires investment.

At its proudest moment the price of one unit of the much-ballyhooed virtual currency was $1,242, which meant the value of all the Bitcoins in the world was just under $14bn.\nThese days it trades mostly in a range of $450-$650 a coin and at a market cap of $6.5bn. The jury is still out on whether the Bitcoin technology will prove robust and the currency itself will find mainstream use.

But if you plan to participate I beg you to read the full post, since maybe your concerns were already addressed.\nI would like to share with you some questions/rants/introspection about this community and Bitcoin in general. Often is hard to look inside and try to challenge what I believe is in some extent echo chambering, collective madness and a little bit of paranoia.\nThe problem I see with Bitcoin is that, despite the fact Satoshi envisioned a trust-less system, this community strives for mainstream adoption. These two scenarios are simply not compatible. We need to trust someone at some point, or the alternative is to spend great amounts of time and energy to get the expertise of a bank-grade security consultant (in addition to your day job). Maybe some people in this community can reach this level of expertise (although scandals like MtGox or Bitcoinica among others show it is not easy), but what is sure is that the most part of the world are nowhere near. And it is not because they are stupid, but because their role in society is different. They are doctors, chemists, lawyers, mechanical engineers, etc. who may excel at what they do, but they don't know (nor they care) how to set an air-gapped network with two computers communicating through the sound card.\nBefore you jump to the conclusion \"Well, if they actually don't care, they don't deserve this currency\" think about your knowledge of how antibiotics and cell division work, the distribution of mechanical/thermal stresses in an aircraft or the differences between the Otto and Diesel cycles in a four-stroke engine. It doesn't mean that you don't care about diseases, cancer, transport or energy, but that your role in society is probably different and you expect the experts on each field to 'dumb down' their findings such that newcomers can more or less understand it.\nThe problem with Bitcoin is that either you become an expert in the field and you make it all by yourself (and even then you will end up trusting the OS developers) or you will trust someone. And, at that point, why don't simply stick with Visa, who provides chargebacks if I am scammed?\nSome proposed solutions involve hardware wallets, but this solves no problem. How can we be sure that the RNG is not backdoored? Should we trust everyone in the distribution chain from development to delivery not to backdoor it, considering the huge rewards that there are in doing so? Or should we expect that everyone becomes a hardware/firmware developer with Master in embedded systems, and do it from scratch?\nMy point is that a big percentage of people here are invested in Bitcoin (either by buying early or mining) and have a veil in front of their eyes. This phenomenon is normal, it is one of the well understood human cognitive bias called 'Rationalization'. And it can be dangerous since it prevent us to see the big picture. Or, in other words, these people only want Bitcoin to succeeded because it will give them enormous riches. And I find it a wonderful, respectable reason. But we should not let it blind our rational thinking.\nThe fact that more and more merchants are accepting Bitcoin can be explained by the fact that many people (early miners and adopters) are sitting in huge stashes of Bitcoin with no way to cash them out (at least without sending an identity theft pack to a shady exchange and risking problems with your local bank). That explains why these merchants received huge amounts of transactions when they started accepting Bitcoin. It's just people cashing out. And they will probably stop accepting it once the volume of sales is not enough to balance the risks (with BitPay/Coinbase/etc and the local bank) and the costs of accepting Bitcoin.\nI'll try to debunk some commonly accepted points in this community. Feel free to counter my counterarguments:\nM) Payment with Bitcoin is easy, just sweep a QR-Code and make the payment.\nA) If you do so, you trust that Google(Android) or Apple(iOS) are not evil (modifying the RNG, keylogging you...) or incompetent (allowing a rogue third-party app to do the former). If you lose your phone (or it is stolen) your money is gone. If you are scammed by the seller, it is lost.\nM) You can minimize the losses of losing your phone if you keeping a small amount. It would be, in this case, like losing your traditional wallet.\nA) I agree, that might work. But at this point I don't see the difference with traditional metal coins and paper bills. And the risks of the previous point.\nM) Bitcoin protects you from inflation, currency manipulation, global economic disaster, etc.\nA) I agree, too. But this is exactly the 'non sequitur' fallacy. I agree that the governments (or the classes that control them) have way too much control over the currency. But this problem comes from really long ago. And the traditional way to deal with it are offshore investments. Actually, Bitcoin might be just one more investment choice (a particularly, specially risky one), but I don't see how can be anything more.\nM) But I cannot make offshore investments with my small wealth!\nA) National (or global) instabilities are a problem of the rich. If you have less wealth than a threshold ($100,000 I think?) your deposits are guaranteed. And if the crisis is so big that even that cannot be guaranteed, you'd better learn how to raise your own vegetables and how to clean water. Bitcoin could not help you in this scenario.\nM) Bitcoin is so handy to use. Just send instantly money worldwide.\nA) So are Paypal/Visa/MasterCard, etc.\nM) But they take a fee!\nA) So do the Bitcoin miners and Coinbase. Don't expect people to work for free. If you say that Visa's fee is higher... well, that doesn't seem to be a problem for most people, considering the advantages (chargebacks and insurances).\nM) My bank does not let me to send money worldwide!\nA) Western Union can send money to many places. Of course with a fee.\nM) A Bitcoin wallet cannot be frozen\nA) Bank accounts are NOT frozen for the most part of people. If you bank freezes your account often, I guess that you are still a niche market.\nAnd now the drawbacks of Bitcoin, which seems to be invisible:\n- Your wealth can be gone in a matter of seconds for reasons you might don't event understand (for non-technical but intelligent people). To put an overly complex example. Imagine that with ssltrip someone stole your Gmail credentials and modified an attachment that you then executed in another computer and it slightly changed the RNG of your Linux distribution so the successive keys where not 100% random, giving the attacker a small edge to guess your private key.\n- Centralization problem. This issue has been largely discussed and so far the solution is again, trust that the miners won't accumulate 51% of the hashing power, and if they do, they won't be evil.\n- Future transaction fees. It is not clear how it will work once the block reward is negligible.\n- Conversion to other currencies (in anonymous but somehow not shady exchanges)\n- Security. This one is for me a fatal flaw. I am yet to see a satisfactory solution, but unfortunately the current system (not only financial, but the whole society) is based in people's good-faith and reversibility when not.\n- Blackmailing, Cryptolocker: here is where my first point point of \"[...] and a little bit of paranoia\" comes. One might believe by reading this forum that the current financial establishment (from the IMF to your local bank branch) have just one thing in mind: \"Screw you\". Although economic incentives might turn evil the greatest saint, the most part of the times there are reasons for their decisions. Anonymous transfers incentive thefts and blackmail. Transfers to conflictive countries are likely to be used for illicit purposes (when was the last time you sold something to a Nigerian customer?). Not always, of course, and that is how Bayesian reasoning works. If all you know about a person is that is it interested in making an anonymous payment to Iran (for example), the bank thinks the worst and freezes his account. Then, ideally, they will contact the person and update their 'beliefs' about this client, and with this new information they can choose to unfreeze the account. The system may be perverted at some points, but I don't think it is 'evil' from the roots.\ntl;dr\nBitcoin has many drawbacks: Centralization (Damocle's sword), security (even with hardware wallets), shady exchanges, blackmailing. And the advantages are not more than investing in offshore assets and selling them when you need money (so, one could keep wealth in a varied portfolio of offshore assets/shares/commodities/whatever and sell them to fiat in order to make transfers using the traditional banking system (or Western Union, or whatnot).\nI didn't mention the two most common red herrings (in my view): price instability and deflation.\nI would like to be proven wrong in a peaceful, rational debate. I am sure that newcomers often wonder about these issues, and they cannot find satisfactory answers anywhere.\nI have a flashback of Orwell's Animal Farm, where the humans are the bankers.

If you are scammed by the seller, it is lost.\nThe answer to Bitcoin's security problem is very simple: do not place all your trust in one place. A very simple example: suppose a traditional wallet on your average person's computer. One set of keys in one place. Very easy to steal. Vulnerable to drive-by exploits, trojans, social engineering attacks - etc. But we can add as many keys and factors as we need to protect a wallet. If the standard Bitcoin client included SMS security codes, it would make stealing coins extremely difficult. Now you need control over the victim's phone to move money and they can issue the final approval by inputting a code. Ultra-paranoid mode would use additional isolated devices.\nThough I agree that realistically, anyone can be hacked given enough time and effort... but there does come a point where the probability vs reward isn't worth it for the attacker.

Before answering the points I consider the most relevant, I noticed some hostility in some of the answers, stating things like I hate Bitcoin and even the reason, apparently because I was scammed to bankrupcy. Since I want to keep the discussion focused on Bitcoin, I will answer briefly your concerns.\nI absolutely do not hate Bitcoin. What is more, I already made my part to the community selling some at the time. With Paypal indeed. And no, I was not scammed one single time. I stopped because it was more a proof of concept, I enjoyed building the system but not so much running it and, above all, because I discovered that in the US one can buy a prepaid SIM card withoud providing ID.\nThe tone of some of the answers really shocked me. I did not expect to make people angry and that raises some concerns about how do we interpret this. I had seen this reaction with extremely religious and political people, but never in a technical field (maybe in some Windows/Linux and XBox/PS2 discussions among teenagers). In other threads I saw how some users are pushing their friends to join in, others who invest all their life savings and some who blame the victim when someone loses their wallet. Being myself passionate about Bitcoin, I am doing this exercice of scientific skepticism to try to validate my beliefs about this matter. I am educated about the technicalities of Bitcoin and I follow the current news. I would like to invite you to make this exercise of introspection with a neutral and passion-less mentality.\nNow I would answer some of your most interesting points. Thank you again for your time.\nBitcoin gives me the freedom to easily and securely store and transfer value without the help of a middleman or the permission of an authority.\nIn a world of ever increasing capital controls, yes I need this freedom.\nDoes it require some responsibility on my part? Of course. Freedom isn't free.\nYou are right, and this is an important fact. Nevertheless, I fail to see the practical implications in the everyday life. Could you please provide an example were these controls pose a regular problem to people? It is true that it would be hard to move large capitals to another country, but people do not have regulations to pay for groceries, electronics or a house, for example.\nSimple don't use an PRNG.\nHere is a very powerful, unhackable and easy to use RNG\nGood point. After all one cannot have both security and convenience. But careful when intutively using systems as throwing two dices.

I already explained what happened to my site and why I don't think that it is relevant. Anyway, even if I were scammed, what does it have to do with the security of the currency?\nA)I agree, that might work. But at this point I don't see the difference with traditional metal coins and paper bills. And the risks of the previous point.\nIf someone steals my wallet full of fiat usd there is little hope of getting my cash back. If someone steals by cellphone with my bitcoin wallet that is secured than I can retrieve and use my bitcoins with my backup and the thief has almost no chance of using or stealing my bitcoins.\nGood point. You solved the problem of losing/stealing the phone. But there is still the problem with malware. Sure, fiat has it too, and it happens often. But with fiat these problems are reversible, with Bitcoin unfortunately they are not.\nA)  I agree that the governments (or the classes that control them) have way too much control over the currency.

Clients can use escrow to protect themselves and businesses prefer not to deal with chargebacks.\nThe problem I see with escrow is that it must be trusted by both parties. These entities (trusted by many people) will be scarce and thus they can impose high fees. In addition, these trusted entities can always side with the buyer (for example) if they chose to. Is it the same as Paypal? Isn't it centralization? Theoretically you can use whatever payment gateway you can find, but the trusted ones are few (Paypal and few others).\nA)    Bank accounts are NOT frozen for the most part of people. If you bank freezes your account often, I guess that you are still a niche market.\nBank accounts are temporarily frozen or permanently all the time for many people even if they are conducting 100% legal business.

You don't think hackers attack traditional fiat too?\nCrackers attack the fiat system all the time. And they succeed. And you call the bank and have your money back. With Bitcoin you call the Waaaahmbulance (I liked that picture!).\nA)    Centralization problem.\nSo because there is a risk of less decentralization with Bitcoin we should go straight back to using a centralized solution instead. What is your point?\nMy point is that I'd rather trust an established system with accountability and traceability than an anonymous mining pool without accountability to make them self-control. I think it is immensely more likely that a mining pool starts a 51% attack to take as many Bitcoin as possible and then disappear than my government to start printing money non-stop and the responsibles disappear. Of course it could happend (and happened, unfortunately, as well as in Bitcoin with MtGox, Bitcoinica et al and their hacks). I am just talking about posibilities. Nirvana fallacy if you want. Just because the current banking system is not perfect it doesn't mean that we need to go all-in in an experimental, anonymous currency.\nA)  Anonymous transfers incentive thefts and blackmail.\nYou are ignoring all the thefts and corruption that exist within Fiat that dwarfs the corruption scam artists using bitcoin. You don't have to be anonymous to steal money from people. People can easily be manipulated into thinking that they aren't being robbed blind. one example out of many - Economists now have over 5 different ways of calculating the CPI. When they normally cite inflation they use the formula that doesn't include food or fuel. Real inflation is actually closer to 5-8 % in the US. This is theft and hurts the middle class and poor more-so.\nYes, I see your point. But again, the fact that you can extort with fiat doesn't mean we should use a currency with which extorsion can be easier.\nA)  ....price instability and deflation.\nVolatility is a valid criticism but Bitcoin is provably becoming more stable so in the longterm should not be an issue. The deflationary spiral argument is unfounded and research from payment processors like Bitpay have proven that spending actually increases during rapid deflationary bubbles.\nI meant that I don't find these two criticisms valid. Price volatility and deflation have nothing to do with Bitcoin itself. They are just market eventualities and, as you say, it will stabilize over time.\n", "author": "ghgr Jr. Member Offline Activity: 59 Merit: 0 To know where GOTO we gotta know where we COMEFROM "}, {"date": "2014-07-18 20:11:58", "content": "every couple of week we have some post like this!\ndo we really need bitcoin!

I'd rather keep the tone neutral and a rational discussion.\nI apologize for coming off rash but my reaction was prompted after reviewing some of your post history and seeing multiple negative posts criticizing bitcoin. I take it that you are just cynical and extremely skeptical which is fine but some of us get tired of hearing the same myths propagate repeatedly. It is sometimes difficult to identify the detractors with an agenda from those offering healthy criticism.\nThe problem I see with escrow is that it must be trusted by both parties. These entities (trusted by many people) will be scarce and thus they can impose high fees. In addition, these trusted entities can always side with the buyer (for example) if they chose to. Is it the same as Paypal? Isn't it centralization? Theoretically you can use whatever payment gateway you can find, but the trusted ones are few (Paypal and few others).\nEscrow in Bitcoin is actually very inexpensive.. Multisig allows escrow to be free in most cases and only if there is a dispute there is a fee which is less expensive. Because Multisig removes counter party trust there is 0 risk that the arbitrator can independently steal the funds and thus allows for many arbitrators to compete driving down prices further. In fact anyone can become an arbitrator.\nHere is one example of a marketplace of arbitrators for multisig escrow:  https://www.bitrated.com\nCrackers attack the fiat system all the time. And they succeed. And you call the bank and have your money back. With Bitcoin you call the Waaaahmbulance (I liked that picture!).\nWhen someone steals my credit card, I am responsible for a 50 dollar deductible and all of the loss eventually comes back to hurt me and the rest of society. Merchant fees of 3-8% raise the prices of all goods and services. You don't get your money back,\nthe loss is just abstracted and amortized.\nIn the future with hardware wallets bitcoin will become much more secure as well.\nMy point is that I'd rather trust an established system with accountability and traceability than an anonymous mining pool without accountability to make them self-control.\nMy point is the banks and governments have already betrayed the public's trust repeatedly and are not accountable.\nThey are corrupt and incompetent and should not be trusted.  Decentralized mining pools have a much better track record.\nI would personally rather deal with a hypothetical risk than a definite bad actor.\nYes, I see your point. But again, the fact that you can extort with fiat doesn't mean we should use a currency with which extorsion can be easier.\nExtortion isn't just easier with Fiat but a central part of its design. Extortion and theft is an intrinsic property of Fiat and happens continuously.\n", "author": "inBitweTrust Hero Member Offline Activity: 658 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-07-19 08:05:27", "content": "In order to make a steady state economy possible, we need debt-free money.  FRB money, which includes all fiat and even some gold, bears interest and thus it requires the economy to grow exponentially, forever.  If you belive exponential growth forever in a finite world then I wish you a great carrier in economics...\nBitcoin is essentially the only game in town when it comes to equity money (since physical gold is  hopelessly impractical).

Nevertheless, when I make a payment (as a customer) I feel much more comfortable paying with Paypal than with any other payment method (unless of course the seller is well known and respected as Amazon or Dell). \"Accepted by Paypal\" tells me two things about a site: (a) that they wouldn't be doing business with Paypal for long if they were scammers and (b) that I can get my money back if things go bad.\nOf course, with Bitcoin and escrow one could do the same thing. Maybe one day the \"Using escrow with inBitweTrust\" (for example) will transmit the same level of customer protection as today Paypal. Now I understand better the real practical applications of multisig transactions.\nIt is sometimes difficult to identify the detractors with an agenda from those offering healthy criticism.\nI completely understand that posts like that of \"LET'S CRASH BITCOIN\" are tiresome and sometimes outright trolling.

On the other hand I don't completely agree with you about the economics of arbitrators, but well, time will say if they are cheap or expensive. Anyway, what I find a clear advantage is that the escrow is not needed in a normal scenario and, above all, it cannot steal the funds (as could theoretically Paypal do today).\nWhen someone steals my credit card, I am responsible for a 50 dollar deductible and all of the loss eventually comes back to hurt me and the rest of society.

If Bitcoin makes to the economy what the Internet made to the information I am sure that interesting times are coming.\nYou have done a great job of summarizing my argument. The beauty of the Bitcoin protocol is that it is designed in such a way that it encapsulates voluntarism and agorism at a protocol layer. Certainly, any government or person with any political ideology can use Bitcoin and benefit from its feature sets but at a design level no one can be forced into using bitcoin or upgrading to another version with features that they don't agree with(I.E... blacklisting). Bitcoin just IS, and like pandora's box cannot be removed or completely controlled by regulators. Society is going to have to adapt to this reality despite their misgivings. Mathematics is the great equalizer which allows individual people to have certain protections equal to even the most powerful organizations.\nBitcoin has its flaws and will never be perfect but right now has many qualities which make it more honest and safer if you understand it than traditional banking. There are some radical transparency and accountability features that can be used:\nIf you have a charity or are running a crowd-funding campaign you can accept donations where all donors or investors can clearly see the funds accountable in real time that are 99.999% verifiable. You can than use a M of N multi-sig to ensure that it is impossible for the treasurer or any individual to embezzle the funds or spend them without the agreed upon consensus within the bylaws. In the past a long drawn out legal battle would ensue with any dispute with parasitic lawyers milking both sides and with Bitcoin the protocol protects everyone.\nBlockchain technology and crypto-currency is a black swan event. Many of us are unapologetically embracing the cleansing effect of its disruption. Whether its Bitcoin(most likely) or another crypto-currency doesn't matter, the effects of this technology is going to change everything just like the internet has.\n", "author": "inBitweTrust Hero Member Offline Activity: 658 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-08-23 14:09:43", "content": "The person who really interested about bitcoin he or she needs bitcoin.

Bitcoin, for the most part is limited in what it can do where as 2nd generation coins can have assets exchanges, automated transactions(programable transactions), voting systems, games built on top of them, the ability to pay dividend automatically to shareholders of assets on the asset exchange, eBay like physical goods store and digital goods store, to name a few.\nMy favorite one is the combination of asset exchange and multigateway which turn the platform I'm talking about into the first fully p2p decentralized trustless cryptocoin exchange.\nThere is a vast amount more you can do with second gen coins. Extra functions can be added very easily how ever with bitcoin it is virtually impossible.\nThey are also around 1300 Times less energy hungry and somewhere in the same region cheaper to run.\nTransaction Times are much faster, bitcoin being 10 min confirmations (at best) and second generation 1 min (will be instant in a few months &lt;2 seconds)\nThere is so much more but I can't think of everything\nI'm mainly talking about nxt by the way.\n**some one please tell me that it suffers from history attack or nothing at stake or that it's not secure so I can prove you wrong**\n", "author": "kodtycoon Legendary Offline Activity: 1078 Merit: 1002 "}, {"date": "2014-07-17 00:33:32", "content": "When i read about bitcoin, i often see concept of \"next generation currency\".

So, i can't understand difference between \"next generation\" and bitcoin now.\nWhat does mean \"next generation\" termine, and what currency belong \"next generation\", what currency don't belong that???\nThis should explain some of the concepts about what makes Bitcoin a \"next generation currency\":\nhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\nJust some keynotes, Bitcoin is a digital currency that removes an element of trust and allows for a user to store personal wealth securely without the need of a financial institution who will typically tax or charge you for transactions, transfers etc.\nBitcoin allows for funds to be transferred digitally across the world securely to anyone else with a Bitcoin Address, this is without you having to trust anyone with your funds to arrive at the destination. If you learn about transactions enough you can even broadcast your transactions with no fee, so you can move your coins for free (this is frowned upon and your transactions can often be ignored by miners).\nThe list of benefits and innovations the Bitcoin protocol provides seems too long to list here or to even derive from reading Satoshi's paper alone. You will need to research this subject for quite sometime to get a good grasp on the expansive answer to your question.\nMy recommendation is to stay away from alternative blockchains, if this is what your asking about, it is quite easy to produce altcoins and some people can make new coins in under hours, some websites/services offer coin generators. Most newbies think they can invest in altcoins and it is something new and exciting but *most* most tend to be pump/dumps and they will flutter out. If their is some serious or necessary innovation made to the bitcoin protocol, their is a good chance if it is beneficial enough and has little/no repercussions it can and might be implemented into an official client.\n", "author": "juju Sr. Member Offline Activity: 382 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-07-17 01:05:35", "content": "next generation currency is for example Litecoin....bitcoin is the old one.\n(dont hate me\n)\nmore like Vertcoin .\nhow are those reptiles doing\nit's like 23 cents now! the highest i saw it was like 1.30 or something.

For those reasons alone the future belongs to cryptos which do not require extensive mining.\nPerhaps you can judge yourselves ...\nWHAT WOULD A CRYPTO CURRENCY COLLAPSE LOOK LIKE?\nToday the entity Crypto currency is split broadly into 3 groups,  lets define them because each one is very important to the future of digital decentralized money.\nGroup 1. Monopoly mined long distribution Crypto currency.\nThese are much more like Stocks than money or currency , they have all the parameters of being a payment system but are generally fixed to a solid cap, i.e there will never be more than a certain hard wired cap, they also can not be priced because they are in effect price manipulated by the issuers (which hold a monopoly on the issuance)\nPopular names include:\nBitcoin\nLitecoin\nGroup 2. IPO financial products Derivatives and non crypto currency.\nThese products seems to have taken the idea of a the Bitcoin monopoly and generally expanded on it often these include products that use one monopoly crypto currency (Bitcoin) to pay for the other IPO issuance, these are certainly the murkier side to crypto currecny often honestly defined as complete Ponzi schemes and Shell games, some are quasi toted as crypto currency when they dont even have a decentralized Ledger.\nPopular names include:\nNXT\nALL the protocols ( counter-party etc)\nRipple\nStellar\nEther\nCrypto currency cant be IPOd the trust is literally shifted to; the trust and good will of an anonymous person on the internet.\nGroup 3. Crypto currency that has adhered to or is currently adhering to general principals of neutral control\nThese are Crypto currency that due to good design,  core code innovation or sometimes just plain accident have been able to be mined but not be able to be controlled by a minority of people or a small group working in concert.\nso this means that the issuance is not controlled by any single party so that is to say there is neutral control over the issuance of the units.\nthis and these Crypto currency are effectively priced by the free market.\nI will give names and explanations:\nQuark\nMultiple Hashes  (hash complexity) + a 6 month primary mining period meant that all units where dumped onto the market but were primarily mined by 1000s CPU, this meant that the market quickly took effect of the roughly 240 million units and priced them immediately.\nMyriad\nMyraid uses an Hash complexity innovation that allows 5 different sectors to mine the entity all simultaneously this in effect means that no single entity (or mining group) can gain a monopoly over any part of the mining, and its working quite effectively, Myriad will have roughly 2 Billion units and the market is pricing them appropriately at this time.\nPrimecoin\nPrime uses it Proof of Work system to find Prime numbers and the key innovation is this work is essentially completed by CPU  it seems to be sufficiently complex enough that effective monopoly has been difficult to obtain and maintain.\nThe Accidents\nThere are a host of marginal (former monopoly) crypto that by accident or trust collapse are now (more or less) floating in the free market and priced as such, these accidents are a microcosm of the events for group 1.\nThe pending collapse  :\nAll Monopoly systems (group 1) can hold a high price valuation only as long as they can hold on to that mining monopoly and have trust in their small group of monopoly issuers, as I write this that trust is breaking down.\nso out of our iii Groups only group 3 is priced now by the free market.\nThe Reserve status of (group 1) crypto currency is the key reason why this collapse will be an event, because obviously Bitcoin and Litecoin have first leader brand status and primarily Bitcoins high (manipulated) valuation has caused it to be a key cross against many of its clones on most crypto exchanges.\nwe will likely see many exchanges literally collapse on a significant break down in price valuation.\nCollapse Steps:\ni - Monopoly starts to fail, volatility rises flash crashes as key trust members cash out.\nii - Volume becomes thin as the monopoly failure causes a market freeze,  lets explain this:\nthis is caused by new players continually selling small amounts, and then as new players get access to larger amounts of the monopoly, the price manipulators become fearful of faking volume as a new player might dump a significant  sell on a normally fake buy, so in a complete monopoly the buyer and the seller are the same entity, they are in effect only paying for trading fees (if that)  to fake exchange volume, i.e selling back and forth to themselves.\nhowever if and when the monopoly is lost a fake buy (or a set of fake buys) goes in and bam a new seller (outside monopoly) fills that whole group of orders.\nwhat just happened?\nthe fake buyer was using capital they would normally recycle back into a sell now they have to find new capital (fiat dollars) to continue to try to manipulate exchange volume.\nin a complete manipulated market this matters a lot, and capital can become very thin very quickly, especially if the market is as holographic as many assume.\niii - Stand off and collapse.\nThe market freeze causes other trust members to realize that the game is likely up, this causes a further standoff as new players are either building supply to dump or in a very market driven manner trickle selling.\nonce a declining trend begins some key trust players will know that its only a matter of time before new players dump and get what they can,  so thus, some trust members may move and sell first.\nthis could result in a terminal decline of some monopoly crypto, as some,  due to the flawed design with regard to the way they are mined will perhaps be unable to recover.\nSummary &amp; the effects.\nBitcoin is  a Key reserve currency to many other cryptocurrency so a collapse (of monopoly and valuation) will have a large effect on most of the cryptocurrency in the market;  many of the monopoly clones will simply collapse and disappear ( as they had no support and were only used as a vehicle to gain more Bitcoin)\nIn a monopoly collapse situation, the most truly decentralized are the most robust.\nThese are the crypto with decentralized support and well designed core code, and by definition and design are priced by the free market, they have a community of individual miners both solo and in pool groups.\nkey crypto brands stand to gain;  these are of course the group that are already now defined, these are generally group 3, (and few possible others) there will certainly be disruptions but at this time we might say reality will define which crypto currency is robust and which crypto currency is a holographic monopoly.\n", "views": 727, "author": "l3sny Hero Member Offline Activity: 862 Merit: 1000 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thypothetical scenarios on the collapse of bitcoin\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2014-08-23 14:16:37"}, {"content": "High quality global journalism requires investment.

At its proudest moment the price of one unit of the much-ballyhooed virtual currency was $1,242, which meant the value of all the Bitcoins in the world was just under $14bn.\nThese days it trades mostly in a range of $450-$650 a coin and at a market cap of $6.5bn. The jury is still out on whether the Bitcoin technology will prove robust and the currency itself will find mainstream use. If the answer to either question is no, then no amount of hot air is likely to keep the price at current levels.\nHigh quality global journalism requires investment.
