Most users of bitcoin are in it for the profit, not in it for the innovation and the coin per se. Most even use it as a means of getting more fiat rather than keeping bitcoin as bitcoin. They didn't even use it for payments or everyday use, they just hoard it (or hodl) thinking that prices would skyrocket and change it to fiat.\nIn my opinion people who wants the value to increase and wants rapid mainstream adoption will be responsible for bitcoin to never go mainstream, the blockchain will though, people will be transfering fiat between eachothers using the bitcoin blockchain or another one, but what is the point of having a blockchain in the background doing all the work and fiat on top of it? people will have no incentive to use the actual bitcoin, merchants will probably in the future have fiat denomination for their digital payment, and all transactions that were previously cash could be monitored by government with the help of bitcoin banks like coinbase and circle.\nOne of the awesome things about bitcoin is that it helps understand how money works in our current system, it raises very interesting questions, it educated people about what actually is money and also raises awarness about current manipulated fiat system.\nI care about the value, not that much.

Also, blockchain without bitcoin is pointless, because the concept of the block chain ledger is made for bitcoin.\nPersonnaly i think that's a good thing that we have many different crypto currencies, some very interesting open source projects of bitcoin ecosystem could very easily be rolled out on another crypto but i just think that bitcoin is not heading in the right direction because people do not give it the time to.\nThere are cryptocurrencies with good technologies with it, it's just that people also use those to gain more btc in order to have more fiat. Bitcoin users are really giving the time for bitcoin to see widespread adoption. Some even educate others to use bitcoin as well.

Actually thinking about killing this and copy the amd files over.\nIndeed as long as bitcoin does not have a more stable price tag and is slow in processing ( do not understand me wrong here international its probably still darn fast, if you do compare it to bank transfers ) we have ideal in my country which is probably the fastest avialable, the payements are as fast as the connection is.\nThe money gets to the seller in seconds and needs no confirmations.\nSecond best is credit/debit cards which can be pretty fast as well in most cases still much faster than btc, but this comes with a price tag.\nMining is a thing of the paste for most people on the planet, only those with deep pockets and/or large stash of btc probably can stay in the mining game.\n", "author": "bronan Hero Member Offline Activity: 776 Merit: 500 Lazy Lurker Reads Alot "}, {"date": "2015-05-01 11:11:59", "content": "I don't agree.

Much appreciated.\nOvernight, my mind drifted to a popular UK government scheme called National Savings &amp; Investments\nhttp://www.nsandi.com/\n.\nMillions of people buy government bonds through small purchases. In return each bond serial number is entered into a random draw and a prize fund is distributed ranging from £10 - £1m to individual winners.\nThe more bonds you have the more chances you have of winning the jackpot.\nThe underlying economics of this model are:\n* You don't lose your initial stake, you lend the money to the UK government.\n* The UK government doesn't give you a guarantee you will get anything in return for your loan.\n* The UK government enters your bonds serial numbers into a weekly draw (not sure of period) and most people get some form of payout over a 12 month period.\n* The target winnings are, on average, at equivalent and competitive lending rates for the government - it pays out to winning bond holds a few percentage points per person on average over a year.\nA variant of this and a lottery might have a slim chance of working for Bitcoin node holders. Their BTC address could be associated to their serial bond which is picked out at random on a weekly basis. Their bond number could be linked to their Bitnodes address / IP address, but held elsewhere to remove the link between the users IP and their Bitcoin address.\nThe extra effort to make this step would be desirable to make it easier for novices to host full nodes without having to change BTC addresses if they didn't know why they needed to do that when they first get started.\nWith an element of chance added, a full node might win the equivalent of a Block reward, or possibly smaller denominations which could be enough for people to consider their costs to own a full node as worth the bet.  Some weeks they might get enough to cover costs, some weeks they might make a small profit, some weeks they might hit the jackpot, but some weeks they might not get anything.\nThe problem is funding the incentives.\n* You could tell people to loan money as a bond which will be sent off as loans to traders via exchanges, generating 0.45% interest charges per day (apparently this goes on at these high borrowing levels), and that could generate the rewards for the network.\n* You could ask vendors to add a 0.001% full nodes tax to their sales to fund the incentives.\nIt's messy, but I might ponder on it a little more.\n", "author": "coins101 Legendary Offline Activity: 1442 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-04-30 15:31:42", "content": "The problem is funding the incentives.\nThe problem is identifying who really is a full node.

There was probably a time when only crypto enthusiasts were aware of it - what caused the non-enthusiasts to take interest?\nIn the area where I live most people in the general public relate bitcoin to crime. Most of the bitcoin news in the major media relates to cyber crime, exchange fraud, silk road trial, etc., etc. So yes, there is attention from non-enthusiasts but it's generally a negative impression.\nTo make matters worse, try to logically explain to your dear neighbor why he should run out and buy bitcoin so he can make purchases with it. When he asks why he should take the additional step of buying bitcoins so he can then buy something that he could have bought anyway without the additional step, tell him because it's fun and easy.\nThe average person has no incentive to use Bitcoin until certain places offer discounts for doing so. Businesses should know that as they expand their sales in Bitcoin then they have the benefits of no charge backs and lower transaction costs so they should be looking to incentivize Bitcoin use by offering a break on their prices for it. W/o more of that happening or being able to only get a certain thing by paying w/ Bitcoin, then there is no use for the general public to use it. Most upwardly mobile people that are natives of a country don't have relatives in other parts of the world where they'd use Bitcoin for remittance. Aside from that, they only way folks will want Bitcoin is if they know of the deflationary effect and that by holding it, they'll become wealthier over time.

Most users of bitcoin are in it for the profit, not in it for the innovation and the coin per se. Most even use it as a means of getting more fiat rather than keeping bitcoin as bitcoin. They didn't even use it for payments or everyday use, they just hoard it (or hodl) thinking that prices would skyrocket and change it to fiat.\nIn my opinion people who wants the value to increase and wants rapid mainstream adoption will be responsible for bitcoin to never go mainstream, the blockchain will though, people will be transfering fiat between eachothers using the bitcoin blockchain or another one, but what is the point of having a blockchain in the background doing all the work and fiat on top of it? people will have no incentive to use the actual bitcoin, merchants will probably in the future have fiat denomination for their digital payment, and all transactions that were previously cash could be monitored by government with the help of bitcoin banks like coinbase and circle.\nOne of the awesome things about bitcoin is that it helps understand how money works in our current system, it raises very interesting questions, it educated people about what actually is money and also raises awarness about current manipulated fiat system.\nI care about the value, not that much. In fact, it is\nThere are still bitcoin users who are dedicated on the improvements and innovations made in bitcoin, and they care less about the value more than anything else.

Also, blockchain without bitcoin is pointless, because the concept of the block chain ledger is made for bitcoin.\nPersonnaly i think that's a good thing that we have many different crypto currencies, some very interesting open source projects of bitcoin ecosystem could very easily be rolled out on another crypto but i just think that bitcoin is not heading in the right direction because people do not give it the time to.\nThere are cryptocurrencies with good technologies with it, it's just that people also use those to gain more btc in order to have more fiat.

Much appreciated.\nOvernight, my mind drifted to a popular UK government scheme called National Savings &amp; Investments\nhttp://www.nsandi.com/\n.\nMillions of people buy government bonds through small purchases. In return each bond serial number is entered into a random draw and a prize fund is distributed ranging from £10 - £1m to individual winners.\nThe more bonds you have the more chances you have of winning the jackpot.\nThe underlying economics of this model are:\n* You don't lose your initial stake, you lend the money to the UK government.\n* The UK government doesn't give you a guarantee you will get anything in return for your loan.\n* The UK government enters your bonds serial numbers into a weekly draw (not sure of period) and most people get some form of payout over a 12 month period.\n* The target winnings are, on average, at equivalent and competitive lending rates for the government - it pays out to winning bond holds a few percentage points per person on average over a year.\nA variant of this and a lottery might have a slim chance of working for Bitcoin node holders. Their BTC address could be associated to their serial bond which is picked out at random on a weekly basis. Their bond number could be linked to their Bitnodes address / IP address, but held elsewhere to remove the link between the users IP and their Bitcoin address.\nThe extra effort to make this step would be desirable to make it easier for novices to host full nodes without having to change BTC addresses if they didn't know why they needed to do that when they first get started.\nWith an element of chance added, a full node might win the equivalent of a Block reward, or possibly smaller denominations which could be enough for people to consider their costs to own a full node as worth the bet.  Some weeks they might get enough to cover costs, some weeks they might make a small profit, some weeks they might hit the jackpot, but some weeks they might not get anything.\nThe problem is funding the incentives.\n* You could tell people to loan money as a bond which will be sent off as loans to traders via exchanges, generating 0.45% interest charges per day (apparently this goes on at these high borrowing levels), and that could generate the rewards for the network.\n* You could ask vendors to add a 0.001% full nodes tax to their sales to fund the incentives.\nIt's messy, but I might ponder on it a little more.\n", "author": "coins101 Legendary Offline Activity: 1442 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-04-30 15:31:42", "content": "The problem is funding the incentives.\nThe problem is identifying who really is a full node.
