Even if a hyperfast quantum PC gets invented its still reasonably safe to hold bitcoins this way.\nA bug could be, but i`m more worried of corrupt bitcoin core clients being downloaded , by somebody hijacking the bitcoin.org site.\nAlthough a stuff like that can easily be detected and people will be notified.\nMassive world wide exchange hacks, every exchange and online wallet provider.\nA coordinated global hack of all exchanges and online wallet providers is unlikely, since they have different security equipment, its like coordinated hack against all bank accounts. Bitcoin is not a political enemy, yet, so its not in the target for now.\nPeople loose interest and move on, no transaction = no fees, miners pull out, blockchain stops.\nThats silly, they wont lose interest, since constant innovation comes out every day.

Nobody left to ban it.\nRegulation is a concern now, but it isn't as bad as you would have imagined.

That's without bringing any kind of anonymity, privacy, fungibility or other *y terms into the debate.\nInitially I thought block size increase could alleviate that, but block size is already limited by propagation and the risk of orphans, so larger block size, even if allow, would likely remain oddities.\nIn terms of raw technological scaling, a single blockchain is just not scalable for widespread micro-transactions: it would already take 10 MB-sized blocks to handle Starbucks sales f.i. (2 billion $ annual revenue, $4 per sell, that's 10k tx every 10 minutes if I did the math right), and that's just Starbucks...\nThat also gives another angle for the \"how to reward full node operators?\" debate, as nodes (or lack of, as in centralization) have a role wrt propagation times.\n", "author": "fairglu Legendary Offline Activity: 1093 Merit: 1015 "}, {"date": "2015-09-21 22:25:16", "content": "I personally think the practical limit to block size is not the one in code, but the one derived from mining and propagation constraints.\nLarger blocks are slower to propagate, take more time to prepare, and have a greater chance of being orphaned.

It makes it all seem very clear to me that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Rumor has it that Bitcoin's original creator, the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto himself, collected the first one million Bitcoins for himself. This would leave a mere 20 million available to the rest of us. And current Bitcoin moguls The Winklevoss Twins have said that they own about 1% of all the bitcoins in existence, as of 2013. That may give you a window into how the bitcoin wealth tends to get distributed.\n99% of the Bitcoin Addresses have no Bitcoin Wealth\nThe table below is a snapshot of where the Bitcoin community, based upon all of the bitcoin addresses ever created, is when seen through the distribution of total bitcoin wealth. That it is so precise about the overall wallet content of Bitcoin community is somewhat startling, but a publicly distributed digital ledger should do that fairly well, I reckon. Anyway, this economic community photograph comes from around March 31st of 2015. That was when the amount of Bitcoin was set to pass the 14 million mark, which is exactly 2/3 of all of the bitcoins that will ever be created.\nbitcoin wealth\nAs you can see, this shows how top-heavy the Bitcoin community is. First, there are a lot of bitcoin addresses that are either dead, abandoned or lost due to forgetting passwords/keys/usernames/, etc. Or just tens of millions of test addresses that are empty and never were destined to hold bitcoin, just to exist. Almost 99% of all the bitcoin addresses have less than one-tenth of a bitcoin, which is less than $24 USD worth at present. This is pretty startling to see if you aren't expecting it. It is hard to compare to any other store of value easily or fairly since most do not have a finite unit count built-in.\nAlso read: Vaultoro Opens Swiss Gold Vaults to Bitcoiners\nThe U.S. Government has no problem making trillions of brand new U.S. Dollars every year since the inflation is spread throughout the global economy. Being the \"global reserve currency\" certainly has its advantages, mainly you have an unlimited credit card the rest of the world's economies help you pay off every day. Exporting inflation is so sweet! Should anything that has lost over 98% of its value over the last century be considered a \"store of value?\" Gold also does not have a finite limit in its mining, and there are several mining operations worldwide working on producing more 24 hours a day, seven days a week. How much gold there is also is unknown. So how much concern there should be about such an imbalance is questionable.\nFunny thing is this table also may help debunk the rumor of Nakamoto holding 1 million Bitcoins. The three addresses at the top of the Bitcoin address mountain have less than half of a million BTC held. Therefore, he would have to spread that large cache across several addresses, which may or may not be the case. This at least makes the rumor slightly less likely, but we may never know.\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\nBitcoin hoarding is common since many believe Bitcoin value is only a fraction of what it will be in future years, as production slows and demand increases over time. The amount of Bitcoin out there versus the amount of daily transactions of BTC shows this fairly clearly. The mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin has been slow if still progressing steadily. These numbers may indeed change greatly as more fiat currencies crumble under the weight of their own debt, more merchants integrate with Bitcoin, and its convenience improves in the marketplace.\nThe lack of Bitcoin funds issue is not an Australian problem, as I've reported before. Australia's bitcoin market is so strong that every Australian, numbering almost 25 million strong, could have $15 in bitcoin if the market were spread throughout the citizenry. The people in Australia, who are into bitcoin, aren't just giving lip service to it. They are putting their money where their mouth is. The rest of us need to look in the mirror on this one.\nAre Satoshi Nakamoto and The Winklevoss Twins the three addresses at the top of the Bitcoin wealth mountain? Will the next bull market change these numbers dramatically? Will the Bitcoin community experience a trickle-down economic windfall down the road when the heavy hitters have hoarded enough of a profit for being early adopters, and sell off their fortunes? Stay tuned.\nI don't know what to make of it, but I hope the future has a less centralized collection of wealth for the world's leading centralized digital currency.

Hopefully if we reach an achievable/realistic target of 10,000 USD per bitcoin then 100,000 USD is going to do a lot for you.

No one is talking about the positive side of the bitcoins and people also entertain bad news more then the good news.\n", "author": "hunnaryb Hero Member Offline Activity: 507 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-07-23 13:39:37", "content": "Most Average Joe's don't understand the workings of theÂ  engine of the car they drive or the internal workings of the transistors in the electronic gadgets they use.

Feel free to re-use or re-publish with attribution. -mrh]\nCourt documents filed on September 15 in a federal court in Atlanta, GA have revealed that Atlanta-based BitPay, Inc. was hacked to the tune of 5,000 bitcoins (approximately $1.8 million) in December of 2014.\nAs a major financial services provider in the Bitcoin marketplace, BitPay is an extremely obvious target for hackers. Of course, BitPay relies on an insurer, Massachusetts Bay Insurance Company, for instances of hacks and this court case involves the insurer refusing to pay on a policy involving hacks and fraudulent activity.\nA copy of the lawsuit is available here [PDF] and further documents submitted by BitPay are available here [PDF].\nBitPay: Bitcoins stolen were obtained by fraud\nAccording to the Atlanta Business Chronicle, the court documents reveal that the hacker first compromised the e-mail account of Bryan Krohn, BitPay's chief financial officer via a technique known as spear phishing. This technique targets a specific individual and directs them to a web page that looks legitimate, but is really controlled by the hacker. When the targeted individual enters the credentials into that page the hacker then gets their login information.\nTo get Krohn's credentials the hacker used access to the e-mail account of David Bailey, the founder of yBitcoin (a property of BTC Media Inc.), a print and digital media guide of the Bitcoin ecosystem, who had been in negotiation with BitPay over a Bitcoin-related magazine purchase. As for the phishing web page, the hacker crafted a Google document that appeared to be from Bailey to Krohn that acted to steal KrohnÂ’s corporate account credentials and give the hacker access.\nAccording to court documents, the hacker used this access to review KrohnÂ’s e-mail history and learn how BitPay transacted business. Using this knowledge and access to KrohnÂ’s account, the hacker then began to masquerade as Krohn.\nUsing this subterfuge, the hacker first e-mailed BitPayÂ’s CEO Stephen Pair and asked for 1,000 BTC to be transferred to a wallet claimed to belong to SecondMarket, Inc. vice president Preston Blankenship, which he did. Shortly thereafter another e-mail was sent for another 1,000 BTC, also transferred.\nThe next day, the imposter grew braver and asked for 3,000 BTC to be transferred to the customerÂ’s wallet. This time, the CEO e-mailed Krohn to verify the transfer, but the hacker had control of that e-mail account so simply replied that the request was valid.\nThe scam, however, was uncovered at this point because Pair had copied the real e-mail of a SecondMarket representative in the e-mail asking for verification. This led to a reply stating that SecondMarket had not bought 3,000 BTC.\nOf course, by this time all 3,000 bitcoins had been spirited away.\nThe lawsuit emerges\nBitPay attempted to get Massachusetts Bay Insurance Company, BitPayÂ’s insurer, to pay $950,000 of the total, but in June the insurer declined to pay. The resulting court documents that this information has been peeled from is the result of BitPayÂ’s lawsuit.\nThe refusal by the insurer to pay out appears to be regarding the nature of the hack:\nÂ“The facts as presented do not support a direct loss since there was not a hacking or unauthorized entry into Bitpay's computer system fraudulently causing a transfer of Money. Instead, the computer system of David Bailey, Bitpay's business partner, was compromised resulting in fictitious emails being received by Bitpay. The Policy does not afford coverage for indirect losses caused by a hacking into the computer system of someone other than the insured.Â”\nThat the insurance only covers what would be considered hack by electronic compromise, and not the significant portion of modern hacking, which is Â“social engineering,Â” makes this a strange insurance policy.\nFeatured image credit: photo via Charis Tsevis\nDiscuss!

Even if a hyperfast quantum PC gets invented its still reasonably safe to hold bitcoins this way.\nA bug could be, but i`m more worried of corrupt bitcoin core clients being downloaded , by somebody hijacking the bitcoin.org site.\nAlthough a stuff like that can easily be detected and people will be notified.\nMassive world wide exchange hacks, every exchange and online wallet provider.\nA coordinated global hack of all exchanges and online wallet providers is unlikely, since they have different security equipment, its like coordinated hack against all bank accounts. Bitcoin is not a political enemy, yet, so its not in the target for now.\nPeople loose interest and move on, no transaction = no fees, miners pull out, blockchain stops.\nThats silly, they wont lose interest, since constant innovation comes out every day. Plus they are invested in it, its like saying you leave 1000$ in a box, then you lose interest and never take it out from there...\nMost crypto investers wiill just move to another coin i think.\nSaying this i still don't think bitcoin will die anytime soon.\nThe only risk I can think of, which is the biggest risk is either:\nOutright ban in the major hubs -It will shrink bitcoin back to small price and send it to the black markets\nMassive regulation &amp; taxation worldwide - It will slow down progress, but it wont stop it\nBitcoin 2.0 comes along with totally anonymous transactions &amp; better security (1024 or 2048 bit protection) - Monero,DASH, and others are pretty big competitors and one day could take over\nOut of these 3 bigger risks I highlighted the BITCOIN 2.0 is the biggest risk currently bitcoin has, innovation will destroy replace bitcoin eventually.\nI don't think outright ban will happen now, banks love it due to regulation arbitrage, politicians love it because they can get more ***political donations*** due to bitcoin's semi-anonymity. Nobody left to ban it.\nRegulation is a concern now, but it isn't as bad as you would have imagined. Yes Bitlicense has drawbacks but atleast it gives legitimacy to bitcoin, and maybe wallstreet will start respecting it.\nBe that 2 years or 50, who knows but I`d invest some in Monero now and find out later\n[/list]\n", "author": "RealBitcoin Hero Member Offline Activity: 854 Merit: 1000 JAYCE DESIGNS - http://bit.ly/1tmgIwK "}, {"date": "2015-08-09 07:37:38", "content": "\"Monero,DASH, and others are pretty big competitors and one day could take over\"\nthey are only big competitors in your phantasy\n", "author": "LiteCoinGuy Legendary Offline Activity: 1148 Merit: 1001 In Satoshi I Trust "}, {"date": "2015-08-09 07:40:32", "content": "As unlikely as it may be, Bitcoin could effectively die.

In the case of the later, then your logic would fail as high fees on micro transactions, or even a regular transaction would make the system prohibitive and not any better than ViSA and cohorts.

That's without bringing any kind of anonymity, privacy, fungibility or other *y terms into the debate.\nInitially I thought block size increase could alleviate that, but block size is already limited by propagation and the risk of orphans, so larger block size, even if allow, would likely remain oddities.\nIn terms of raw technological scaling, a single blockchain is just not scalable for widespread micro-transactions: it would already take 10 MB-sized blocks to handle Starbucks sales f.i. (2 billion $ annual revenue, $4 per sell, that's 10k tx every 10 minutes if I did the math right), and that's just Starbucks...\nThat also gives another angle for the \"how to reward full node operators?\" debate, as nodes (or lack of, as in centralization) have a role wrt propagation times.\n", "author": "fairglu Legendary Offline Activity: 1093 Merit: 1015 "}, {"date": "2015-09-21 22:25:16", "content": "I personally think the practical limit to block size is not the one in code, but the one derived from mining and propagation constraints.\nLarger blocks are slower to propagate, take more time to prepare, and have a greater chance of being orphaned.

I mean we already see enough 1 transaction blocks. But it is not an issue at all. There is matt's relay network which makes it possible to propagate a full 1mb block in, i believe, 2 seconds so that it gets &gt;50%. Risk of orphaning banned.\nIn fact it should happen very seldom anyway when you think about that one block is found every 10 minutes only.\nAt the end you can't restrict the amount of allowed restrictions and await that bitcoin can survive with it.

Â My favourite is currently AirBitz on both iOS and Android because its easy to use, feels very secure, and it has good ways of authorising new devices (i use multiple mobile devices). Â it claims some easy to use two factor auth as well. Â of all the wallets I've tried on mobiles recently, this one seems to have the most going for it.\n3. Â for offline wallets I'm a big fan of the Trezor, and so far the only wallet software I've seen that lets you use the Trezor in a mobile environment is Mycelium (at least on Android), so thats a big vote for mycelium.\n4. Â Ledger Wallet is doing some very interesting work on mobile wallets.. i especially like the effort they're doing on trustlets. Â  Their beta of the wallet that runs in the trusted platform (trustonics) looks very interesting.

It makes it all seem very clear to me that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Rumor has it that Bitcoin's original creator, the legendary Satoshi Nakamoto himself, collected the first one million Bitcoins for himself. This would leave a mere 20 million available to the rest of us. And current Bitcoin moguls The Winklevoss Twins have said that they own about 1% of all the bitcoins in existence, as of 2013. That may give you a window into how the bitcoin wealth tends to get distributed.\n99% of the Bitcoin Addresses have no Bitcoin Wealth\nThe table below is a snapshot of where the Bitcoin community, based upon all of the bitcoin addresses ever created, is when seen through the distribution of total bitcoin wealth. That it is so precise about the overall wallet content of Bitcoin community is somewhat startling, but a publicly distributed digital ledger should do that fairly well, I reckon. Anyway, this economic community photograph comes from around March 31st of 2015. That was when the amount of Bitcoin was set to pass the 14 million mark, which is exactly 2/3 of all of the bitcoins that will ever be created.\nbitcoin wealth\nAs you can see, this shows how top-heavy the Bitcoin community is. First, there are a lot of bitcoin addresses that are either dead, abandoned or lost due to forgetting passwords/keys/usernames/, etc. Or just tens of millions of test addresses that are empty and never were destined to hold bitcoin, just to exist. Almost 99% of all the bitcoin addresses have less than one-tenth of a bitcoin, which is less than $24 USD worth at present. This is pretty startling to see if you aren't expecting it. It is hard to compare to any other store of value easily or fairly since most do not have a finite unit count built-in.\nAlso read: Vaultoro Opens Swiss Gold Vaults to Bitcoiners\nThe U.S. Government has no problem making trillions of brand new U.S. Dollars every year since the inflation is spread throughout the global economy. Being the \"global reserve currency\" certainly has its advantages, mainly you have an unlimited credit card the rest of the world's economies help you pay off every day. Exporting inflation is so sweet! Should anything that has lost over 98% of its value over the last century be considered a \"store of value?\" Gold also does not have a finite limit in its mining, and there are several mining operations worldwide working on producing more 24 hours a day, seven days a week. How much gold there is also is unknown. So how much concern there should be about such an imbalance is questionable.\nFunny thing is this table also may help debunk the rumor of Nakamoto holding 1 million Bitcoins. The three addresses at the top of the Bitcoin address mountain have less than half of a million BTC held. Therefore, he would have to spread that large cache across several addresses, which may or may not be the case. This at least makes the rumor slightly less likely, but we may never know.\n[divider]CCN[/divider]\nBitcoin hoarding is common since many believe Bitcoin value is only a fraction of what it will be in future years, as production slows and demand increases over time. The amount of Bitcoin out there versus the amount of daily transactions of BTC shows this fairly clearly. The mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin has been slow if still progressing steadily. These numbers may indeed change greatly as more fiat currencies crumble under the weight of their own debt, more merchants integrate with Bitcoin, and its convenience improves in the marketplace.\nThe lack of Bitcoin funds issue is not an Australian problem, as I've reported before. Australia's bitcoin market is so strong that every Australian, numbering almost 25 million strong, could have $15 in bitcoin if the market were spread throughout the citizenry. The people in Australia, who are into bitcoin, aren't just giving lip service to it. They are putting their money where their mouth is. The rest of us need to look in the mirror on this one.\nAre Satoshi Nakamoto and The Winklevoss Twins the three addresses at the top of the Bitcoin wealth mountain? Will the next bull market change these numbers dramatically? Will the Bitcoin community experience a trickle-down economic windfall down the road when the heavy hitters have hoarded enough of a profit for being early adopters, and sell off their fortunes? Stay tuned.\nI don't know what to make of it, but I hope the future has a less centralized collection of wealth for the world's leading centralized digital currency.

Â I think people are fearful of bitcoin because of silkroad and the like. Â Merchants without proper knowledge feel trading goods for\nBTC\nwould be like trading goods for pot or heroin. Â The don't get how on one hand\nBTC\nis fungible, but on the other hand it is not. Â One of the travesties of silk road is that Ross got charged for using coin that someone else got from nefarious means. Â Two hop guilt by association of associates. Â Larger companies fear regulation and how\nBTC\nfits into it. Â In the states, figuring out how to report business revenue is hard enough when reporting it in US dollars. Â I think there is much fear from buisness on what new regulation will snap into place at any minute requiring them to do something silly like take a picture of any customer paying with\nBTC\n(2)\nVolitility\n: If they pay expenses in $$ but get income in\nBTC\nthere is always a spread (either good or bad) that they have to account for. Â Bitpay and other services that can convert instantly to $$ mitigate some of that risk, but it still causes grief for retailers. Â If on the other hand companies could pay thier expenses in\nBTC\n, then I think you would see instant adoption globally. Â If there was no need to convert to $$ to pay the electric bill or rent, no one in their right mind would.\n", "author": "d4n13 Full Member Offline Activity: 210 Merit: 101 Â“Create Your Decentralized LifeÂ” "}, {"date": "2015-07-17 22:45:49", "content": "Hey guys,\nIt's been dawning on me for some time that there is one thing that businesses must hate.. credit card fees.

Â There is huge market opportunity for billion dollar investors to make winfalls in bitcoin based industry, but the investors are very slow to enter this market because so many early adopters are getting thrown in jail. Â The regulatory burden is overwhelming. Â This is made even worse in the areas that are not regulated. Â The unregulated areas could land investors in jail for any number of out dated backward laws dating back to the steam engine.\nI would like to think that the US would eventually break out ahead of the pack, but I'm not totally convinced. Â I think that major adoption will follow when some country gets serious about allowing it's citizens the freedom to develop bitcoin based industry without looking over their shoulder.\nYou are right, the U.S policies around finances and the transfer of finances around the world are draconian now. Since 9/11, as a few in banking have told me.Â  And if the other institutions/businesses don't play by U.S rules, then they can't play the dollar/US economy game.\nThis is why you see many exchanges either US-centric or non-available to US citizens, but rarely both at the same time. It's the US that has put itself in this boat and right about now, the rest of the world has quite possibly got real tired of it.\nThis has worked for the U.S for as long as the US dollar is the worlds reserve currency and the US had a strong economy of happy spenders that other countries could profit off of. But when the US dollar falls off the reserve currency horse, which it's already doing in view of oil, then the whole thing falls and the US will get left behind. That's what's unfortunate. The US is generally at the forefront of technological developments, but not this time really.

So with this in mind why is mainstream adoption taking so long! We're not saying invalidate fiat currency and only accept BTC or Alt-coin but businesses don't seem to want to touch it?\nWhat do you guys think the real issue is? Education among consumers and businesses? Volatile BTC price?\nTully\nThere are fees with bitcoin too but that aspect of bitcoin still favors bitcoin when compared to credit card fees.Â  Still though, to the average user, .0001 is too much of a transaction fee for too many average transactions.Â  People really need to be more careful with the fees in bitcoin.Â  I don't think it should ever be a percentage like it is with credit cards and I think that 10,000 satoshi should be respected as WAY too much of a transaction fee.Â  Such a large fee discredits the value of bitcoins.\nOther than the fees, the user experience is hugely problematic.Â  Nerds and geeks who eat/sleep/breath tech will tell you all is just fine but don't listen to them because they only speak for themselves and NOT for mass adoption of bitcoin.Â  Improve the user experience and bitcoin can be valuable and it has to happen sooner than later or else some other commercial enterprise will just issue the equivalent of wooden nickels and further discredit alternate currencies.\nOf course then there are plenty of people who could care less about mainstream adoption and would be fine with it staying as it is now or even going further underground.\n", "author": "grendel25 Legendary Offline Activity: 1246 Merit: 1023 "}, {"date": "2015-08-08 20:39:46", "content": "Paretos law says we only need the 20% to understand bitcoin.

Feel free to re-use or re-publish with attribution. -mrh]\nCourt documents filed on September 15 in a federal court in Atlanta, GA have revealed that Atlanta-based BitPay, Inc. was hacked to the tune of 5,000 bitcoins (approximately $1.8 million) in December of 2014.\nAs a major financial services provider in the Bitcoin marketplace, BitPay is an extremely obvious target for hackers. Of course, BitPay relies on an insurer, Massachusetts Bay Insurance Company, for instances of hacks and this court case involves the insurer refusing to pay on a policy involving hacks and fraudulent activity.\nA copy of the lawsuit is available here [PDF] and further documents submitted by BitPay are available here [PDF].\nBitPay: Bitcoins stolen were obtained by fraud\nAccording to the Atlanta Business Chronicle, the court documents reveal that the hacker first compromised the e-mail account of Bryan Krohn, BitPay's chief financial officer via a technique known as spear phishing. This technique targets a specific individual and directs them to a web page that looks legitimate, but is really controlled by the hacker. When the targeted individual enters the credentials into that page the hacker then gets their login information.\nTo get Krohn's credentials the hacker used access to the e-mail account of David Bailey, the founder of yBitcoin (a property of BTC Media Inc.), a print and digital media guide of the Bitcoin ecosystem, who had been in negotiation with BitPay over a Bitcoin-related magazine purchase. As for the phishing web page, the hacker crafted a Google document that appeared to be from Bailey to Krohn that acted to steal KrohnÂ’s corporate account credentials and give the hacker access.\nAccording to court documents, the hacker used this access to review KrohnÂ’s e-mail history and learn how BitPay transacted business. Using this knowledge and access to KrohnÂ’s account, the hacker then began to masquerade as Krohn.\nUsing this subterfuge, the hacker first e-mailed BitPayÂ’s CEO Stephen Pair and asked for 1,000 BTC to be transferred to a wallet claimed to belong to SecondMarket, Inc. vice president Preston Blankenship, which he did. Shortly thereafter another e-mail was sent for another 1,000 BTC, also transferred.\nThe next day, the imposter grew braver and asked for 3,000 BTC to be transferred to the customerÂ’s wallet. This time, the CEO e-mailed Krohn to verify the transfer, but the hacker had control of that e-mail account so simply replied that the request was valid.\nThe scam, however, was uncovered at this point because Pair had copied the real e-mail of a SecondMarket representative in the e-mail asking for verification. This led to a reply stating that SecondMarket had not bought 3,000 BTC.\nOf course, by this time all 3,000 bitcoins had been spirited away.\nThe lawsuit emerges\nBitPay attempted to get Massachusetts Bay Insurance Company, BitPayÂ’s insurer, to pay $950,000 of the total, but in June the insurer declined to pay. The resulting court documents that this information has been peeled from is the result of BitPayÂ’s lawsuit.\nThe refusal by the insurer to pay out appears to be regarding the nature of the hack:\nÂ“The facts as presented do not support a direct loss since there was not a hacking or unauthorized entry into Bitpay's computer system fraudulently causing a transfer of Money. Instead, the computer system of David Bailey, Bitpay's business partner, was compromised resulting in fictitious emails being received by Bitpay. The Policy does not afford coverage for indirect losses caused by a hacking into the computer system of someone other than the insured.Â”\nThat the insurance only covers what would be considered hack by electronic compromise, and not the significant portion of modern hacking, which is Â“social engineering,Â” makes this a strange insurance policy.\nFeatured image credit: photo via Charis Tsevis\nDiscuss!
