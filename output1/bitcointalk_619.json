If it can't get easier, i doubt it will ever be popular. I just can't imagine some of my friends (or family) understanding how to get, store or spend bitcoins...

Furthermore in regards to the vision of Satoshi, he was a greater big blocks proponent compared to most of us.\nWhile I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall. Â If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time. Â Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms. Â Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. Â I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.\nLong before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section Cool to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Â Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. Â At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.\nThe eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets.\nBut for now, while itÂs still small, itÂs nice to keep it small so new users can get going faster. When I eventually implement client-only mode, that wonÂt matter much anymore.\nThe current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users.\nIt can be phased in, like:\nif (blocknumber &gt; 115000)\nmaxblocksize = largerlimit\nIt can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.\nWhen we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.\nThe threshold can easily be changed in the future. Â We can decide to increase it when the time comes. Â It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed. Â If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use. Â Keeping the threshold lower would help limit the amount of wasted disk space in that event.\nBitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.\n", "author": "VeritasSapere Hero Member Offline Activity: 546 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-12-25 15:06:33", "content": "Jeff Garzik has also recently very clearly stated why the path that Core is presently taking is the wrong path for Bitcoin:\nAn Economic Change Event is a period of market chaos, where large changes to prices and sets of economic actors occurs over a short time period. A Fee Event is a notable Economic Change Event, where a realistic projection forsees higher fee/KB on average, pricing some economic actors (bitcoin projects and businesses) out of the system.\nThe game theory bidding behavior is different for a mostly-empty resource versus a usually-full resource. Â Prices are different. Â Profitable business models are different. Â Users (the set of economic actors on the network) are different.\nFailure to increase block size is not obviously-conservative, it is a conscious choice, electing for one economic state and set of actors and prices over another. Choosing Future Fee Market over Today's Fee Market. It is rational to reason that maintaining TFM is more conservative than enduring an Economic Change Event from TFM to FFM. It is rational to reason that maintaining similar prices and economic actors is less disruptive. Failure to increase block size will lead to a Fee Event sooner rather than later. Failure to plan ahead for a Fee Event will lead to greater market chaos and User pain.\nSome Developers wish to accelerate the Fee Event, and a veto can accomplish that. In the current developer dynamics, 1-2 key developers can and very likely would veto any block size increase.\nThis is an extreme moral hazard: A few Bitcoin Core committers can veto increase and thereby reshape bitcoin economics, price some businesses out of the system. It is less of a moral hazard to keep the current economics [by raising block size] and not exercise such power.\nThe current trajectory of no-block-size-increase can lead to short time market chaos, actor chaos, businesses no longer viable. In a $6.6B economy, it is criminal to let the Service undergo an Economic Change event without warning users loudly, months in advance: Â \"Dear users, ECE has accelerated potential due to developers preferring a transition from TFM to FFM.\"\nFurther, wallet software User experience is very, very poor in a hyper-competitive fee market.\nAlmost all bitcoin businesses, exchanges and miners have stated they want a block size increase. Â See the many media articles, BIP 101 letter, and wiki.\nIt is a valid and rational economic choice to subsidize the system with lower fees in the beginning. Many miners, for example, openly state they prefer long term system growth over maximizing tiny amounts of current day income. Vetoing a block size increase has the effect of eliminating that economic choice as an option.\nWithout exaggeration, I have never seen this much disconnect between user wishes and dev outcomes in 20+ years of open source.\nHigher Service prices can negatively impact system security. Bitcoin depends on a virtuous cycle of users boosting and maintaining bitcoin's network effect, incentivizing miners, increasing security. Higher prices that reduce bitcoin's user count and network effect can have the opposite impact.\nWe only know for certain that blocks-mostly-not-full works. We do not know that changing to blocks-mostly-full works. Changing to a new economic system includes boatloads of risk.\nThe worst possible outcome is letting the ecosystem randomly drift into the first Fee Event without openly stating the new economic policy choices and consequences. The simple fact is *inaction* on this supply-limited resource, block size, will change bitcoin to a new economic shape and with different economic actors, selecting some and not others. It is better to kick the can and gather crucial field data, because next-step (FFM) is very much not fleshed out.\nhttp://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011973.html\n", "author": "VeritasSapere Hero Member Offline Activity: 546 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-12-25 15:26:39", "content": "This matter has not been settled at all.

Core has made its position rather clear, it is diverting from the original vision of Satoshi. If Core got its way they would block the stream of transactions in favor of off chain solutions. There is presently massive opposition to this move by Core and I suspect that we will see an industry or user led fork rectifying this situation soon.\nThis is a test of the governance mechanism within Bitcoin. Core should not decide on the future of Bitcoin for all of us. Bitcoin should not rely on a centralized authority in the form of Core to make decisions for us, the market or the economic majority should rule Bitcoin instead, this is best reflected through having multiple alternative implementations to choose from. Since an election with only one choice would be the equivalent to totalitarianism after all. Fortunately we do now have three alternative implementations which will increase the blocksize. BitcoinXT, Btcd and Bitcoin Unlimited.\nThere is no governance mechanism, everyone is free to start their own implementations like BitcoinXT and then turn it into the official Bitcoin with enough support, but people don't care about it and that's why it's got no nodes running, people is free run nodes for that or not.\nWhat you are describing is the governance mechanism of Bitcoin, that you do not recognize this does not change the fact that there is a governance mechanism in Bitcoin, after all important decisions do still need to be made, and I would not consider all decision making power being concentrated in Core to be a good governance model.\nYou are arguing a straw man in regards to BitcoinXT, most people in the developed world will still be able to run full nodes in their homes under the schedule outlined in BIP101. Furthermore in regards to the vision of Satoshi, he was a greater big blocks proponent compared to most of us.\nIm from the developed world and running a node is a pain in the ass already. Luckily the new version will make it boot faster. In any case, the number of nodes now is already low enough, you don't want to worsen it. More nodes run by different people = more decentralized Bitcoin, I don't need to read a million Satoshi quotes to realize this fact.\nYou are oversimplifying this issue, node count is not the only important metric in Bitcoin, node count is also effected by adoption and allowing the blocks to fill up rendering transactions unreliable and much more expensive will not be good for adoption over the long run.\nI also question the idea of people running full nodes for the banks, payment processors and other large institutions when they can not effectively use Bitcoin themselves because they will have been priced out of the network by these larger institutions that normal people can not compete with. I do not believe we would even reach that point in the first place however since for these large institutions to use Bitcoin there will need to be mass adoption first otherwise it would make more sense for them to build their own systems or just make use of a cheaper, faster and better alternatives that will exist. Essentially what I am saying is that Bitcoin can not become a world reserve currency or a global settlement network without mass adoption from the people first, and that this can not happen with a limited blocksize, since Bitcoin will simply just be out competed, this is basic economics.\nAgain, a fee market does not fix this,\na fee market simply priorities who is able to use Bitcoin and who is not able to use Bitcoin.\nThere are losers in a fee market that become priced out.\nBitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.\nThe full quote sounds like he is saying the opposite\nPiling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale. Bitcoin and BitDNS can be used separately. Users shouldn't have to download all of both to use one or the other.

BitDNS users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few domain registrars are needed, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.\nHe is basically saying that putting everything into the blockchain doesn't scale.. so we need LN. You dont need to be very smart to know that without LN and by raising block size only we will never scale to global levels doing it all on the blockchain, not without node farms which is a no-no.\nHe is not saying this at all and you are cherry picking this statement in order to falsely imply that Satoshi did not support big blocks when clearly he does. I even agree with his statement here, we can not put all data into the Bitcoin blockchain, this is why we have projects like SJCX and Maidsafe. This is very different compared to blocking the stream of transactions in Bitcoin however because some people believe that Bitcoin is not money and have a radically different vision for Bitcoin. Satoshi did however think that Bitcoin is money and that therefore transactions should be cheap, at least for the first few decades at least.\nBitcoin can scale, this false meme that Bitcoin can not scale is perpetuated by engineers who seem to be stuck in the nirvana fallacy that Bitcoin can not scale because it does not scale efficiently, this is wrong and even a modest blocksize increase can make a huge difference in terms of adoption and the throughput of the Bitcoin blockchain.\nDo not be lead astray by the people attempting to convince us that Bitcoin is broken and that they need to fix it. Bitcoin works just fine and we should continue with this experiment and let it run its course.\nDisagreements appear rooted more in differing opinions on economics, a specialized field entirely distinct from engineering, programming, and network design.\nThe block size limit has for the most part not ever been, and should not now be, used to determine the actual size of average blocks under normal network operating conditions. Real average block size ought to emerge from factors of supply and demand for what I will term Âtransaction-inclusion services.Â Beginning to use the protocol block size limit to restrict the provision of transaction-inclusion services would be a radical change to Bitcoin. The burden of proof is therefore on persons advocating using the protocol limit in this novel way.\nThe idea of using the limit in this new wayÂnot the idea of raising it now by some degree to keep it from beginning to interfere with normal operationsÂis what constitutes an attempt to change something important about the Bitcoin protocol. And there rests the burden of proof.\nTransaction-fee levels are not in any general need of being artificially pushed upward. A 130-year transition phase was planned into Bitcoin during which the full transition from block reward revenue to transaction-fee revenue was to take place.\nThe protocol block size limit was added as a temporary anti-spam measure, not a technocratic market-manipulation measure.\n", "author": "VeritasSapere Hero Member Offline Activity: 546 Merit: 500 "}], "date": "2015-12-22 00:48:09"}, {"content": "https://chrispacia.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/lightning-network-skepticism/\nI like the idea of the lightning network. I think the developers behind it are very smart and itÂs a very clever use of Bitcoin contracts. IÂm sure that whatever comes from it will be useful to some parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem at a minimum. What IÂm not for, however, is prematurely deprecating critical parts of bitcoin (zeroconf transactions and low transaction fees) when itÂs not yet clear that the lightning network will be a viable replacement for them. Yet thatÂs what the core developers seems bent on doing.\nWe know that lightning is at least technically feasible. We donÂt know if itÂs economically feasible or even a desirable alternative. Will it be a decentralized peer-to-peer payment layer or will it end up as a quasi-centralized payment network similar modern banking? We donÂt know the answer to this question and probably wont know until we see it in action. Which is why it comes across as irresponsible to go Âall-inÂ on lightning at this point.\nMy main concern from the beginning was that, as a hub-and-spoke payment layer, there would be very few hubs and the network would be quasi-centralized and a regulatory sitting duck. It seems I wasnÂt the only one with this concern as thereÂs been a fairly recent pivot away from the hub-and-spoke network topology to a more organic, wallet-to-wallet routing. The network is now envisioned as a more pure p2p payment layer without those large scale payment hubs.\nCertainly this has to be viewed as a promising development as it begins to address my primary concern. Unfortunately, I find this view of the lightning network overly optimistic. In what follows I will give a lightning network overview and some reasons why I think itÂs likely the network will end up with the hub-and-spoke topology anyway.\nContinue\nGreat article.\n", "views": 755, "author": "HostFat Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 2940 Merit: 1068 I support freedom of choice ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLightning Network Skepticism\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-12-24 07:32:13", "content": "firstly there is no such thing as quasi centralised... its either centralised (one point of failure) or decentralised.\nthere is however wildly distributed or confined distribution, which if the distribution of LN nodes is confined, it could possibly lead to collusion..\ni personally dont see it as a ripple thing.. where everyone needs to log into a ripple owned server. to then trade with coinbase or bitstamp\ni see it as a standalone executable that anyone can have. but where most of the big players such as bitpay, coinbase, etc will be the main channel operators, purely due to popularity of moving funds in and out of their services.\nand as long as this executable still uses the same signature method and proof of value to ensure even they cant fiddle with other peoples funds then its all good.\nif it turns out to just be a sql database saying | user1=0.1btc | user2=0.09btc | where the channel operator can fiddle.. then it should not be part of the bitcoin ecosystem\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Offline Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2015-12-24 08:19:32", "content": "firstly there is no such thing as quasi centralised... its either centralised (one point of failure) or decentralised.\nThe same is valid also for bitcoin with larger blocks.

But if we aren't early adopters anymore, then it means that the boom has already happened (and failed) and that bitcoin is a failure too, which I hope is not your expectation, people. Of course there was the big krash at the beginning of 2014 but bitcoin survived it, and it even helped bitcoin become stronger. Only thing it did was to delay its success (provided it is indeed destined to succeed).\nAs for me I'm very optimistic as to the future of bitcoin but one shouldn't be in too much of a hurry: if the boom is to happen quickly when it happens, it doesn't mean that it has to happen tomorrow or even in the next ten years. Not being in a hurry is the key.\nSatoshi is not an early adopter btw, but an inventor, or at least a creator.

The firsts are they who after the first attraction begin to \"dig\" about those to learn more. Normally more understand more take form a based decision about the becoming more part or to leave those. Then are the second ones who want to try just for trying with the hope that maybe something can be from their effort. Without taking the effort to know more. Or to know only very few possible useful things related to their choice.\nHere are not classified the people who know everything of the new thing since the beginning or at least before the appearance on the public of that. They become part of those because have big hopes that their chooses will bring almost for sure benefits. They know all and cannot be named as early adopters. As for me, to adopt something mean that this thing is created (or is in its way of creation, or it is clearly ready to be made) and someone, knowing it in the just told ways and phases, make him interested about it.

These new type of transactions would be significantly smaller because they store the signature outside of the part that counts. The signature part would also be only counted as 25% of its actual size. Once SW is introduced properly (soft fork first, hard fork later) it would be easy to introduce new transaction types, by just adding a new prefix with a soft fork. This could e.g. make pay to script hash significantly smaller, because you could define the script as \"outside\" of the transaction and no longer counting towards the blocksize limit.\nIt essentially reduces a TX (or the part that is counted towards the blocklimit) to \"move coins from A to B\".\n", "author": "shorena Copper Member Legendary Offline Activity: 1470 Merit: 1259 No I dont escrow anymore.

Furthermore in regards to the vision of Satoshi, he was a greater big blocks proponent compared to most of us.\nWhile I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall. Â If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time. Â Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms. Â Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. Â I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.\nLong before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section Cool to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Â Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. Â At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.\nThe eventual solution will be to not care how big it gets.\nBut for now, while itÂs still small, itÂs nice to keep it small so new users can get going faster. When I eventually implement client-only mode, that wonÂt matter much anymore.\nThe current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users.\nIt can be phased in, like:\nif (blocknumber &gt; 115000)\nmaxblocksize = largerlimit\nIt can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.\nWhen we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.\nThe threshold can easily be changed in the future. Â We can decide to increase it when the time comes. Â It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed. Â If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use. Â Keeping the threshold lower would help limit the amount of wasted disk space in that event.\nBitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.\n", "author": "VeritasSapere Hero Member Offline Activity: 546 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-12-25 15:06:33", "content": "Jeff Garzik has also recently very clearly stated why the path that Core is presently taking is the wrong path for Bitcoin:\nAn Economic Change Event is a period of market chaos, where large changes to prices and sets of economic actors occurs over a short time period. A Fee Event is a notable Economic Change Event, where a realistic projection forsees higher fee/KB on average, pricing some economic actors (bitcoin projects and businesses) out of the system.\nThe game theory bidding behavior is different for a mostly-empty resource versus a usually-full resource. Â Prices are different. Â Profitable business models are different. Â Users (the set of economic actors on the network) are different.\nFailure to increase block size is not obviously-conservative, it is a conscious choice, electing for one economic state and set of actors and prices over another. Choosing Future Fee Market over Today's Fee Market. It is rational to reason that maintaining TFM is more conservative than enduring an Economic Change Event from TFM to FFM. It is rational to reason that maintaining similar prices and economic actors is less disruptive. Failure to increase block size will lead to a Fee Event sooner rather than later. Failure to plan ahead for a Fee Event will lead to greater market chaos and User pain.\nSome Developers wish to accelerate the Fee Event, and a veto can accomplish that. In the current developer dynamics, 1-2 key developers can and very likely would veto any block size increase.\nThis is an extreme moral hazard: A few Bitcoin Core committers can veto increase and thereby reshape bitcoin economics, price some businesses out of the system. It is less of a moral hazard to keep the current economics [by raising block size] and not exercise such power.\nThe current trajectory of no-block-size-increase can lead to short time market chaos, actor chaos, businesses no longer viable. In a $6.6B economy, it is criminal to let the Service undergo an Economic Change event without warning users loudly, months in advance: Â \"Dear users, ECE has accelerated potential due to developers preferring a transition from TFM to FFM.\"\nFurther, wallet software User experience is very, very poor in a hyper-competitive fee market.\nAlmost all bitcoin businesses, exchanges and miners have stated they want a block size increase. Â See the many media articles, BIP 101 letter, and wiki.\nIt is a valid and rational economic choice to subsidize the system with lower fees in the beginning. Many miners, for example, openly state they prefer long term system growth over maximizing tiny amounts of current day income. Vetoing a block size increase has the effect of eliminating that economic choice as an option.\nWithout exaggeration, I have never seen this much disconnect between user wishes and dev outcomes in 20+ years of open source.\nHigher Service prices can negatively impact system security. Bitcoin depends on a virtuous cycle of users boosting and maintaining bitcoin's network effect, incentivizing miners, increasing security. Higher prices that reduce bitcoin's user count and network effect can have the opposite impact.\nWe only know for certain that blocks-mostly-not-full works. We do not know that changing to blocks-mostly-full works. Changing to a new economic system includes boatloads of risk.\nThe worst possible outcome is letting the ecosystem randomly drift into the first Fee Event without openly stating the new economic policy choices and consequences. The simple fact is *inaction* on this supply-limited resource, block size, will change bitcoin to a new economic shape and with different economic actors, selecting some and not others. It is better to kick the can and gather crucial field data, because next-step (FFM) is very much not fleshed out.\nhttp://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011973.html\n", "author": "VeritasSapere Hero Member Offline Activity: 546 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-12-25 15:26:39", "content": "This matter has not been settled at all.

More nodes run by different people = more decentralized Bitcoin, I don't need to read a million Satoshi quotes to realize this fact.\nYou are oversimplifying this issue, node count is not the only important metric in Bitcoin, node count is also effected by adoption and allowing the blocks to fill up rendering transactions unreliable and much more expensive will not be good for adoption over the long run.\nI also question the idea of people running full nodes for the banks, payment processors and other large institutions when they can not effectively use Bitcoin themselves because they will have been priced out of the network by these larger institutions that normal people can not compete with. I do not believe we would even reach that point in the first place however since for these large institutions to use Bitcoin there will need to be mass adoption first otherwise it would make more sense for them to build their own systems or just make use of a cheaper, faster and better alternatives that will exist. Essentially what I am saying is that Bitcoin can not become a world reserve currency or a global settlement network without mass adoption from the people first, and that this can not happen with a limited blocksize, since Bitcoin will simply just be out competed, this is basic economics.\nAgain, a fee market does not fix this,\na fee market simply priorities who is able to use Bitcoin and who is not able to use Bitcoin.\nThere are losers in a fee market that become priced out.\nBitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.\nThe full quote sounds like he is saying the opposite\nPiling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale.

You dont need to be very smart to know that without LN and by raising block size only we will never scale to global levels doing it all on the blockchain, not without node farms which is a no-no.\nHe is not saying this at all and you are cherry picking this statement in order to falsely imply that Satoshi did not support big blocks when clearly he does. I even agree with his statement here, we can not put all data into the Bitcoin blockchain, this is why we have projects like SJCX and Maidsafe. This is very different compared to blocking the stream of transactions in Bitcoin however because some people believe that Bitcoin is not money and have a radically different vision for Bitcoin. Satoshi did however think that Bitcoin is money and that therefore transactions should be cheap, at least for the first few decades at least.\nBitcoin can scale, this false meme that Bitcoin can not scale is perpetuated by engineers who seem to be stuck in the nirvana fallacy that Bitcoin can not scale because it does not scale efficiently, this is wrong and even a modest blocksize increase can make a huge difference in terms of adoption and the throughput of the Bitcoin blockchain.\nDo not be lead astray by the people attempting to convince us that Bitcoin is broken and that they need to fix it. Bitcoin works just fine and we should continue with this experiment and let it run its course.\nDisagreements appear rooted more in differing opinions on economics, a specialized field entirely distinct from engineering, programming, and network design.\nThe block size limit has for the most part not ever been, and should not now be, used to determine the actual size of average blocks under normal network operating conditions. Real average block size ought to emerge from factors of supply and demand for what I will term Âtransaction-inclusion services.Â Beginning to use the protocol block size limit to restrict the provision of transaction-inclusion services would be a radical change to Bitcoin. The burden of proof is therefore on persons advocating using the protocol limit in this novel way.\nThe idea of using the limit in this new wayÂnot the idea of raising it now by some degree to keep it from beginning to interfere with normal operationsÂis what constitutes an attempt to change something important about the Bitcoin protocol. And there rests the burden of proof.\nTransaction-fee levels are not in any general need of being artificially pushed upward. A 130-year transition phase was planned into Bitcoin during which the full transition from block reward revenue to transaction-fee revenue was to take place.\nThe protocol block size limit was added as a temporary anti-spam measure, not a technocratic market-manipulation measure.\n", "author": "VeritasSapere Hero Member Offline Activity: 546 Merit: 500 "}], "date": "2015-12-22 00:48:09"}, {"content": "https://chrispacia.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/lightning-network-skepticism/\nI like the idea of the lightning network. I think the developers behind it are very smart and itÂs a very clever use of Bitcoin contracts. IÂm sure that whatever comes from it will be useful to some parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem at a minimum. What IÂm not for, however, is prematurely deprecating critical parts of bitcoin (zeroconf transactions and low transaction fees) when itÂs not yet clear that the lightning network will be a viable replacement for them. Yet thatÂs what the core developers seems bent on doing.\nWe know that lightning is at least technically feasible. We donÂt know if itÂs economically feasible or even a desirable alternative. Will it be a decentralized peer-to-peer payment layer or will it end up as a quasi-centralized payment network similar modern banking? We donÂt know the answer to this question and probably wont know until we see it in action. Which is why it comes across as irresponsible to go Âall-inÂ on lightning at this point.\nMy main concern from the beginning was that, as a hub-and-spoke payment layer, there would be very few hubs and the network would be quasi-centralized and a regulatory sitting duck. It seems I wasnÂt the only one with this concern as thereÂs been a fairly recent pivot away from the hub-and-spoke network topology to a more organic, wallet-to-wallet routing. The network is now envisioned as a more pure p2p payment layer without those large scale payment hubs.\nCertainly this has to be viewed as a promising development as it begins to address my primary concern. Unfortunately, I find this view of the lightning network overly optimistic. In what follows I will give a lightning network overview and some reasons why I think itÂs likely the network will end up with the hub-and-spoke topology anyway.\nContinue\nGreat article.\n", "views": 755, "author": "HostFat Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 2940 Merit: 1068 I support freedom of choice ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLightning Network Skepticism\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-12-24 07:32:13", "content": "firstly there is no such thing as quasi centralised... its either centralised (one point of failure) or decentralised.\nthere is however wildly distributed or confined distribution, which if the distribution of LN nodes is confined, it could possibly lead to collusion..\ni personally dont see it as a ripple thing.. where everyone needs to log into a ripple owned server. to then trade with coinbase or bitstamp\ni see it as a standalone executable that anyone can have. but where most of the big players such as bitpay, coinbase, etc will be the main channel operators, purely due to popularity of moving funds in and out of their services.\nand as long as this executable still uses the same signature method and proof of value to ensure even they cant fiddle with other peoples funds then its all good.\nif it turns out to just be a sql database saying | user1=0.1btc | user2=0.09btc | where the channel operator can fiddle.. then it should not be part of the bitcoin ecosystem\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Offline Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2015-12-24 08:19:32", "content": "firstly there is no such thing as quasi centralised... its either centralised (one point of failure) or decentralised.\nThe same is valid also for bitcoin with larger blocks.

Because you don't believe in the project (or you don't understand it).\nMy thoughts exactly. Historically speaking innovations usually happened after one or a few pioneers designed something new. Then a latency phase happened and then it was the boom that made it broadly accepted and used.\nIf we are in the latency phase before the boom, then yes we are still early adopters and early miners should be called pioneers. But if we aren't early adopters anymore, then it means that the boom has already happened (and failed) and that bitcoin is a failure too, which I hope is not your expectation, people. Of course there was the big krash at the beginning of 2014 but bitcoin survived it, and it even helped bitcoin become stronger. Only thing it did was to delay its success (provided it is indeed destined to succeed).\nAs for me I'm very optimistic as to the future of bitcoin but one shouldn't be in too much of a hurry: if the boom is to happen quickly when it happens, it doesn't mean that it has to happen tomorrow or even in the next ten years. Not being in a hurry is the key.\nSatoshi is not an early adopter btw, but an inventor, or at least a creator.

The firsts are they who after the first attraction begin to \"dig\" about those to learn more. Normally more understand more take form a based decision about the becoming more part or to leave those. Then are the second ones who want to try just for trying with the hope that maybe something can be from their effort. Without taking the effort to know more. Or to know only very few possible useful things related to their choice.\nHere are not classified the people who know everything of the new thing since the beginning or at least before the appearance on the public of that. They become part of those because have big hopes that their chooses will bring almost for sure benefits. They know all and cannot be named as early adopters. As for me, to adopt something mean that this thing is created (or is in its way of creation, or it is clearly ready to be made) and someone, knowing it in the just told ways and phases, make him interested about it.

Then trading was halted and we all had to wait for it to restart, battle lines were drawn, the buyers vs the sellers. I'll never forget the action of those 24-48hrs.\nFor me that was the early adopter scene, we basically had gox + silk road and that was it. It was like being able to talk about the amateur scene before btc grew up, it was raw and a lot of fun.
