Hmm... It's not great. But they do have voting. Voting is useful. It has been misused to legitimize politics but voting can be very useful for a lot of clean purposes like determining the popular value of a blog post. So, Reddit has got this already. But there's something wrong with Reddit. It's not perfect. There are issues. I'm not a big fan. Let's have a look at Ethereum this morning. I wonder how things are going over there. I read some new status updates that indicate that the product will be released on schedule in March. Some of it alpha like Mist. hmm... Let's see. It is an interesting project but some parts of execution and presentation have not been great. If it's a success it will obviously have a big impact on the whole Bitcoin ecosystem. Imagine if we start switching Blockchains... Now that's a big switch, considering all the projects that are already built on top of Bitcoin. Counterparty is interesting too. I wonder if it would scale. It's a bit expensive to send tokens now. I have heard some indications that the cost might be reduced eventually. The Counterparty team wants to implement Ethereum. I wonder how that works technically speaking. Is the Bitcoin Blockchain adaptable enough for all this new technology that were not built yet 5 years ago? Is Krellenstein coding away? Or is the project growing so quickly that they are focusing more on buysiness growth now?\nThis morning someone had left fishbones on the street outside my house. Disgusting. But they formed a pattern. The pattern clearly said \"Gaze into the blockchain\". So I did. Hope those fishbones ain't telling lies. I had ants outside the house too. The ants were walking around in a pattern that reminded me of a waltz. Scurrying around the lawn. Hello little ants. Hello oh giant, they replied. The sea is full of anemones. Spacey looking things with lots of jelly arms. Various colors. Sitting on the ocean floor. In some rock or crevice. I wonder what they are thinking about. I sit on the cliffs. Sun dried. Looking down at the water below. Enjoying the weather. Thinking about nothing. The water is blue. Dark blue. I can jump right in. Look at the little fish. No jellyfish here. Nothing to worry about. Calm waters. The stars above. Far away. Yet the light reaches us. Far away places. Unfathomably far. Look, there's a jellyfish after all. Swooping around. Feeling the flow. Moving with the waves. In touch with the sea. Now think about a glass of water. Right there on the dining table. Not a single wave. Or are there? Tranquilent and utterly engulfable. Sweet water. Actually not sweet. But certainly not salt either. Think about the cell. The cells are freaking complex. At the same time they are full of water. They would not be operational without water. Water is a necessity for the organells to function. A universe in its own way. An unimaginably complex mechanism. Compare this to a simple battery. Just allowing electrons to move from one pole to the other. It is like comparing the stock market with a single transaction. Performing one simple function. Two states only, providing electricity and not doing so.\nLinks:\nOk, here are some links.\n#I am selling tokens (GITC). Blank tokens, no promises, no backing or anything.

After white-boarding a list of possible names for several weeks, we settled on Gemini for a host of reasons. Gemini is the Latin word for twins and as such, it inherently explores the concept of duality. We were drawn to this both because of the two worlds of money (old and new) that will intersect on the Gemini platform as well as the two-way nature of trade that it will facilitate. But thats not all. Once we picked our name, a fun fact emerged. We realized that NASAs Project Gemini was a spaceflight program focused on laying the groundwork for Apollos later mission to land man on the Moon. As such, it was coined (no pun intended) mans\nbridge to the moon\n. In this spirit, weve built Gemini to be your bridge to the future of money. Oh, and Tyler and I just happen to be identical twin brothers.\n\"You eat twice as much as the Winklevoss twins combines, hence I'm the only one in this room that NASA's capable of sending to the moon.

Bitcoin mentioned briefly.\nFeel free to comment.\nSource\nhttps://agenda.weforum.org/2015/01/the-second-crypto-war-and-the-future-of-the-internet/\nThe second Crypto War and the future of the internet\nIn the early 1990s, the first Crypto War began. With the release of Phil Zimmermans PGP in 1991, for the first time in history, anyone could encode and exchange a message that no law enforcement agency had the technical ability to intercept and decode.\nFearing that criminals would be able to hide their communications, the reaction of governments worldwide was swift. The United States, for instance, banned the export of what it deemed strong crypto. Early versions of Internet software such as Netscapes Communicator browser and Lotus Notes came in two flavors: a Domestic version that supported strong 128-bit crypto and an International version that supported weak 40-bit crypto.\nBut the genie was out of the bottle. The math equations that powered both strong and weak crypto systems were identical and elegantly simple. The difference between strong and weak was merely the length of the keys they used. Regulating the length of a key  effectively akin to telling you that youre not allowed to use a password thats more than a certain number of characters  proved impossible. And, by the early 2000s, the technologists prevailed. Restrictions on the use and export of strong cryptosystems were largely dropped, and the first Crypto War came to a close.\nFirst shots in the next Crypto War\nHistory may attribute the Archduke Ferdinand moment that spawned the second Crypto War to a cheeky little smiley face, hand drawn on a United States National Security Agency diagram which was revealed to the public on October 30, 2013. On that day, the\nWashington Post published\nthe diagram from the trove of secret documents revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\nSource:\nWashington Post\n, 30 October 2013\nThe document showed how the US was tapping Googles private communication lines over which messages between the companys data centers were being exchanged unencrypted. The cheeky smiley face denoted the place on Googles infrastructure where crypto was added and removed. To the NSA, it was a clever way to sneak behind the strong crypto lines and capture messages where they werent encoded. To the technology industry, it was nothing short of a declaration of war.\nThe technologists fight back\nSince then, the technologists have scrambled to add strong cryptographic protections even to those parts of their systems that were previously considered private. Apple, for instance, with the release of the latest version of the companys iPhone software, has designed a messaging system where it doesnt have a way of reading messages that pass between two users. If youre using an up-to-date iPhone to send a text message to another iPhone user, and the little bubble containing your message is blue, then neither Apple, nor your ISP, nor any law enforcement agency tapping into the transmission line is likely able to read the contents of the message.\nThis intentional blinding of user content not only thwarts mass surveillance, but also many of the techniques of targeted law enforcement. If Apple doesnt have the contents of their users messages, the company has no way of responding to a warrant requesting that content. Previously, companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and others have acted as a centralized repository of user data that law enforcement could turn to during an investigation. As the second Crypto War heats up, these companies are engineering new ways to lock their users data away even from legal process.\nAnd, again, as in the first Crypto War, the response from government has been swift. British Prime Minister David Cameron recently pledged that modern forms of communication should not be exempt from being listened to. Director of GCHQ Robert Hannigan urged that companies needed to help with allowing surveillance of their networks, describing social media networks as a terrorists command-and-control network of choice. And US FBI Director James Comey suggested companies should be required to design intercept solutions into their technologies.\nCryptographys broad swath\nWhile debate in the coming Crypto War will likely focus on the proper responsibilities of technology companies and law enforcement, its important to bear in mind the wide swath cryptography now cuts. Strong cryptos implications to protect user privacy and create challenges for law enforcement surveillance are obvious. However, cryptography impacts other significant technology debates of our time.\nFor example, network neutrality  the idea that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) shouldnt discriminate against or favor different services  is directly impacted by cryptography. By encrypting data as it moves across the wire, ISPs cannot inspect the contents of packets in order to discriminate between services. Cryptography also prevents ISPs from inserting tracking cookies in their users data streams, a practice some providers like Verizon have begun implementing in order to develop new advertising-based revenue streams.\nGovernment regulation of Internet content also depends on controlling cryptographic content. Regimes that block certain content from entering their borders inherently need to inspect Internet traffic. In many instances where state actors have taken this approach, encrypted traffic is simply blocked outright since it cannot be inspected. That approach, of course, only works so long as a majority of Internet traffic is unencrypted. As more of the Internet adopts strong crypto, the ability of a regime to control what information flows across its borders is threatened.\nCryptography is even challenging traditional monetary systems. Bitcoin, the most popular of the so-called crypto currencies, depends on some of the same cryptographic algorithms that Apple uses to secure messages sent between iPhone users. Rather than Bitcoins money supply being controlled by a central bank, the value of the currency depends on the math behind the cryptography algorithm itself. Some governments have banned the use of Bitcoin, suggesting it poses an existential threat to their ability to regulate financial transactions. The challenge, however, just as in the first Crypto War, is that the algorithms are simple, widely known, and broadly used across many applications making it very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.\nProceed with caution\nToday, the technology industry is more powerful and better organized than it was when it won the first Crypto War. However, I am concerned that the industry underestimates the threat posed by regulators reluctant to give in to the broad use of strong crypto, and in doing so, give up some level of control. As we fight the coming Crypto War, it is important that the technology industry acknowledge the challenges of law enforcement and legitimate government interests at stake. And, at the same time, it is critical for government policy makers to educate themselves about the broad impact of strong crypto and the potential unintended consequences of trying to weaken it.\nAuthor:\nMatthew Prince\nis Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Cloudflare\nImage: A security camera overlooks a man as he walks down a street in London November 2, 2006.

I can use a credit card online / offline much easier and cheaper then I can BTC. With Bitcoin you have to go through the hassle of acquiring it (not to mention fees), then a couple cents to send it to the merchant (miner fee). The best part is waiting for the confirmations... My most recent BTC transaction took over an hour to receive a single confirmation. Say someone manages to steal my Bitcoins, or I accidentally send them to the wrong address. Oops, they are gone forever. So now I also have to worry about and spend the time to secure my funds. With a credit card I get paid to use it (through rewards points, not carrying a balance), if a thief manages to steal money from me I can dispute the charges and get my cash back. Transactions are instant and painless, no need to go through multiple steps. I have been with Bitcoin for nearly three years now, I actually understand how it works. Its not an efficient system. Look up Ripple if you want to see a system that could actually work in our society and not some fantasy land\"\n----\n", "views": 382, "author": "sdersdf3 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 280 Merit: 250 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObstacles to bitcoin adoption\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-01-24 13:34:21", "content": "obstacle ?\nmentality.\nit's easier to move FIAT money to BTC exchange and buy BTC ... now.\n", "author": "Meuh6879 Legendary Offline Activity: 1512 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-01-24 13:37:04", "content": "Use of credit card is not cheaper but instead is costlier.

I have bought at the bottom (or close to) of every crash. I love those times!\nWhen there is nothing wrong with the fundamentals/nothing has changed but everyone is panicking, I know it's turning towards buying times.\nWhen everyone is depressed and calling the end of bitcoin, it's time to buy.\nMost people are driven by irrational feelings. When price is going up, they see the quick buck and will buy. When price is going down, they cry themselves to sleep, wondering why they did not sell earlier. I see it as if you act the opposite way, you will gain.\nA friend asked me at what price I will sell my coins. I answered him never. At the price point where I can think of selling my coins, they are at a level where everyone accepts them and there is no longer any need for fiat currency. At that point no one will talk about selling bitcoins, since they are the base.\nI know it might seem strange that I feel exhilarate at these times when bitcoin price is at rock bottom and a lot of people, including me, have seen their assets diminish substantially.

Hmm... It's not great. But they do have voting. Voting is useful. It has been misused to legitimize politics but voting can be very useful for a lot of clean purposes like determining the popular value of a blog post. So, Reddit has got this already. But there's something wrong with Reddit. It's not perfect. There are issues. I'm not a big fan. Let's have a look at Ethereum this morning. I wonder how things are going over there. I read some new status updates that indicate that the product will be released on schedule in March. Some of it alpha like Mist. hmm... Let's see. It is an interesting project but some parts of execution and presentation have not been great. If it's a success it will obviously have a big impact on the whole Bitcoin ecosystem. Imagine if we start switching Blockchains... Now that's a big switch, considering all the projects that are already built on top of Bitcoin. Counterparty is interesting too. I wonder if it would scale. It's a bit expensive to send tokens now. I have heard some indications that the cost might be reduced eventually. The Counterparty team wants to implement Ethereum. I wonder how that works technically speaking. Is the Bitcoin Blockchain adaptable enough for all this new technology that were not built yet 5 years ago? Is Krellenstein coding away? Or is the project growing so quickly that they are focusing more on buysiness growth now?\nThis morning someone had left fishbones on the street outside my house. Disgusting. But they formed a pattern. The pattern clearly said \"Gaze into the blockchain\". So I did. Hope those fishbones ain't telling lies. I had ants outside the house too. The ants were walking around in a pattern that reminded me of a waltz. Scurrying around the lawn. Hello little ants. Hello oh giant, they replied. The sea is full of anemones. Spacey looking things with lots of jelly arms. Various colors. Sitting on the ocean floor. In some rock or crevice. I wonder what they are thinking about. I sit on the cliffs. Sun dried. Looking down at the water below. Enjoying the weather. Thinking about nothing. The water is blue. Dark blue. I can jump right in. Look at the little fish. No jellyfish here. Nothing to worry about. Calm waters. The stars above. Far away. Yet the light reaches us. Far away places. Unfathomably far. Look, there's a jellyfish after all. Swooping around. Feeling the flow. Moving with the waves. In touch with the sea. Now think about a glass of water. Right there on the dining table. Not a single wave. Or are there? Tranquilent and utterly engulfable. Sweet water. Actually not sweet. But certainly not salt either. Think about the cell. The cells are freaking complex. At the same time they are full of water. They would not be operational without water. Water is a necessity for the organells to function. A universe in its own way. An unimaginably complex mechanism. Compare this to a simple battery. Just allowing electrons to move from one pole to the other. It is like comparing the stock market with a single transaction. Performing one simple function. Two states only, providing electricity and not doing so.\nLinks:\nOk, here are some links.\n#I am selling tokens (GITC). Blank tokens, no promises, no backing or anything.

But thats not all. Once we picked our name, a fun fact emerged. We realized that NASAs Project Gemini was a spaceflight program focused on laying the groundwork for Apollos later mission to land man on the Moon.

Bitcoin mentioned briefly.\nFeel free to comment.\nSource\nhttps://agenda.weforum.org/2015/01/the-second-crypto-war-and-the-future-of-the-internet/\nThe second Crypto War and the future of the internet\nIn the early 1990s, the first Crypto War began. With the release of Phil Zimmermans PGP in 1991, for the first time in history, anyone could encode and exchange a message that no law enforcement agency had the technical ability to intercept and decode.\nFearing that criminals would be able to hide their communications, the reaction of governments worldwide was swift. The United States, for instance, banned the export of what it deemed strong crypto. Early versions of Internet software such as Netscapes Communicator browser and Lotus Notes came in two flavors: a Domestic version that supported strong 128-bit crypto and an International version that supported weak 40-bit crypto.\nBut the genie was out of the bottle. The math equations that powered both strong and weak crypto systems were identical and elegantly simple. The difference between strong and weak was merely the length of the keys they used. Regulating the length of a key  effectively akin to telling you that youre not allowed to use a password thats more than a certain number of characters  proved impossible. And, by the early 2000s, the technologists prevailed. Restrictions on the use and export of strong cryptosystems were largely dropped, and the first Crypto War came to a close.\nFirst shots in the next Crypto War\nHistory may attribute the Archduke Ferdinand moment that spawned the second Crypto War to a cheeky little smiley face, hand drawn on a United States National Security Agency diagram which was revealed to the public on October 30, 2013. On that day, the\nWashington Post published\nthe diagram from the trove of secret documents revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\nSource:\nWashington Post\n, 30 October 2013\nThe document showed how the US was tapping Googles private communication lines over which messages between the companys data centers were being exchanged unencrypted. The cheeky smiley face denoted the place on Googles infrastructure where crypto was added and removed. To the NSA, it was a clever way to sneak behind the strong crypto lines and capture messages where they werent encoded. To the technology industry, it was nothing short of a declaration of war.\nThe technologists fight back\nSince then, the technologists have scrambled to add strong cryptographic protections even to those parts of their systems that were previously considered private. Apple, for instance, with the release of the latest version of the companys iPhone software, has designed a messaging system where it doesnt have a way of reading messages that pass between two users. If youre using an up-to-date iPhone to send a text message to another iPhone user, and the little bubble containing your message is blue, then neither Apple, nor your ISP, nor any law enforcement agency tapping into the transmission line is likely able to read the contents of the message.\nThis intentional blinding of user content not only thwarts mass surveillance, but also many of the techniques of targeted law enforcement. If Apple doesnt have the contents of their users messages, the company has no way of responding to a warrant requesting that content. Previously, companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and others have acted as a centralized repository of user data that law enforcement could turn to during an investigation. As the second Crypto War heats up, these companies are engineering new ways to lock their users data away even from legal process.\nAnd, again, as in the first Crypto War, the response from government has been swift. British Prime Minister David Cameron recently pledged that modern forms of communication should not be exempt from being listened to. Director of GCHQ Robert Hannigan urged that companies needed to help with allowing surveillance of their networks, describing social media networks as a terrorists command-and-control network of choice. And US FBI Director James Comey suggested companies should be required to design intercept solutions into their technologies.\nCryptographys broad swath\nWhile debate in the coming Crypto War will likely focus on the proper responsibilities of technology companies and law enforcement, its important to bear in mind the wide swath cryptography now cuts. Strong cryptos implications to protect user privacy and create challenges for law enforcement surveillance are obvious. However, cryptography impacts other significant technology debates of our time.\nFor example, network neutrality  the idea that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) shouldnt discriminate against or favor different services  is directly impacted by cryptography. By encrypting data as it moves across the wire, ISPs cannot inspect the contents of packets in order to discriminate between services. Cryptography also prevents ISPs from inserting tracking cookies in their users data streams, a practice some providers like Verizon have begun implementing in order to develop new advertising-based revenue streams.\nGovernment regulation of Internet content also depends on controlling cryptographic content. Regimes that block certain content from entering their borders inherently need to inspect Internet traffic. In many instances where state actors have taken this approach, encrypted traffic is simply blocked outright since it cannot be inspected. That approach, of course, only works so long as a majority of Internet traffic is unencrypted. As more of the Internet adopts strong crypto, the ability of a regime to control what information flows across its borders is threatened.\nCryptography is even challenging traditional monetary systems. Bitcoin, the most popular of the so-called crypto currencies, depends on some of the same cryptographic algorithms that Apple uses to secure messages sent between iPhone users. Rather than Bitcoins money supply being controlled by a central bank, the value of the currency depends on the math behind the cryptography algorithm itself. Some governments have banned the use of Bitcoin, suggesting it poses an existential threat to their ability to regulate financial transactions. The challenge, however, just as in the first Crypto War, is that the algorithms are simple, widely known, and broadly used across many applications making it very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.\nProceed with caution\nToday, the technology industry is more powerful and better organized than it was when it won the first Crypto War. However, I am concerned that the industry underestimates the threat posed by regulators reluctant to give in to the broad use of strong crypto, and in doing so, give up some level of control. As we fight the coming Crypto War, it is important that the technology industry acknowledge the challenges of law enforcement and legitimate government interests at stake. And, at the same time, it is critical for government policy makers to educate themselves about the broad impact of strong crypto and the potential unintended consequences of trying to weaken it.\nAuthor:\nMatthew Prince\nis Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Cloudflare\nImage: A security camera overlooks a man as he walks down a street in London November 2, 2006.

I can use a credit card online / offline much easier and cheaper then I can BTC. With Bitcoin you have to go through the hassle of acquiring it (not to mention fees), then a couple cents to send it to the merchant (miner fee). The best part is waiting for the confirmations... My most recent BTC transaction took over an hour to receive a single confirmation. Say someone manages to steal my Bitcoins, or I accidentally send them to the wrong address. Oops, they are gone forever. So now I also have to worry about and spend the time to secure my funds. With a credit card I get paid to use it (through rewards points, not carrying a balance), if a thief manages to steal money from me I can dispute the charges and get my cash back. Transactions are instant and painless, no need to go through multiple steps. I have been with Bitcoin for nearly three years now, I actually understand how it works. Its not an efficient system. Look up Ripple if you want to see a system that could actually work in our society and not some fantasy land\"\n----\n", "views": 382, "author": "sdersdf3 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 280 Merit: 250 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObstacles to bitcoin adoption\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-01-24 13:34:21", "content": "obstacle ?\nmentality.\nit's easier to move FIAT money to BTC exchange and buy BTC ... now.\n", "author": "Meuh6879 Legendary Offline Activity: 1512 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-01-24 13:37:04", "content": "Use of credit card is not cheaper but instead is costlier.

I love those times!\nWhen there is nothing wrong with the fundamentals/nothing has changed but everyone is panicking, I know it's turning towards buying times.\nWhen everyone is depressed and calling the end of bitcoin, it's time to buy.\nMost people are driven by irrational feelings. When price is going up, they see the quick buck and will buy. When price is going down, they cry themselves to sleep, wondering why they did not sell earlier. I see it as if you act the opposite way, you will gain.\nA friend asked me at what price I will sell my coins. I answered him never. At the price point where I can think of selling my coins, they are at a level where everyone accepts them and there is no longer any need for fiat currency. At that point no one will talk about selling bitcoins, since they are the base.\nI know it might seem strange that I feel exhilarate at these times when bitcoin price is at rock bottom and a lot of people, including me, have seen their assets diminish substantially.
