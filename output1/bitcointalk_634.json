Blockchain is the materialization of the connection using the peer to peer technology. The peer to per technology make possible the connection between two computers without the need of servers. So normally every information with all the kind of actual technologies applied to the internet to arrive from an computer (which send it) to another (which must received it) must go first in a server and then at its destination.  With peer to peer go directly from the first one to the second one. Eliminating the server. And the costs needed to realize and paid such kind of service. This mean reduction of costs. To much reduction. This is the power of peer to peer and the blockchain (which is the materialization of peer to peer in the above case). And its application can be in several fields of work of one bank.

It was a bug with the crawler and Bitcoin wasn't even that popular at that time.\nThe early December 2013 network snapshots, i.e. with over 100k nodes, are not valid as the crawler at that time took several hours just to complete one full network snapshot and it includes all nodes from addr responses which can be faked or likely stale. Those snapshots were linked to from getaddr.bitnodes.io/SNAPSHOT_NUMBER/ which have been removed since.\nWith the new crawler released in late Dec 2013, the crawl time was brought down significantly down to sub 5 minutes with considerably good churn rate. I use the churn rate to measure how good a network snapshot is. A value of 0 implies the network snapshot was taken instantly but of course that's not possible. At the moment, we are seeing a typical churn rate of 30+:\nhttps://getaddr.bitnodes.io/nodes/\nBitcoin does need more geographically distributed and stable node. Powerful nodes isn't a must.

I really hope that doesn't happen.\nAs for internal and bank-to-bank transfers:\nI can see how the banks would benefit from this and it seems feasible. They would still have to figure out how to distribute the blockchain in such a way as to ensure its security, and that could be tricky if lots of banks are involved (e.g. how many nodes can each bank have, how to allocate nodes for new banks, etc.).\nThanks for the comments.

It was a bug with the crawler and Bitcoin wasn't even that popular at that time.\nThe early December 2013 network snapshots, i.e. with over 100k nodes, are not valid as the crawler at that time took several hours just to complete one full network snapshot and it includes all nodes from addr responses which can be faked or likely stale. Those snapshots were linked to from getaddr.bitnodes.io/SNAPSHOT_NUMBER/ which have been removed since.\nWith the new crawler released in late Dec 2013, the crawl time was brought down significantly down to sub 5 minutes with considerably good churn rate.

At the moment, we are seeing a typical churn rate of 30+:\nhttps://getaddr.bitnodes.io/nodes/\nBitcoin does need more geographically distributed and stable node. Powerful nodes isn't a must.
