Of that number, more than 50,000 took place between 2006 and 2010. So now that Colorado has officially legalized the commercial sale and consumption of marijuana, how many of those people arrested for previous weed crimes will be let out of prison?

Cause there are victims only when you run into somebody else.\nAlso , everybody should start their own shops without licenses or without paying taxes as probably there will no victims from this either.\nRather than arguing about how the law is applied change the law.\nI agree with you that we do need rules in our society and it is appropriate to punish people who do not follow the rules. With that being said the government also needs to follow certain rules to make sure people have a fair chance in court when they are charged with a crime, and to follow rules regarding a person's \"papers\" (rules regarding search and seizure).\nRegarding if Charlie apparently broke the rules, I would say yes, but only from a technical standpoint. He could have changed his behavior in a very minor way to stay in compliance with the law and the outcome of the transactions in question would not have changed.\nRegarding the government following the rules, I would say they almost certainly did break them. Their getting access to the SR servers is questionable at best (they admit to not having a warrant prior to receiving the copy of the server). Also IIRC they had seized the servers of an email service that was marketed to TOR users, and some of Charlie's communications were from this service. I don't see the legal justification here to for the government to be able to read all of the emails on this email service without specific warrants that document probable cause.\nThe US Govt doesn't use logic concerning laws.\nIn the past 25 years, 210,000 marijuana-related arrests have been made in the state of Colorado alone. Of that number, more than 50,000 took place between 2006 and 2010. So now that Colorado has officially legalized the commercial sale and consumption of marijuana, how many of those people arrested for previous weed crimes will be let out of prison? Or, if theyve already served their time, how many will have their marijuana crimes expunged from their records, making it easier to get a job?\nThe answer: Zero on all counts.\nThe United States is one of the only countries in the world that doesnt guarantee whats called retroactive ameliorative relief in sentencing. Meaning, when a law is passed to ease or eliminate punishments for a specific crime, those already convicted of that crime dont necessarily receive the same relaxation or cessation of their sentence.\nhttp://www.takepart.com/article/2013/01/02/no-relief-convicted\nThis is not the only thing that the US is alone in the way they operate. (overseas taxes is a big one).\nMy point wasn't so much that the law changed after the fact, but is rather that if Charlie had followed the law to the \"t\" then the same transactions would have happened, no additional reporting would have been given to the government about any of the transactions. The only real difference to the outcome is that bitinstant would have higher compliance costs.\nI think that it would be hard to argue that \"society\" was a victim in this case.\n", "author": "itsAj Hero Member Offline Activity: 588 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-09-07 18:14:07", "content": "I definitely agree with that.\n", "author": "QuestionAuthority Legendary Offline Activity: 1960 Merit: 1315 You lead and I'll watch you walk away.

In the United States, the Constitution lays this out clearly. Section 8 permits Congress the right to coin money, and Section 10 denies the states or anyone else that right. Creating a physical alternative to the U.S. dollar isnt just difficult, its outright illegal.\nThen came Bitcoin. What makes Bitcoin so unique (and legal) is that it is a digital currency and, thus, never minted. While its popularity has grown substantially in the past two years, the currency has actually been floating around since 2009, when it allegedly was created by clandestine developer Satoshi Nakamoto. Since that time, the currency has gone from little more than a theory to being worth as much as $1,200 per Bitcoin. At time of publication, it was trading just below $500.\nBitcoins are created through a process called mining, and they only exist in a computer file known as the blockchain, which is akin to a complex puzzle. After a computer works on the blockchain for a certain amount of time, a piece of the puzzle is solved, releasing 25 Bitcoins (rate halves in mid-2016) to the solver.\nSeems easy, right? Buy a bunch of computers and get to mining! While this is how it worked early in Bitcoins existence, it isnt quite that simple any longer. Part of the genius of Bitcoin is how elegant it is as a functioning monetary base. As more Bitcoins come into existence, the blockchain puzzle becomes progressively more difficult. The monetary base of Bitcoin was built to grow by 3% annually. This number was not chosen randomly: A 3% inflation rate is considered a healthy target for developed economies, and is near the figure targeted by central banks around the world.\nAs Bitcoins popularity has exploded in the past two years, the mining has grown exponentially more difficult and expensive. Whereas in 2009 it was possible to utilize a standard home PC for mining purposes, today it takes highly specialized kits to mine profitably. One has to remember, computers cost money and run on electricity. So, if you are running a non-specialized PC, it may cost $100 in electricity to mine $25 worth of Bitcoins. While some hobbyists still engage in such operations (I tried it myself), it is obviously far from a sound business.\nTo seriously mine Bitcoins it takes a minimum of a $5,000 investment. Companies like Butterfly Labs build specialized graphic cards designed specifically for blockchain hashing. These cards cost several thousand dollars and are typically back-ordered for months. To be in the business of Bitcoin mining requires an entire fleet of this equipment, which can easily cost $100,000 or more. To further complicate mining, this equipment typically is obsolete in six to 12 months, meaning further capital outlays are constantly needed to stay profitable. Entrepreneurs who have been successful at mining have significant capital, both intellectual and dollar denominated. Cheap access to power also helpsdifferent parts of the country can have widely varying kilowatt costs.\nIf it is not profitable for the average person to mine Bitcoins any longer, then why has it exploded in popularity? The answer is twofold in my mind. First, and most importantly, central banks around the world have done very little to build confidence in paper currencies since the financial crisis in 2007. Furthermore, countries around the globe have taken on dramatic amounts of debt over the past seven years, resulting in an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratios of every developed market, and most of them have even doubled.\nOpen exchange rates have made fiat (paper) currencies viable since the removal of the gold standard in 1971. If one country practiced irresponsible monetary policies, the exchange rates punished them and devalued their currency. But what happens when everyone acts irresponsibly? Bitcoin is what happens.\nThe second reason Bitcoin has become so popular is that it has caught the attention of the investing community. The virtual currency has turned into a haven for speculators due to the extreme volatility of its exchange rate; at times it has doubled in the span of just a few weeks.\nBy design, there is a finite amount of Bitcoins that will ever be mined (20,999,839.77, to be exact). With a constrained supply, hedge funds have looked to corner the market on Bitcoin and have accumulated substantial holdings in the currency.\nThis environment is what has made Bitcoin a viable currency. It is in its infancy and there is still much that can go wrong. Two of its most recent hiccups were Mt. Gox (a large exchange and bank for Bitcoin) going bust, and a March 2014 IRS ruling that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies will be treated as property for IRS purposes, not currency.\n...\nhttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/bitcoin-virtual-currency/\n", "views": 912, "author": "LakeBTC Hero Member Offline Activity: 910 Merit: 1000 LakeBTC.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin: The Next Virtual Reality?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-09-06 10:34:12", "content": "It's so 2009.\n", "author": "devphp Sr. Member Offline Activity: 336 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-09-06 16:04:44", "content": "The software is perfect just like the theory, stop the \"its good theory but software may get replaced\" bullshit lol.\n", "author": "BeeTeeSea Member Offline Activity: 70 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-09-06 16:25:22", "content": "short version of OP's first point\n'mining' is like 'minting' but without making the 't' sound of casting a coin with a hammer, thus making it legal\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-09-06 16:54:39", "content": "It can be but not really it will be.There even the Earth is not promised then how would a man made bunch of code be said will not get banned or seized?\n", "author": "Altminer79 Member Offline Activity: 76 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-09-06 17:42:03", "content": "It's a somewhat well put together article, even tho a bit pretentous with the virtual reality shit lol.\n", "author": "nicepumper Jr. Member Offline Activity: 56 Merit: 0 "}], "date": "2014-09-06 10:00:30"}, {"content": "So how is Google going to counter this?  I have seen some say that Google should jump into Bitcoin and pull the rug out from Apple.  Apple is touting reduced credit card fees and Google could up that to discounts + zero fees.  They could run all this via Android and Chrome + G-NFC devices.  Any thoughts?\n", "views": 734, "author": "keywi Newbie Offline Activity: 8 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple is going proprietary hardware/software and traditional payment systems. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-09-06 09:53:47", "content": "So how is Google going to counter this?  I have seen some say that Google should jump into Bitcoin and pull the rug out from Apple.  Apple is touting reduced credit card fees and Google could up that to discounts + zero fees.  They could run all this via Android and Chrome + G-NFC devices.  Any thoughts?\nWould be nice to prove a source to the start of this discussion so people can read up easier... in general both companies have attempted to compete over the same markets rather than split directions.

Our voluntary community is now over 5 million people, spread throughout every country in the world. Every day new economic barriers are broken down, as diverse and talented people curiously spend 30 seconds opening a free bitcoin wallet online or downloading a wallet app. The Commonwealth nations of Jersey and Isle of Man are finally recognizing our achievements, and Singapore is investing in a Bitcoin future. In the past year, our fellow Bitcoin businesses have received over EC$700 million in investment from excited venture capitalists from every financial center from New York, to Hong Kong.\nWe have a lot to celebrate, and new found wealth to spend but, in our excitement at solving fundamental problems in accounting and finance, we have been focusing more on innovation than on reaching the people.\nThe time has come to reach out and invite the people of the world to participate in this new, open economy. We would like to start by inviting the Dominican people to the official Bitcoin Pi Day party. This is a math joke, and a perfectly good time to throw a party celebrating free software. Next March 14th at 9:26am (3.14.15 9:26) we will be sending every person in Dominica with any type of cell phone an invite.\nletthebitdrop.com\nThe text message invite is your token to receive EC$26 worth of bitcoin to spend on the day of the party. Consider this a gift from your internet neighbors, and join us eating, drinking, and getting down to the music of freedom. Everyone there will accept bitcoin, so just come and have fun.\nWell be working with local groups and businesses in the coming months, so those among you who already know Bitcoin will have lots of support. Our goal is to have enough local businesses to agree to accept bitcoin that we can supply everything that The Bit Drop needs. Drinks, food, music, performing artists, whatever makes a good party. Were going to talk to people and see what we can do together. Believe me, bitcoiners will fly from all over the world to listen to music, drink Kubuli beer, and eat delicious Caribbean food.\nThis all sounds like good fun, and it is. Dominic is The Nature Isle. Tropical beauty, bubbly beaches, hot springs, fresh mangos, plentiful and glorious marine life like sperm whales. True, some other islands have some of those things. I am from Panama, and we have lovely beaches, particularly on the Caribbean side. Panama City is also a maze of beautiful towers and displays of financial success.\nAnother reason for Dominica is that we want to show off Bitcoins ability to provide a solid economic boost. This application that some people thought would be a toy now runs an economy larger than dozens of countries, including Dominica. We have not yet consulted professional economists, but it is not unreasonable to estimate that The Bit Drop could stimulate Dominicas economy by EC$8 million or around 0.5% of Dominicas total yearly Gross Domestic Product. This is the message we want to send to the world. Bitcoin can provide economic opportunities in your community.\nWe will one day soon throw a party like even Panama has never seen. Well throw a party in Jamaica, Antigua, Barbados, and around the Caribbean and Latin America, and the world. We wont stop until all people know the power they have over their own finances.

Our voluntary community is now over 5 million people, spread throughout every country in the world. Every day new economic barriers are broken down, as diverse and talented people curiously spend 30 seconds opening a free bitcoin wallet online or downloading a wallet app. The Commonwealth nations of Jersey and Isle of Man are finally recognizing our achievements, and Singapore is investing in a Bitcoin future. In the past year, our fellow Bitcoin businesses have received over EC$700 million in investment from excited venture capitalists from every financial center from New York, to Hong Kong.\nWe have a lot to celebrate, and new found wealth to spend but, in our excitement at solving fundamental problems in accounting and finance, we have been focusing more on innovation than on reaching the people.\nThe time has come to reach out and invite the people of the world to participate in this new, open economy. We would like to start by inviting the Dominican people to the official Bitcoin Pi Day party. This is a math joke, and a perfectly good time to throw a party celebrating free software. Next March 14th at 9:26am (3.14.15 9:26) we will be sending every person in Dominica with any type of cell phone an invite.\nletthebitdrop.com\nThe text message invite is your token to receive EC$26 worth of bitcoin to spend on the day of the party. Consider this a gift from your internet neighbors, and join us eating, drinking, and getting down to the music of freedom. Everyone there will accept bitcoin, so just come and have fun.\nWell be working with local groups and businesses in the coming months, so those among you who already know Bitcoin will have lots of support. Our goal is to have enough local businesses to agree to accept bitcoin that we can supply everything that The Bit Drop needs. Drinks, food, music, performing artists, whatever makes a good party. Were going to talk to people and see what we can do together. Believe me, bitcoiners will fly from all over the world to listen to music, drink Kubuli beer, and eat delicious Caribbean food.\nThis all sounds like good fun, and it is. Dominic is The Nature Isle. Tropical beauty, bubbly beaches, hot springs, fresh mangos, plentiful and glorious marine life like sperm whales. True, some other islands have some of those things. I am from Panama, and we have lovely beaches, particularly on the Caribbean side. Panama City is also a maze of beautiful towers and displays of financial success.\nAnother reason for Dominica is that we want to show off Bitcoins ability to provide a solid economic boost. This application that some people thought would be a toy now runs an economy larger than dozens of countries, including Dominica. We have not yet consulted professional economists, but it is not unreasonable to estimate that The Bit Drop could stimulate Dominicas economy by EC$8 million or around 0.5% of Dominicas total yearly Gross Domestic Product. This is the message we want to send to the world. Bitcoin can provide economic opportunities in your community.\nWe will one day soon throw a party like even Panama has never seen. Well throw a party in Jamaica, Antigua, Barbados, and around the Caribbean and Latin America, and the world. We wont stop until all people know the power they have over their own finances.

I said it about the vision that is emboldened in my quote.\n", "author": "BitCoinDream Legendary Offline Activity: 1302 Merit: 1002 The revolution will be digital "}], "date": "2014-09-06 21:48:48"}, {"content": "A fundamental aspect of any sovereign economy is the right to mint and value a currency. In the United States, the Constitution lays this out clearly. Section 8 permits Congress the right to coin money, and Section 10 denies the states or anyone else that right. Creating a physical alternative to the U.S. dollar isnt just difficult, its outright illegal.\nThen came Bitcoin. What makes Bitcoin so unique (and legal) is that it is a digital currency and, thus, never minted. While its popularity has grown substantially in the past two years, the currency has actually been floating around since 2009, when it allegedly was created by clandestine developer Satoshi Nakamoto. Since that time, the currency has gone from little more than a theory to being worth as much as $1,200 per Bitcoin. At time of publication, it was trading just below $500.\nBitcoins are created through a process called mining, and they only exist in a computer file known as the blockchain, which is akin to a complex puzzle. After a computer works on the blockchain for a certain amount of time, a piece of the puzzle is solved, releasing 25 Bitcoins (rate halves in mid-2016) to the solver.\nSeems easy, right? Buy a bunch of computers and get to mining! While this is how it worked early in Bitcoins existence, it isnt quite that simple any longer. Part of the genius of Bitcoin is how elegant it is as a functioning monetary base. As more Bitcoins come into existence, the blockchain puzzle becomes progressively more difficult. The monetary base of Bitcoin was built to grow by 3% annually. This number was not chosen randomly: A 3% inflation rate is considered a healthy target for developed economies, and is near the figure targeted by central banks around the world.\nAs Bitcoins popularity has exploded in the past two years, the mining has grown exponentially more difficult and expensive. Whereas in 2009 it was possible to utilize a standard home PC for mining purposes, today it takes highly specialized kits to mine profitably. One has to remember, computers cost money and run on electricity. So, if you are running a non-specialized PC, it may cost $100 in electricity to mine $25 worth of Bitcoins. While some hobbyists still engage in such operations (I tried it myself), it is obviously far from a sound business.\nTo seriously mine Bitcoins it takes a minimum of a $5,000 investment. Companies like Butterfly Labs build specialized graphic cards designed specifically for blockchain hashing. These cards cost several thousand dollars and are typically back-ordered for months. To be in the business of Bitcoin mining requires an entire fleet of this equipment, which can easily cost $100,000 or more. To further complicate mining, this equipment typically is obsolete in six to 12 months, meaning further capital outlays are constantly needed to stay profitable. Entrepreneurs who have been successful at mining have significant capital, both intellectual and dollar denominated. Cheap access to power also helpsdifferent parts of the country can have widely varying kilowatt costs.\nIf it is not profitable for the average person to mine Bitcoins any longer, then why has it exploded in popularity? The answer is twofold in my mind. First, and most importantly, central banks around the world have done very little to build confidence in paper currencies since the financial crisis in 2007. Furthermore, countries around the globe have taken on dramatic amounts of debt over the past seven years, resulting in an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratios of every developed market, and most of them have even doubled.\nOpen exchange rates have made fiat (paper) currencies viable since the removal of the gold standard in 1971. If one country practiced irresponsible monetary policies, the exchange rates punished them and devalued their currency. But what happens when everyone acts irresponsibly? Bitcoin is what happens.\nThe second reason Bitcoin has become so popular is that it has caught the attention of the investing community. The virtual currency has turned into a haven for speculators due to the extreme volatility of its exchange rate; at times it has doubled in the span of just a few weeks.\nBy design, there is a finite amount of Bitcoins that will ever be mined (20,999,839.77, to be exact). With a constrained supply, hedge funds have looked to corner the market on Bitcoin and have accumulated substantial holdings in the currency.\nThis environment is what has made Bitcoin a viable currency. It is in its infancy and there is still much that can go wrong. Two of its most recent hiccups were Mt. Gox (a large exchange and bank for Bitcoin) going bust, and a March 2014 IRS ruling that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies will be treated as property for IRS purposes, not currency.\n...\nhttp://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/advisorvoices/bitcoin-virtual-currency/\n", "views": 912, "author": "LakeBTC Hero Member Offline Activity: 910 Merit: 1000 LakeBTC.com ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin: The Next Virtual Reality?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-09-06 10:34:12", "content": "It's so 2009.\n", "author": "devphp Sr. Member Offline Activity: 336 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-09-06 16:04:44", "content": "The software is perfect just like the theory, stop the \"its good theory but software may get replaced\" bullshit lol.\n", "author": "BeeTeeSea Member Offline Activity: 70 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-09-06 16:25:22", "content": "short version of OP's first point\n'mining' is like 'minting' but without making the 't' sound of casting a coin with a hammer, thus making it legal\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-09-06 16:54:39", "content": "It can be but not really it will be.There even the Earth is not promised then how would a man made bunch of code be said will not get banned or seized?\n", "author": "Altminer79 Member Offline Activity: 76 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2014-09-06 17:42:03", "content": "It's a somewhat well put together article, even tho a bit pretentous with the virtual reality shit lol.\n", "author": "nicepumper Jr. Member Offline Activity: 56 Merit: 0 "}], "date": "2014-09-06 10:00:30"}, {"content": "So how is Google going to counter this?  I have seen some say that Google should jump into Bitcoin and pull the rug out from Apple.  Apple is touting reduced credit card fees and Google could up that to discounts + zero fees.  They could run all this via Android and Chrome + G-NFC devices.  Any thoughts?\n", "views": 734, "author": "keywi Newbie Offline Activity: 8 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple is going proprietary hardware/software and traditional payment systems. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-09-06 09:53:47", "content": "So how is Google going to counter this?  I have seen some say that Google should jump into Bitcoin and pull the rug out from Apple.  Apple is touting reduced credit card fees and Google could up that to discounts + zero fees.  They could run all this via Android and Chrome + G-NFC devices.  Any thoughts?\nWould be nice to prove a source to the start of this discussion so people can read up easier... in general both companies have attempted to compete over the same markets rather than split directions.
