The \"hashrate\" of the network has always fluctuated somewhat however this can be attributed to variance in luck  of the overall network\n", "author": "Window2Wall Full Member Offline Activity: 192 Merit: 100 "}], "date": "2014-09-29 01:22:13"}, {"content": "Hello:\nI installed bitcoin on Ubuntu and i download bootstrap.dat and import it.

I really don't see anything that would prevent people from paying with bitcoin now when they win an auction.\nMostly, the fact that putting \"I accept bitcoin\" in their auction would cause eBay to cancel it.  This leaves no good way for a buyer who is willing to pay with bitcoin to find a seller who is wiling to accept bitcoin.  Sending messages to each seller as a buyer would take a monumental amount of time when most of them probably aren't going to accept bitcoin, and hoping to get a message from a buyer offering to pay with bitcoin when most buyers aren't even aware of bitcoin wouldn't leave one with very good odds.  Beyond that, I'm not sure how far eBay goes to enforce their terms, but since it's against the rules to negotiate and sell items listed on eBay to people who found them on eBay outside of eBay, I wouldn't be 100% surprised if a message sent on eBay about bitcoin could lead to an account suspension.  However, people who want to buy and sell with bitcoin have other sites they can use, just without as much \"protection,\" which the majority of users must think is free in spite of the fact that the sellers pay the fees and the buyers pay the higher prices.  The level of protection offered now (mostly to buyers) didn't always exist.  I've been scammed on eBay when paying through PayPal for physical goods that were never delivered.  The seller withdrew funds and eBay and PayPal didn't actually offer refunds via insurance, only reversals when possible.  Now, in order to get the protection everyone knows and loves, not only do the funds have to go through PayPal to ensure that PayPal and eBay get their cuts for the costs and/or risks they take providing protection, the fees have doubled and the funds also have to be escrowed for a long time for new sellers amongst other things.  The same fees and escrow periods will be true of auctions that accept bitcoin.  Allowing bitcoin to be sent directly to the seller would require the buyer to take all the risk, and most of the buyers on eBay don't want to do that.  More importantly, though, the majority of posters in this thread and the \"Amazon needs to accept bitcoin\" threads believe that these big powerhouses accepting and handling bitcoin will make other people who are not users more comfortable with the idea of bitcoin, spurring adoption, so even though you could theoretically win an auction from a seller who agrees to accept bitcoin after the fact (or even before you bid), that doesn't provide the benefit that everyone else here is looking for.\n", "author": "The00Dustin Hero Member Offline Activity: 807 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-09-10 12:59:00", "content": "I cant fucking wait until the day I get to buy something with BTC with ebay directly.\n", "author": "Poorri Jr. Member Offline Activity: 42 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 05:03:13", "content": "Icahn was right: EBay, PayPal to become separate companies\nhttp://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Icahn-was-right-EBay-PayPal-to-become-separate-5791009.php\n", "author": "CryptoCurrencyInc.com Sr. Member Offline Activity: 476 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-10-02 17:58:00", "content": "Icahn was right: EBay, PayPal to become separate companies\nhttp://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Icahn-was-right-EBay-PayPal-to-become-separate-5791009.php\nHmm now that is interesting\nI look forward to seeing how this turns out\n", "author": "freedomno1 Legendary Offline Activity: 1526 Merit: 1023 Activity: 9001 == OP "}, {"date": "2014-10-02 17:59:38", "content": "When we will be able to actually sell things and recieve BTC in ebay? ive been reading about this since forever.\n", "author": "ivanovasmd Jr. Member Offline Activity: 43 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2014-10-02 18:27:27", "content": "oh man, I hope ebay implements it.

forward nonsense claims your comprehension skills are lacking.  If you read at least the things relevant to this context, you would not say the things that you have said.\nIn this very thread numerous times I have implied a protocol, an order of how things are done.   Moreover, when you expressed ignorance of logical protocol I specifically laid out a general protocol that any reasonable cause coin would follow in such matters, did you miss it, are you ignoring it, or do you simply not understand it?\nYou mentioned \"money grab\" many times, such claims are irresponsible, wholly baseless, and dead wrong.   Where is your evidence?  When you said: \"... just to get exposure to your personal money grab\" what is that based on?\nYour overall assumption clearly is that something is bad, foul, or wrong.   But it isn't because of any logically drawn conclusion, it could only be due to ignorance of the facts, inappropriate/unreasonable drawing of conclusions, or a stubborn desire to only see things as you want to see them regardless of the facts or logical order.\nIf you look at the facts, draw logical conclusions based on the actual facts, it's impossible to reasonably get to where you are at on this matter.\nHere is evidence of how you cloud logical reasoning with your preconceived notions resulting in poor judgement, specious claims, and irresponsible conclusions:\n1)  you cast \"shame\" on an individual although there is no evidence of shameful activity,  [your irresponsible conclusion]\n2)  when 'all you see is a money grab' even though the actual history of the org is that of 'money give'.  [your specious claim]\n3)  when you said \"i see no actual real life benefit. no actual proof that any money sent to the OP will result in any lives saved or any cure found.\"\nHow could you have \"actual proof\" of something that hasn't taken place?  [your improper inclusion of facts not present]\nWhy would you demand statistical data for \"lives saved or any cure\" when neither were introduced?  [again, you just making things up]\n4)  when you said: \"i truly hate it when people use natural disasters to get rich\"\nHow does that have anything to do with us?    [your inappropriate connection]\nShow some reasonable and or logical evidence of how you connect that statement to me, our org, or this situation -- connect the dots.\nYour hate simply doesn't apply to us.  The way you arrived at the connection is because you allowed your misguided preconceived notions\nperhaps based on personal experiences wrongly cloud sensible and responsible judgement.\nInstead of you associating us with good guys on the good side of cryptocurrency development or philanthropic endeavors you wrongly lump us with bad guys, why's that?\nIf we were brand new with no track record your prejudices would be more understandable, but given our track record of excellence, and the responsibly way we carry out\nout our mission we are only deserving of praise.\nStep back and look at the whole picture we have a record of excellence, we are inviting all cause coins to be involved, and all are WELCOME (even you) there's nothing to hide: the house is transparent, the lights are on, and the doors are open, if you go by what you actually see not by things you make up everyone should be happy.\nNow you owe me a bigger apology.\n", "author": "Armis

have a comprehensive plan on the table for consideration.  EMC2's board only recently approved one small part of the measure, the EMC2 community at large has not gone that far as of yet.   Other cause coin communities are at various levels of discussion on the matter, so how is it that you think you can talk intelligently about specific when the concept is not yet fully formed much less initiated?\nThe obvious knowns are, Ebola is real problem, cause-coins are mission directed to do what they can to fight problems, and the leadership of two of such cause-coin have decided to further consider doing what they can to help fight ebola.   Just about everything else is unknown.  Which is why it is ridiculous to ask for specifics, and even worst to draw conclusions based on unknowns.\nThose who say Ebola is not a problem, or that cause-coins are ineffective, are likely wrong, but at least those are arguable matters in evidence.  What you are addressing are things not in

But right now you lose money buying the btc with your card.\nI just showed you how you can save 3% on every product imaginable with BTC so this means that 3 % savings - 1% fee for coinbase or circle = 2% savings on everything amazon sells or almost any gift card imaginable.\n", "author": "inBitweTrust Hero Member Offline Activity: 658 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-10-02 01:22:39", "content": "I just showed you how you can save 3% on every product imaginable with BTC so this means that 3 % savings - 1% fee for coinbase or circle = 2% savings on everything amazon sells or almost any gift card imaginable.\nActually circle charges a 3% fee!

(phase 2) before walmart/7-11 decides to offer discounts because payment processing is cheaper and they are getting free publicity from bitcoin.\nthe whole \"user adoption\" for everyday joe bloggs is not the point we are at. so be patient. have a cup of coffee and realise that bitcoin is not a fully grown up currency it is still a toddler, yes its volatile, having temper tantrums as toddlers do but its still crawling around and learning to walk. not yet ready to run.\nyour mindset is stuck on a very narrow vein of what bitcoins potential is, a vein pumping money around. bitcoin is far bigger, it has muscles it needs to flex and needs to show more movements of these muscles and not only the movements of money through its veins.\nim not sure i can make it any clearer. but you seem to think that bitcoin is a 100metre sprint and you want to be the one running home back to your comfort zone.\nbitcoin my friend is a triathlon.\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-10-02 01:58:49", "content": "I am not from the USA so I cant comment on coinbase.\nWell you certainly did make a comment about coinbase before.... now you are admitting to making up facts?\nI just went to circle.com and tried it myself.

Don't put the cart before the horse. The effect before the cause.\nYes, because their \"safe\" 401ks worked out so well. It's a hedge. They get paid a small % in btc as a part of their portfolio. As adoption grows, as the infrastructure grows, so does their incentive to accept a higher % of their wage in btc. it slowly transfers from a high risk investment/hedge to the norm. Not only do they begin to greatly reap the benefits of using btc in a closed loop, but their btc is likely appreciating greatly while we drive towards critical mass. It gets particularily interesting when it hits that oh so important tipping point.\nThis is a nice answer. Finally someone answers with something sensible and not just empty rhetoric.\nYou have a good plan. Promote BTC so that it gets a good image and slowly get people to adopt it. The promotion would be the key here. We would have to state the benefits such as no inflation. In this way the users go into it thinking that it is for the future. This wont get many average guys to adopt it, but some of the more wealthy would.

After this new low difficulty, he uses high mining power to create blocks at very high speed since the difficulty has dropped (on his own blockchain), meanwhile the true blockchain will have generated blocks that aren't included in those isolated chains, but due to him having low difficulty he generated twice the amount of blocks (or maybe x1.5 for example) if he then releases those nodes and they start interacting with other nodes, will this \"self generated\" chain become the \"true\" chain? I mean since it's a longer chain wouldn't it be the \"true\" blockchain? and that person would have actually reversed some transactions, and also generated new blocks and took the reward for himself?\nI got this theory while reading an article about selfish mining, but for selfish mining to work you'll need to have something around 25% hash rate? (can't remember the exact %)\nAnyway, the idea was taken from selfish mining, but I added that attacker needs to have couple nodes under his control and he isolate them in order to massively reduce the target difficulty so he can generate blocks at ridiculous high speed to make up for the time he didn't generate blocks while isolated.\nalso I'm not sure if 10 nodes are enough? maybe he needs something like 1/3 of total number of nodes to make sure that his blockchain will be published to everyone?\nThat's all, if anyone can explain if it's possible or not or if you can provide links to articles that help me finding the answer I'll be really appreciated, hope I explained my theory in an easy way.\nRead section 11 of the Bitcoin.pdf\nhttps://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\nAt section 11 it talks about the scenario you are proposing, like others are mentioning it would be impossible for the attacker to keep up with the honest chain unless they had 51% or more of the network, even if they made their own chain it would grow a a significantly slower rate since the difficulty will be high and it will take many blocks to readjust the difficulty. Even if the chain was copied 1 block before retargeting, this chain would most likely remain 1+ Blocks behind because they would have to solve atleast that last difficult block before the retarget.\n\"The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial\nRandom Walk.

I really don't see anything that would prevent people from paying with bitcoin now when they win an auction.\nMostly, the fact that putting \"I accept bitcoin\" in their auction would cause eBay to cancel it.  This leaves no good way for a buyer who is willing to pay with bitcoin to find a seller who is wiling to accept bitcoin.  Sending messages to each seller as a buyer would take a monumental amount of time when most of them probably aren't going to accept bitcoin, and hoping to get a message from a buyer offering to pay with bitcoin when most buyers aren't even aware of bitcoin wouldn't leave one with very good odds.  Beyond that, I'm not sure how far eBay goes to enforce their terms, but since it's against the rules to negotiate and sell items listed on eBay to people who found them on eBay outside of eBay, I wouldn't be 100% surprised if a message sent on eBay about bitcoin could lead to an account suspension.  However, people who want to buy and sell with bitcoin have other sites they can use, just without as much \"protection,\" which the majority of users must think is free in spite of the fact that the sellers pay the fees and the buyers pay the higher prices.  The level of protection offered now (mostly to buyers) didn't always exist.  I've been scammed on eBay when paying through PayPal for physical goods that were never delivered.  The seller withdrew funds and eBay and PayPal didn't actually offer refunds via insurance, only reversals when possible.  Now, in order to get the protection everyone knows and loves, not only do the funds have to go through PayPal to ensure that PayPal and eBay get their cuts for the costs and/or risks they take providing protection, the fees have doubled and the funds also have to be escrowed for a long time for new sellers amongst other things.  The same fees and escrow periods will be true of auctions that accept bitcoin.  Allowing bitcoin to be sent directly to the seller would require the buyer to take all the risk, and most of the buyers on eBay don't want to do that.  More importantly, though, the majority of posters in this thread and the \"Amazon needs to accept bitcoin\" threads believe that these big powerhouses accepting and handling bitcoin will make other people who are not users more comfortable with the idea of bitcoin, spurring adoption, so even though you could theoretically win an auction from a seller who agrees to accept bitcoin after the fact (or even before you bid), that doesn't provide the benefit that everyone else here is looking for.\n", "author": "The00Dustin Hero Member Offline Activity: 807 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-09-10 12:59:00", "content": "I cant fucking wait until the day I get to buy something with BTC with ebay directly.\n", "author": "Poorri Jr. Member Offline Activity: 42 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 05:03:13", "content": "Icahn was right: EBay, PayPal to become separate companies\nhttp://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Icahn-was-right-EBay-PayPal-to-become-separate-5791009.php\n", "author": "CryptoCurrencyInc.com Sr. Member Offline Activity: 476 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-10-02 17:58:00", "content": "Icahn was right: EBay, PayPal to become separate companies\nhttp://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Icahn-was-right-EBay-PayPal-to-become-separate-5791009.php\nHmm now that is interesting\nI look forward to seeing how this turns out\n", "author": "freedomno1 Legendary Offline Activity: 1526 Merit: 1023 Activity: 9001 == OP "}, {"date": "2014-10-02 17:59:38", "content": "When we will be able to actually sell things and recieve BTC in ebay? ive been reading about this since forever.\n", "author": "ivanovasmd Jr. Member Offline Activity: 43 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2014-10-02 18:27:27", "content": "oh man, I hope ebay implements it.

It's not like anyone would ever replace a human job with a machine.

It kills about half of those who contract it. It sometimes, though not always, leads to uncontrollable bleeding. But it's difficult to contract. The only way to catch Ebola is to have direct contact with the bodily fluids  vomit, sweat, blood, feces, urine or saliva  of someone who has Ebola and has begun showing symptoms.\nModern public-health systems can manage diseases that travel through bodily fluids. The techniques are laborious, but known. You isolate those who have contracted the disease, or might have contracted it. You find out who's been near them. You screen them for the disease. You isolate anyone who shows symptoms. You do this until the disease is stamped out. It works. And modern public-health systems know how to do it.\nRead more at\nhttp://www.freedomsphoenix.com/News/163957-2014-10-01-don-39-t-panic-over-ebola-in-america.htm\n.\n", "author": "BADecker Legendary Online Activity: 1792 Merit: 1046 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 16:14:54", "content": "Ebola is heavy in the news, EMC2 is considering leading a campaign to making a public donation to fight Ebola --  via Ebola research, public awareness, and scientific education.\nWe need to know many people are willing to contribute to the campaign, we want you to pledge your support.   We are specifically looking for people to pledge currency, volunteer time, retweets, facebook, reddit, IRC, etc posts, and assistance with a crowd-funding campaign.   If enough people pledge to do something great in this regard we will turn the best wishes into action.\nIn addition to the good it will do for the cause, it will also provide some positive exposure for the cryptocurrency community, we know that various media inside and outside of the CC community will want to pick-up the story.\nDepending on the number of people who would want to be involved this project will be very impressive.\nWe want to help fight Ebola, can we count on you to support this cause?\nYou should create a fundraiser and donate all the proceeds to Ebola research/public awareness.\nhttp://kryptokit.com/rush-fundraiser/\nhttp://rushwallet.com/\n", "author": "juju Sr. Member Offline Activity: 382 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 16:26:18", "content": "Since the subject is up then I guess this would provide a good read for anyone interested:\nhttp://www.naturalnews.com/046290_ebola_patent_vaccines_profit_motive.html\nThe \"patent number\" indicated in the article refers to a \"Also published as\" number.\nI searched the United States Patent and Trademark Office site USPTO.gov  http://www.uspto.gov/patents/process/search/index.jsp  under the patent number, inventor name, application date, application number, and other identifiers all resulted '0' found.\nClearly Google has recognized the information as a \"patent[ed]\" item however the US doesn't.\nI also checked the US copyright office, nothing there either.\nAs far as I'm concern the information is foundationally flawed.\nEbola is heavy in the news, EMC2 is considering leading a campaign to making a public donation to fight Ebola --  via Ebola research, public awareness, and scientific education.\nWe need to know many people are willing to contribute to the campaign, we want you to pledge your support.   We are specifically looking for people to pledge currency, volunteer time, retweets, facebook, reddit, IRC, etc posts, and assistance with a crowd-funding campaign.   If enough people pledge to do something great in this regard we will turn the best wishes into action.\nIn addition to the good it will do for the cause, it will also provide some positive exposure for the cryptocurrency community, we know that various media inside and outside of the CC community will want to pick-up the story.\nDepending on the number of people who would want to be involved this project will be very impressive.\nWe want to help fight Ebola, can we count on you to support this cause?\nYou should create a fundraiser and donate all the proceeds to Ebola research/public awareness.\nhttp://kryptokit.com/rush-fundraiser/\nhttp://rushwallet.com/\nThanks for that lead, it will be considered.   Are you in contact with the site owners?\n", "author": "Armis Hero Member Offline Activity: 588 Merit: 500 Inaugural PICISI Sponsor "}, {"date": "2014-10-02 04:10:26", "content": "Ebola is heavy in the news, EMC2 is considering leading a campaign to making a public donation to fight Ebola --  via Ebola research, public awareness, and scientific education.\nWe need to know many people are willing to contribute to the campaign, we want you to pledge your support.   We are specifically looking for people to pledge currency, volunteer time, retweets, facebook, reddit, IRC, etc posts, and assistance with a crowd-funding campaign.   If enough people pledge to do something great in this regard we will turn the best wishes into action.\nIn addition to the good it will do for the cause, it will also provide some positive exposure for the cryptocurrency community, we know that various media inside and outside of the CC community will want to pick-up the story.\nDepending on the number of people who would want to be involved this project will be very impressive.\nWe want to help fight Ebola, can we count on you to support this cause?\nI think your title is somewhat misleading.

(phase 2) before walmart/7-11 decides to offer discounts because payment processing is cheaper and they are getting free publicity from bitcoin.\nthe whole \"user adoption\" for everyday joe bloggs is not the point we are at. so be patient. have a cup of coffee and realise that bitcoin is not a fully grown up currency it is still a toddler, yes its volatile, having temper tantrums as toddlers do but its still crawling around and learning to walk. not yet ready to run.\nyour mindset is stuck on a very narrow vein of what bitcoins potential is, a vein pumping money around. bitcoin is far bigger, it has muscles it needs to flex and needs to show more movements of these muscles and not only the movements of money through its veins.\nim not sure i can make it any clearer. but you seem to think that bitcoin is a 100metre sprint and you want to be the one running home back to your comfort zone.\nbitcoin my friend is a triathlon.\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-10-02 01:58:49", "content": "I am not from the USA so I cant comment on coinbase.\nWell you certainly did make a comment about coinbase before.... now you are admitting to making up facts?\nI just went to circle.com and tried it myself.

Imagine if all the infrastructure is in place and all the merchants accept bitcoin - why then will the consumer adopt it if there is no incentive?\nagain bitcoins use is NOT meant to simply start with a fiat wage, convert to bitcoin to then instantly spend the same day for discounts.\nbitcoin is NOT a loyalty store/card which you can top-up.\nget passed the mindset of buy bitcoin in the morning to spend in the afternoon.\nyour logic and mindset is like saying why would americans buy euros simply because a 7-11 in america starts accepting euro's.\nPLEASE learn what bitcoin is about, learn all the benefits. there are atleast 20 of them, there is reason a 7-11 store would discount a product simply because they accept euro.\nonce you get passed the mindset of that. and learn all the other possibilities of bitcoins you will see it.\nit seems to me you just want to tempt others to buy coin from you under some pretense that you can con others with promises of discounts.. without truly explaining what bitcoin is and explain all the intricacies and benefits.\nThat my friend is not what bitcoin is about. please please please take some time and look at what other benefits bitcoin is, starting with why you are even on this forum. what benefits of bitcoin tempted you and made you think bitcoin was worth looking into, as i know it was not promises of discounts, as there are none,. and never should be. so look deep into yourself and come to the true desire of bitcoin, by remembering what brought you here in the first place.\nthen learn the other true benefits\nThis is what we call a straw man argument. When did I ever say that BTC is supposed to be a like a store card? I know that BTC is supposed to replace fiat. But it will not happen if there are no incentives. You can't keep saying \"let us get to phase 3 first\" etc etc. Even in phase 3 you need incentives. You cant just hope and pray that phase 3 will have the right incentives appear from magic. We need to start thinking about how to make these incentives.

Don't put the cart before the horse. The effect before the cause.\nYes, because their \"safe\" 401ks worked out so well. It's a hedge. They get paid a small % in btc as a part of their portfolio. As adoption grows, as the infrastructure grows, so does their incentive to accept a higher % of their wage in btc. it slowly transfers from a high risk investment/hedge to the norm. Not only do they begin to greatly reap the benefits of using btc in a closed loop, but their btc is likely appreciating greatly while we drive towards critical mass. It gets particularily interesting when it hits that oh so important tipping point.\nThis is a nice answer. Finally someone answers with something sensible and not just empty rhetoric.\nYou have a good plan. Promote BTC so that it gets a good image and slowly get people to adopt it. The promotion would be the key here. We would have to state the benefits such as no inflation. In this way the users go into it thinking that it is for the future. This wont get many average guys to adopt it, but some of the more wealthy would. I.e. promote btc as an investment.\n", "author": "cafucafucafu Hero Member Offline Activity: 658 Merit: 501 For Lady and Mister! Enjoy Bazista!
