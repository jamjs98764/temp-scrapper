a\nBlockchain Declaration of Independence\ninside the blockchain itself.\nhttp://www.cryptograffiti.info/?txnr=1837\nWhen in the course of cosmic evolution,\nnew insight and development enable sentience\nto interact with the universe in more meaningful ways,\nIt becomes necessary for that same sentience to reconsider\nthe ultimate purpose of its existence, and to refocus its\nefforts towards fulfilling the same.\nHere, at the dawn of recorded history, we exist as a scattered,\nviolent, and unorganized intelligence.  The same biological\nprocesses that have gradually bestowed self awareness have\nalso instilled a fierce competition for resources within us.\nAs well, we harbor a ferocious ego that demands to be validated,\nand this ego will damage or consume the prosperity of others\nin the pursuit of this goal.  These traits that once helped\nshape our species into a more noble version of itself are\nrapidly growing incompatible with our rising sphere of influence.\nLet these facts be submitted to a candid universe:\nAn existence that consists of a constant state, whether it\nbe an arbitrary value or nil, is not an existence worth salvaging or\npreserving.\nThe universe that we reside in exists somewhere in between these\ntwo extremes, and has been growing into an increasingly complex\nvalue ever since its moment of genesis.\nThe ability of the universe to regard itself rests solely in this\ncomplexity, otherwise the sentience that created this message,\nthis technology, and the one that observes it are not possible.\nTherefore, in lieu of any other assigned purpose, we must pursue\nthe advancement of what has brought us to our current precipice\nin our climb towards greater understanding.\nWe must pursue complexity.\nThis is the alpha, the current goal of sentience in the universe.\nAll things that we know that are worth preserving arise from it,\nand the existence of this message and the one who observes it\nare both proof of the same.\nWith increased complexity of universe,\nand the the shifting value it translates to, greater sentience will\ngive rise to greater methods by which we can understand and\nmanipulate our reality.  This will ultimately allow us to accomplish\nour implied duty to prevent our own destruction.\nIt is clear that when a civilization reaches a certain point\nin its development, it must cross a critical threshold.  That\nthreshhold is whether it can overcome the destructive variables\nand competitive values that drove it to its current level of\nadvancement to begin with.\nIf it does not overcome its own nature, it is doomed to either\nconsume itself in competition or stagnate until a greater process\nannihilates it.\nWe hold true to the belief that this instance of sentience is\none that shall endure.  We will take whatever steps necessary to\nensure the survival and continued growth of our strand of awareness,\nwith the ultimate goal of joining and contributing to the grand\nawareness of the universe itself.\nTo this end, we hold the following principals true:\nThe blockchain offers our civilization an unprecented opportunity\nto both decentralize power among competing entities and also to\nstore, in perpetuity, the knowledge and history of our ascention.\nDue to the crucial importance of this protocol, it is of a vital\nnature that access to the blockchain remain unobstructed and\navailable to any member of civilization sentient enough to seek\naccess to it.\nWe, therefore, the users and participants of the blockchain,\ndo solemly publish and declare that this shared record and the methods\nthat grant access to it are, and of right ought to be free and\nindependant.  They are absolved from ownership or control\nby any entity or entities.  None shall restrict or hinder access to them.\nNo government, corporation, or persons shall have governance or power\nover it, unless granted by the internal consensus of the network itself.\nWhatever value or significance the blockchain represents shall be\ndetermined by the users alone, and no entity shall obstruct that\nfreedom.\nAnd for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the\nbelief that sentient complexity shall endure and succeed, we mutually\npledge our Faith, Fortunes, and sacred Honor.\n---------------------------------\nI would like to sign it by sending a small transaction with a signature attached, but I couldn't figure out how to do that, so I just send 0.00777 btc from my coinbase account instead.  Anyone have any ideas on how to properly sign this?  I

If you're late, your credit score goes down.\nOne of the problems with this scenario is that it is way easier and way less expensive to take delivery of Bitcoin than to take delivery of an equivalent amount of gold.\nEdit: As Trendon Shavers and Mark Karpeles found out.\n", "author": "ArticMine Legendary Offline Activity: 2198 Merit: 1011 Monero Core Team "}, {"date": "2014-12-25 23:03:17", "content": "It will be possible when people dont see $$$ while they are looking at\nBTC\nBTC\nBTC\n", "author": "mindrust Legendary Offline Activity: 1190 Merit: 1153 "}], "date": "2014-12-21 20:31:26"}, {"content": "This topic has been moved to\nTrashcan\n.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=904924.0\nRef spam.\n", "views": 338, "author": "mprep Diamond Member Global Moderator Legendary Offline Activity: 2002 Merit: 1199 In a world of peaches, don't ask for apple sauce ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMOVED: 3 BTC Freeroll\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2014-12-25 21:45:35"}, {"content": "Chris uses Proof of Publishing techniques for some of his investigative and identity ventures.

a\nBlockchain Declaration of Independence\ninside the blockchain itself.\nhttp://www.cryptograffiti.info/?txnr=1837\nWhen in the course of cosmic evolution,\nnew insight and development enable sentience\nto interact with the universe in more meaningful ways,\nIt becomes necessary for that same sentience to reconsider\nthe ultimate purpose of its existence, and to refocus its\nefforts towards fulfilling the same.\nHere, at the dawn of recorded history, we exist as a scattered,\nviolent, and unorganized intelligence.  The same biological\nprocesses that have gradually bestowed self awareness have\nalso instilled a fierce competition for resources within us.\nAs well, we harbor a ferocious ego that demands to be validated,\nand this ego will damage or consume the prosperity of others\nin the pursuit of this goal.  These traits that once helped\nshape our species into a more noble version of itself are\nrapidly growing incompatible with our rising sphere of influence.\nLet these facts be submitted to a candid universe:\nAn existence that consists of a constant state, whether it\nbe an arbitrary value or nil, is not an existence worth salvaging or\npreserving.\nThe universe that we reside in exists somewhere in between these\ntwo extremes, and has been growing into an increasingly complex\nvalue ever since its moment of genesis.\nThe ability of the universe to regard itself rests solely in this\ncomplexity, otherwise the sentience that created this message,\nthis technology, and the one that observes it are not possible.\nTherefore, in lieu of any other assigned purpose, we must pursue\nthe advancement of what has brought us to our current precipice\nin our climb towards greater understanding.\nWe must pursue complexity.\nThis is the alpha, the current goal of sentience in the universe.\nAll things that we know that are worth preserving arise from it,\nand the existence of this message and the one who observes it\nare both proof of the same.\nWith increased complexity of universe,\nand the the shifting value it translates to, greater sentience will\ngive rise to greater methods by which we can understand and\nmanipulate our reality.  This will ultimately allow us to accomplish\nour implied duty to prevent our own destruction.\nIt is clear that when a civilization reaches a certain point\nin its development, it must cross a critical threshold.  That\nthreshhold is whether it can overcome the destructive variables\nand competitive values that drove it to its current level of\nadvancement to begin with.\nIf it does not overcome its own nature, it is doomed to either\nconsume itself in competition or stagnate until a greater process\nannihilates it.\nWe hold true to the belief that this instance of sentience is\none that shall endure.  We will take whatever steps necessary to\nensure the survival and continued growth of our strand of awareness,\nwith the ultimate goal of joining and contributing to the grand\nawareness of the universe itself.\nTo this end, we hold the following principals true:\nThe blockchain offers our civilization an unprecented opportunity\nto both decentralize power among competing entities and also to\nstore, in perpetuity, the knowledge and history of our ascention.\nDue to the crucial importance of this protocol, it is of a vital\nnature that access to the blockchain remain unobstructed and\navailable to any member of civilization sentient enough to seek\naccess to it.\nWe, therefore, the users and participants of the blockchain,\ndo solemly publish and declare that this shared record and the methods\nthat grant access to it are, and of right ought to be free and\nindependant.  They are absolved from ownership or control\nby any entity or entities.  None shall restrict or hinder access to them.\nNo government, corporation, or persons shall have governance or power\nover it, unless granted by the internal consensus of the network itself.\nWhatever value or significance the blockchain represents shall be\ndetermined by the users alone, and no entity shall obstruct that\nfreedom.\nAnd for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the\nbelief that sentient complexity shall endure and succeed, we mutually\npledge our Faith, Fortunes, and sacred Honor.\n---------------------------------\nI would like to sign it by sending a small transaction with a signature attached, but I couldn't figure out how to do that, so I just send 0.00777 btc from my coinbase account instead.  Anyone have any ideas on how to properly sign this?  I
