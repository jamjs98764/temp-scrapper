First of all, I fail to see the why people have this perception that having no banks and a completely deregulated monetary system would be entirely good. Banks are just like any other service, they exist because there is demand for them and that demand comes from the fact people need a place to store their wealth as well as go to as a means of finding capital for investment. Government policies exist to try and maintain steady growth within the economy and reduce the swinginess of business cycles. While you might not agree with the way governments choose to go about with their policy - most of their aims are sound.\nFor example, imagine if Greece had no means of being bailed out because money was entirely deregulated. You would have chronic unemployment, a significant reduction in quality of life (as no one can afford services/goods) and probably eventually starve out the population without some sort of humanitarian aid from other countries.

Seeing someone in pleasure &gt; seeing someone in pain.  Maybe the problem is if you have some kinda crazy \"anarchy\" world people cannot find sympathy for other different kinds of people if they become too different and we all kill each other? Although we find sympathy for animals so dont think so...\nAs regards Greece, lf the people own the land and are free to trade how they wish they both have the control and motivation to preserve quality of life.  With government running the show they lose direct control.   What happened with Greece exactly? seems like their people gave other people power to make decisions and these other people made bad/unlucky decisions? or did Greece suddenly turn non compatible for human life?  If not those then must of been that Greece were unlucky?   (excuse my ignorance)\nLastly yeah im not ok with people going around stabbing people randomly for no reason, i would hope to keep donation style gov to police this, if this is not possible then yeah i guess more brainstorming needed before we change to mad max apocalypse\n", "author": "BitCoinNutJob Legendary Offline Activity: 1162 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-09-30 13:05:16", "content": "To think about it, there are scammers that have more than the rich(TF, karpeles).

And the following (and partly caused by it) WWII?\nI don't think we need an in-depth analysis to show that the wealth creation due to bitcoin financial services will be dwarfed by the wealth represented by the monetary value of bitcoin. Let me try another route.\nThe bitcoin financial services are the arteries through which bitcoin monetary value flows. Yes, it takes capital - human and resources - to create these arteries. In the process of this creation, the value of the resulting financial services will -- if intelligently implemented -- exceed the value of the human and resources capital that went into their creation. IOW, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. It is this difference that is the wealth created by the bitcoin financial services. This wealth will be earned and enjoyed by the people that create these services.\nBut all this is for naught if there is not a much greater pool of bitcoin, that will flow through these arteries.\nIn any scenario where bitcoin 'succeeds' in any meaningful measure, there will be a much greater number of people who passively use bitcoin -- to store value and/or to use as a medium of exchange -- than the number of people who create the aforementioned arteries. These passive users of bitcoin, should they HODL more than spend in the early days (years), will be the beneficiaries of a great transfer of wealth from fiat holders.\nIf the bitcoin wealth owned by the passive users does not completely dominate the created wealth of the bitcoin financial services buildout, then the entire system is woefully inefficient. IOW, it has failed spectacularly in its claimed mission to be a money.\nI rather think it fail succeed spectacularly. I will harbor no guilt about the fact that I was early to detect the seeming inevitability of this great transfer of wealth.\nYour fiat doom scenarios, while instructive, seem to me to be tangential (or maybe I have not yet seen the relevance). These problems are all self-inflicted by the fiat system, which repeatedly confuses an increase in the currency used to measure wealth (ignoring the subsequent devaluation) for an increase in actual wealth.\n", "author": "jbreher Legendary Offline Activity: 2142 Merit: 1089 lose: unfind ... loose: untight "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 21:45:58", "content": "You seem to imply that the monetary value of Bitcoin will never be much greater than the sum of the value of the financial services of the network. I disagree. In any shoot the moon scenario whatsoever, the monetary value will completely dwarf the financial services value.\nApart from bubble crashes and wars we can try to estimate the other component of bitcoin financial services value: regular (in/de)flation.\nFiat inflation is around 3%. What would be bitcoin inflation? After a couple of halvings bitcoin emission will reach 2%pa. But if it replaces fiat, the demand will grow at a rate of world GDP, which is, say 7%. So bitcoin purchasing power will grow at about 5% after following halvings going to 7%. That is instead a dollar that goes down 3% pa, user will have bitcoin that goes up 7% pa. That's 10% pa difference. Which capital gives such profit? For an average person real, inflation adjusted investment is 5%. 10/5=2. That is it's the same as if for each dollar you exchange for bitcoin you would get, as a bonus, two \"virtual\" dollars that give you 5%pa each.\ntl;dr: At the switch from fiat to bitcoin, wealth created will be twice as big as wealth transferred.\n(And it's just a part of total Bitcoin payment system value).\nI disagree. You seem to be conflating currency movements with wealth movements. Currency is just a flexible measure of wealth. Yes, the bitcoin holders will enjoy a comparative purchasing power advantage over the fiat holders. But the amount of actual wealth (e.g. tangible goods, services, resources, and other capital) is not affected by such relative currency movements.\nDue to this, your example is an example of wealth transfer, not of wealth creation.\n", "author": "jbreher Legendary Offline Activity: 2142 Merit: 1089 lose: unfind ... loose: untight "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 21:47:30", "content": "it still depends on the people who own the currency.

This wealth will be earned and enjoyed by the people that create these services.\nBut all this is for naught if there is not a much greater pool of bitcoin, that will flow through these arteries.\nYou seem to assume that value must be if not equal, but at least close to costs. Which is not the case. If a multimillion jet cannot fly it's value may fall 100-fold, to the price of scrap metal. But we can recover original value by replacing a 10-cents fuse.\nOur financial system and our whole economy is such non-flying jet. It's very inefficient and wasteful.\nAnd Bitcoin is the 10-cents fuse that can fix the multimillion jet.\nIt can (partly, at least) fix our economy's inefficiency and thus increase it's total value. The total value of the whole world economy. And the value of bitcoin payment system should be measured by this increase, rather than by costs of creating it.\nHow can the value grow if amount of \"tangible goods, services, resources, and other capital\" is not increased?  By more efficient allocation of the same resources. By decreasing waste of this resources. And by faster growth of these resources. If your capital can produce 6% instead of 3%, it's the same as having two capitals for the price of one.\nThis is the new wealth created by the bitcoin and the major part of this wealth will not be in the hands of early adopters, because worth of all resources is much bigger than amount of all money. Therefore the benefits of bitcoins will be enjoyed by the whole population, rather than by small circle of hodlers. That's exactly why people will switch to bitcoin: because it gives them some value. Every single person that'll switch to bitcoin, will do it because of an extra value that that bitcoin will give to her.\ntl;dr; Bitcoin is 10-cents fuse that fixes multimillion jet.

It will be the first time that Bitcoin advocacy organizations are consulted by the Committee during this 10th day of testimony.\nThe Bitcoin Foundation Canada will be represented by Jillian Friedman, attorney and Chief Legal Officer and Guillaume Babin-Tremblay, founding member and Treasurer.

The Bitcoin Alliance of Canada will be represented by Michael Perklin, Director and Steward Hoegner, General Counsel.\nThe Senate of Canada, although a component of the Parliament of Canada, does not hold the same legislative influence as the House of Commons or its American homonym. It can however be compared to the House of Lords in the United Kingdom.

Students who use bitcoin will now be able to purchase food and goods at almost all locations on the Tech campus.\nGeorgia Tech was founded in 1885 and remains one of the most prestigious public universities in the United States. The university has contributed a great deal of research as well as many notable graduates to the field of applied technology over the years. It continues to engage itself with technological progress through its leading role in university adoption of bitcoin through an innovative deal brokered by IMG, the universitys multimedia rights partner.\nAs the key to campus life on Georgia Tech, the BuzzCard will be an important interface for student bitcoin use. Yellow Jackets fans will also be able to easily and quickly purchase snacks and drinks at Bobby Dodd Stadium with the worlds fastest payment method. These new bitcoin venues, along with bitcoin wallet provider Pheevas announcement of a unique Jacketwallet\" for Georgia Tech, hold promise for the role which digital currency may come to play in student life.\nWe look forward to working with BitPay to make bitcoin a viable payment option for our students and fans, Georgia Tech AD Mike Bobinski said. At Georgia Tech, we are always looking to lead in innovative ways, and this partnership with BitPay gives us an opportunity to do so by integrating this new technology at a sports venue and in the daily lives of our students.\nRead the full press release at:\nhttp://cryptocoinchronicle.com/2014/10/georgia-tech-bitpay-announce-bitcoin-integration-stadium-student-buzzcards/\n", "views": 953, "author": "Emperion Jr. Member Offline Activity: 44 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGeorgia Tech and BitPay Announce Bitcoin Integration for Stadium and Student Buz\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-10-01 15:32:41", "content": "Please stop with the good news.  The price is going to fall to $300 now\n", "author": "blatchcorn Sr. Member Offline Activity: 546 Merit: 251 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 15:46:11", "content": "Great news very important to involve student population.\n", "author": "itsAj Hero Member Offline Activity: 588 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 16:41:07", "content": "Great to see my alma mater taking the lead and partnering with BitPay.  Looking forward to trying out the POS devices at the stadium!\n", "author": "djjacket Hero Member Offline Activity: 759 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 17:42:50", "content": "Georgia Tech alumni here....

There is no national infrastructure in place to charge electric cars, people are used to gas vehicles and are not willing to switch over mainly because everything is set up for gas cars.\nI was involved in the electric car community in the late 90s and it was much like the early days of Bitcoin. People converting their cars to electric, complaining about the big companies ignoring the benefits, trying to figure out the chicken and egg problem of getting charging stations up all over the place to charge non-existent electric cars that weren't being created because there aren't charging stations all over the place.\nThen the hybrids started using some of the electric car technology. They tried to make it as close to a gas car as they could, hiding as much of the electric aspect from the user as they could since that is what they were familiar with. Prius used it to get better gas mileage using recharging brakes and the efficiency of the electric motor at low speeds and quick acceleration. The first ones took some time for people to get used to, there was a distrust of electric cars and a knowledge gap. Some hard core enthusiasts added more batteries and converted the Prius into a plug in hybrid showing Toyota how it could be done, begging for them to implement the plug in aspect so you could drive short distances without the need for gas. The first plug in vehicles were confusing to most consumers, die hard electric people were enthusiastic, commercials had to be made to show that it was simple and not all electric (only optional).\nTesla used the concept of focusing on a community that would be willing to adopt a fully electric car while making it cool, they went after the sports car industry where people are willing to put up with some mechanical issues or comfort for something that's fast, looks good and is new. They used the initially high priced vehicles to fund their more consumer oriented vehicles and have been working to put the infrastructure in place for electric vehicles across the country. This should make it easier for future electric car adoption and allow for more companies to start putting out fully electric cars.\nBitcoin is in the early stages of the hybrid phase. Companies are willing to use the good parts of it to help their fiat business, trying not to scare their consumers with the technological aspects of Bitcoin that they may be afraid of. The hybridization is not the most efficient and does not use the full utility of Bitcoin but is what the consumer is currently willing to accept.\nWe need a Tesla equivalent that can focus on a small focused part of the economy that is most willing to use it and make it look cool and then turn around and use that to grow and set up the infrastructure for the pure Bitcoin economy.\n", "views": 1640, "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin is like the electric car\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-10-01 09:38:53", "content": "I think this analogy( bitcoin is like an electric car) is pretty apt to bitcoin and in more ways than the OP realise.\n", "author": "Ruthful Full Member Offline Activity: 195 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 12:51:53", "content": "No offense Elwar, but your analogy is shit.\nIf fiat is the car, than bitcoin is the teleporter.\nBitcoin can be in two (or 42) places in the world at the same time.\nThat's teleportation.\n", "author": "Beliathon Hero Member Offline Activity: 784 Merit: 1000 https://youtu.be/PZm8TTLR2NU "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 13:02:17", "content": "No offense Elwar, but your analogy is shit.\nIf fiat is the car, than bitcoin is the teleporter.\nBitcoin can be in two (or 42) places in the world at the same time.\nThat's teleportation.\nTeleportation would face many struggles of adoption as well.\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 13:18:32", "content": "No offense Elwar, but your analogy is shit.\nIf fiat is the car, than bitcoin is the teleporter.\nBitcoin can be in two (or 42) places in the world at the same time.\nThat's teleportation.\nexcept teleportation doesn't exist.\nI think his analogy is good.  BTC sounds really great in theory, but the problems and difficulty of use/obtaining it prevent a barrier to most people.  Yes its easy (once you learn how) and costs basically nothing to send btc worldwide, but companies I'm sure are taking note of this, and working on solutions on how to do this with fiat.  BTC is a great technology, same with electric cars, but they still trace back to fossil fuels somehow.\n", "author": "jcoin200 Hero Member Offline Activity: 504 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 13:20:00", "content": "No offense Elwar, but your analogy is shit.\nIf fiat is the car, than bitcoin is the teleporter.\nBitcoin can be in two (or 42) places in the world at the same time.\nThat's teleportation.\nActually his analogy is quite true.Yours on the other hand borders on fantasy..\n", "author": "Ruthful Full Member Offline Activity: 195 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 13:24:54", "content": "No offense Elwar, but your analogy is shit.\nIf fiat is the car, than bitcoin is the teleporter.\nBitcoin can be in two (or 42) places in the world at the same time.\nThat's teleportation.\nYou seem to be understanding the metaphor quite literally.

(kinda contradictory oxymoron but you get what im trying to say in this whole context? bitcoin seems stable enough)\nI'm not sure I necessarily agree. First of all, I fail to see the why people have this perception that having no banks and a completely deregulated monetary system would be entirely good. Banks are just like any other service, they exist because there is demand for them and that demand comes from the fact people need a place to store their wealth as well as go to as a means of finding capital for investment. Government policies exist to try and maintain steady growth within the economy and reduce the swinginess of business cycles. While you might not agree with the way governments choose to go about with their policy - most of their aims are sound.\nFor example, imagine if Greece had no means of being bailed out because money was entirely deregulated. You would have chronic unemployment, a significant reduction in quality of life (as no one can afford services/goods) and probably eventually starve out the population without some sort of humanitarian aid from other countries. If anything that's even worse than what we have now. I don't care about being free if I have to have a hole in my stomach and die because of it because I don't have food to eat.\nSecondly, whose to say you aren't currently the master of your own destiny at the current time/status quo? Aside from preventing things which hurt society as a whole, the way most democracy's are set up means they allow the freedom to do nearly anything. The only reason you can't go out and stab people because you feel like it is because it negatively impacts others. You have the freedom to anything else you like really.\nAnd if you wouldn't mind clarifying - are you wanting to not have a government (which would be anarchy and complete chaos) or just no government intervention in monetary policy?\n", "author": "Light Hero Member Offline Activity: 728 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-09-30 12:55:23", "content": "-snip-\nNext...

First of all, I fail to see the why people have this perception that having no banks and a completely deregulated monetary system would be entirely good. Banks are just like any other service, they exist because there is demand for them and that demand comes from the fact people need a place to store their wealth as well as go to as a means of finding capital for investment. Government policies exist to try and maintain steady growth within the economy and reduce the swinginess of business cycles. While you might not agree with the way governments choose to go about with their policy - most of their aims are sound.\nFor example, imagine if Greece had no means of being bailed out because money was entirely deregulated. You would have chronic unemployment, a significant reduction in quality of life (as no one can afford services/goods) and probably eventually starve out the population without some sort of humanitarian aid from other countries. If anything that's even worse than what we have now. I don't care about being free if I have to have a hole in my stomach and die because of it because I don't have food to eat.\nSecondly, whose to say you aren't currently the master of your own destiny at the current time/status quo? Aside from preventing things which hurt society as a whole, the way most democracy's are set up means they allow the freedom to do nearly anything. The only reason you can't go out and stab people because you feel like it is because it negatively impacts others. You have the freedom to anything else you like really.\nAnd if you wouldn't mind clarifying - are you wanting to not have a government (which would be anarchy and complete chaos) or just no government intervention in monetary policy?\nI can only offer my bias opinion really because right/wrong/good/bad seems impossible to know objectively.  To clarify im thinking i want no government involvement in monetary system.  Im keen to keep some kind of less powerful gov perhaps some kind of donation based regulation authority.\nThe inefficiency of the banking system comes at a cost even if we initially chose this system out of demand, do we get enough back as a society for that cost at this point?   The demand for banking in current format could be reassessed now technology has shown us improvements.  Many financial sector workers could be doing other things.   Maybe bitcoin needs more time to prove itself?\nGovernment polices aims are meant with good intention im sure but if you have more individual direct control to environment via voting with your wallet you relate better imo, you have motivation to relate when your decisions actually count.  People/life is too complex to have a 100 million person sized tribes all following the same ways.\nCommon denominators in humans seem to be we are all drawn towards pleasure and try to avoid pain.  We also all seem to display sympathy. Seeing someone in pleasure &gt; seeing someone in pain.  Maybe the problem is if you have some kinda crazy \"anarchy\" world people cannot find sympathy for other different kinds of people if they become too different and we all kill each other? Although we find sympathy for animals so dont think so...\nAs regards Greece, lf the people own the land and are free to trade how they wish they both have the control and motivation to preserve quality of life.  With government running the show they lose direct control.   What happened with Greece exactly? seems like their people gave other people power to make decisions and these other people made bad/unlucky decisions? or did Greece suddenly turn non compatible for human life?  If not those then must of been that Greece were unlucky?   (excuse my ignorance)\nLastly yeah im not ok with people going around stabbing people randomly for no reason, i would hope to keep donation style gov to police this, if this is not possible then yeah i guess more brainstorming needed before we change to mad max apocalypse\n", "author": "BitCoinNutJob Legendary Offline Activity: 1162 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2014-09-30 13:05:16", "content": "To think about it, there are scammers that have more than the rich(TF, karpeles).

But we can recover original value by replacing a 10-cents fuse.\nOur financial system and our whole economy is such non-flying jet. It's very inefficient and wasteful.\nAnd Bitcoin is the 10-cents fuse that can fix the multimillion jet.\nIt can (partly, at least) fix our economy's inefficiency and thus increase it's total value. The total value of the whole world economy. And the value of bitcoin payment system should be measured by this increase, rather than by costs of creating it.\nHow can the value grow if amount of \"tangible goods, services, resources, and other capital\" is not increased?  By more efficient allocation of the same resources. By decreasing waste of this resources. And by faster growth of these resources. If your capital can produce 6% instead of 3%, it's the same as having two capitals for the price of one.\nThis is the new wealth created by the bitcoin and the major part of this wealth will not be in the hands of early adopters, because worth of all resources is much bigger than amount of all money.

It will be the first time that Bitcoin advocacy organizations are consulted by the Committee during this 10th day of testimony.\nThe Bitcoin Foundation Canada will be represented by Jillian Friedman, attorney and Chief Legal Officer and Guillaume Babin-Tremblay, founding member and Treasurer.

It can however be compared to the House of Lords in the United Kingdom.

There is no national infrastructure in place to charge electric cars, people are used to gas vehicles and are not willing to switch over mainly because everything is set up for gas cars.\nI was involved in the electric car community in the late 90s and it was much like the early days of Bitcoin. People converting their cars to electric, complaining about the big companies ignoring the benefits, trying to figure out the chicken and egg problem of getting charging stations up all over the place to charge non-existent electric cars that weren't being created because there aren't charging stations all over the place.\nThen the hybrids started using some of the electric car technology. They tried to make it as close to a gas car as they could, hiding as much of the electric aspect from the user as they could since that is what they were familiar with. Prius used it to get better gas mileage using recharging brakes and the efficiency of the electric motor at low speeds and quick acceleration. The first ones took some time for people to get used to, there was a distrust of electric cars and a knowledge gap. Some hard core enthusiasts added more batteries and converted the Prius into a plug in hybrid showing Toyota how it could be done, begging for them to implement the plug in aspect so you could drive short distances without the need for gas. The first plug in vehicles were confusing to most consumers, die hard electric people were enthusiastic, commercials had to be made to show that it was simple and not all electric (only optional).\nTesla used the concept of focusing on a community that would be willing to adopt a fully electric car while making it cool, they went after the sports car industry where people are willing to put up with some mechanical issues or comfort for something that's fast, looks good and is new. They used the initially high priced vehicles to fund their more consumer oriented vehicles and have been working to put the infrastructure in place for electric vehicles across the country. This should make it easier for future electric car adoption and allow for more companies to start putting out fully electric cars.\nBitcoin is in the early stages of the hybrid phase. Companies are willing to use the good parts of it to help their fiat business, trying not to scare their consumers with the technological aspects of Bitcoin that they may be afraid of. The hybridization is not the most efficient and does not use the full utility of Bitcoin but is what the consumer is currently willing to accept.\nWe need a Tesla equivalent that can focus on a small focused part of the economy that is most willing to use it and make it look cool and then turn around and use that to grow and set up the infrastructure for the pure Bitcoin economy.\n", "views": 1640, "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin is like the electric car\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-10-01 09:38:53", "content": "I think this analogy( bitcoin is like an electric car) is pretty apt to bitcoin and in more ways than the OP realise.\n", "author": "Ruthful Full Member Offline Activity: 195 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 12:51:53", "content": "No offense Elwar, but your analogy is shit.\nIf fiat is the car, than bitcoin is the teleporter.\nBitcoin can be in two (or 42) places in the world at the same time.\nThat's teleportation.\n", "author": "Beliathon Hero Member Offline Activity: 784 Merit: 1000 https://youtu.be/PZm8TTLR2NU "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 13:02:17", "content": "No offense Elwar, but your analogy is shit.\nIf fiat is the car, than bitcoin is the teleporter.\nBitcoin can be in two (or 42) places in the world at the same time.\nThat's teleportation.\nTeleportation would face many struggles of adoption as well.\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 13:18:32", "content": "No offense Elwar, but your analogy is shit.\nIf fiat is the car, than bitcoin is the teleporter.\nBitcoin can be in two (or 42) places in the world at the same time.\nThat's teleportation.\nexcept teleportation doesn't exist.\nI think his analogy is good.  BTC sounds really great in theory, but the problems and difficulty of use/obtaining it prevent a barrier to most people.  Yes its easy (once you learn how) and costs basically nothing to send btc worldwide, but companies I'm sure are taking note of this, and working on solutions on how to do this with fiat.  BTC is a great technology, same with electric cars, but they still trace back to fossil fuels somehow.\n", "author": "jcoin200 Hero Member Offline Activity: 504 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 13:20:00", "content": "No offense Elwar, but your analogy is shit.\nIf fiat is the car, than bitcoin is the teleporter.\nBitcoin can be in two (or 42) places in the world at the same time.\nThat's teleportation.\nActually his analogy is quite true.Yours on the other hand borders on fantasy..\n", "author": "Ruthful Full Member Offline Activity: 195 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 13:24:54", "content": "No offense Elwar, but your analogy is shit.\nIf fiat is the car, than bitcoin is the teleporter.\nBitcoin can be in two (or 42) places in the world at the same time.\nThat's teleportation.\nYou seem to be understanding the metaphor quite literally.

Zerocash is the one that is is improved.  Zerocoin is the one that had some early hiccups and essentially was an early codebase that led to some more brain wanderings and things like Zerocash, which really has not been released.  Developers are (by github user ID) primarily these:\nhttps://github.com/matthewdgreen\nhttps://github.com/imichaelmiers\nhttps://github.com/ChristinaLGarman\nYou can see more on Zerocash here:\nhttp://zerocash-project.org/\nAnd there was an announcement on it here, indirectly indicating that the release date for Zerocash is anticipated to be November or December of 2014:\nhttps://twitter.com/secparam/status/468784402558771200\nWhich pegs the beginning of 2015 as something of a new era in the relationship of the individual to the \"state.\"\nCheers.\n", "author": "ABISprotocol Sr. Member Offline Activity: 278 Merit: 250 ABISprotocol on Gist "}, {"date": "2014-09-30 17:07:43", "content": "TO ALL THOSE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS TOPIC.\nI just want to say thank you to all those that contributed all the different methods that I can use to connect to the blockchain.\nI will be making note of the different methods.\nIf anybody has any other ideas please add it here, before the topic eventually dissappears way down the topic list and other users may not find all these helpfull suggestions.\nThank you all for your time\n", "author": "chat Jr. Member Offline Activity: 53 Merit: 0 follow me "}, {"date": "2014-10-01 19:26:38", "content": "TO ALL THOSE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS TOPIC.\nI just want to say thank you to all those that contributed all the different methods that I can use to connect to the blockchain.\nI will be making note of the different methods.\nIf anybody has any other ideas please add it here, before the topic eventually dissappears way down the topic list and other users may not find all these helpfull suggestions.\nThank you all for your time\nI'am really a newbie on those stuff , but since it's Peer to Peer , ISP can block Ports or shit to prevent us from connecting with the network , nop ?\n", "author": "Madness Hero Member Offline Activity: 644 Merit: 500 My goal is becaming a billionaire.

Their are a ton of services that allow for this- Blockchain.info, Toshi, much more\nhttps://blockchain.info/pushtx\nhttps://blockchain.info/decode-tx\nhttps://toshi.io/docs/#relay-transaction\nHere is some good information:\nhttp://www.righto.com/2014/02/bitcoins-hard-way-using-raw-bitcoin.html\nDon't bother using Python's Random function as a source for address generation, it is not cryptographically strong.\n(Remember that one user who used to post youtube videos of him brute forcing wallets?, he was probably just generating addresses using Pythons random till he found one with a balance greater than 0 that someone used)\nThis is true, however in order to effectively be able to use any of the above services you need to know which inputs are unspent on a private key that you control. In order to know this information, you essentially need to have access to the blockchain in some way. (or at the very least have access to the blockchain up to the point that you have received the last input that you wish to spend)\nSomeone could easily connect to a block explorer via TOR to effectively solve this problem. Also connecting to a block explorer would make it so the government would not be able to block a specific port that connects to the rest of the network as they would generally connect to this via HTML\n", "author": "blumangroup Sr. Member Offline Activity: 350 Merit: 250 'Slow and steady wins the race' "}], "date": "2014-09-19 10:28:34"}, {"content": "No Double GST For Bitcoin\n", "views": 753, "author": "Coiner1 Newbie Offline Activity: 5 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAustralians: If you have a website or logo, please comment on double GST\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2014-10-02 00:19:37"}]}
