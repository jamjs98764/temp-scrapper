Say you have already obtained those precious coins. First thing you'll do is to make sure that you are protected from different exploitations and attacks. If you managed to do this, you'll feel relieved. But there are other things a bitcoin user must know aside from protecting his/her assets--spending it and how to do it without doing some mistakes.

Say you have already obtained those precious coins. First thing you'll do is to make sure that you are protected from different exploitations and attacks. If you managed to do this, you'll feel relieved. But there are other things a bitcoin user must know aside from protecting his/her assets--spending it and how to do it without doing some mistakes.

At localbitcoins, you also have to give your bank details to the buyer for payment. So it does not remain anonymous at all. But that is not bitcoin's fault. It is the users fault to use it as an exchange commodity instead of a currency.\nNot necessarily. With localbitcoins, I can buy using cash-in-mail. There doesn't need to be a return address either so that is completely anonymous. I can also buy using gift cards and reload cards with cash to exchange for BTC so my name and id is never associated.\nYes but preferable choice tends to go towards online banking.

Also an 8MB cap doesn't mean that each block has to be a full 8MB. If we get to 16MB blocks before LN is in full deployment and then LN becomes fully deployed the cap can still be 16MB, but maybe the actual blocksize will go back down to 1MB/block actually being used.\n", "author": "lyth0s Legendary Offline Activity: 1260 Merit: 1000 World Class Cryptonaire "}], "date": "2015-06-21 23:01:40"}, {"content": "This topic has been moved to\nMicro Earnings\n.\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1095921.0\n", "views": 228, "author": "EFS Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1862 Merit: 1183 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMOVED: Celebrate Our 3 Month Anniversary By Winning 3 Times the Bitcoin - Thank You \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [], "date": "2015-06-21 16:27:07"}]}
