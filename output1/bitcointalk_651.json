WeÂll address the important questions about Bitcoin, such as:\nHow does Bitcoin work? What makes Bitcoin different? How secure are your Bitcoins? How anonymous are Bitcoin users? What determines the price of Bitcoins? Can cryptocurrencies be regulated? What might the future hold?\nAfter this course, youÂll know everything you need to be able to separate fact from fiction when reading claims about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. YouÂll have the conceptual foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network. And youÂll be able to integrate ideas from Bitcoin in your own projects.\nCourse Lecturers:\nArvind Narayanan, Princeton University\nJoseph Bonneau, Princeton University\nEdward Felten, Princeton University\nAndrew Miller, University of Maryland\nCourse Syllabus\nIntro to Crypto and Cryptocurrencies\nCryptographic Hash Functions\nHash Pointers and Data Structures\nDigital Signatures\nPublic Keys as Identities\nSimple Cryptocurrencies\nHow Bitcoin Achieves Decentralization\nCentralization vs. decentralization\nDistributed consensus\nConsensus without identity: the block chain\nIncentives and proof of work\nPutting it all together\nMechanics of Bitcoin\nBitcoin transactions\nBitcoin scripts\nApplications of Bitcoin scripts\nBitcoin blocks\nThe Bitcoin network\nLimitations &amp; improvements\nHow to Store and Use Bitcoins\nSimple Local Storage\nHow to Store and Use Bitcoins\nSecret Keys\nHot and Cold Storage\nSplitting and Sharing Keys\nOnline Wallets and Exchanges\nPayment Services\nTransaction Fees\nCurrency Exchange Markets\nBitcoin mining\nThe task of Bitcoin miners\nMining hardware\nEnergy consumption &amp; ecology\nMining pools\nMining incentives and strategies\nBitcoin and anonymity\nAnonymity basics\nOverview of Bitcoin deanonymization\nMixing\nDecentralized mixing\nZerocoin and Zerocash\nTor and the Silk Road\nCommunity, Politics, and Regulation\nConsensus in Bitcoin\nBitcoin Core Software\nStakeholders : WhoÂs in Charge?\nRoots of Bitcoin\nGovernments Notice Bitcoin\nAnti Money-Laundering Regulation\nNew YorkÂs BitLicense Proposal\nAlternative Mining Puzzles\nEssential Puzzle Requirements\nASIC Resistant Puzzles\nProof-of-useful-work\nNonoutsourceable Puzzles\nProof-of-Stake\nBitcoin as a platform\nBitcoin as an append-only log\nBitcoins as Âsmart propertyÂ\nSecure multi-party lotteries in Bitcoin\nBitcoin as randomness source\nPrediction markets &amp; real-world data feeds\nAltcoins and the Cryptocurrency Ecosystem\nShort History of Altcoins\nInteraction between Bitcoin and altcoins\nLifecycle of an Altcoin\nBitcoin-Backed Altcoins, ÂSide ChainsÂ\nThe future of Bitcoin?\nThe block chain as a vehicle for decentralization\nRoutes to decentralization\nWhat can we decentralize?\nWhen is decentralization a good idea?\nRecommended Background\nAn introductory computer science class (such as CS 101) is required.\nBasic programming experience as well as some knowledge of data structures and algorithms (linked lists, sorting, searching...) are strongly recommended.\nSuggested Readings\nThere is no required reading for this class.

The Internet is based on IP communications.\n2. Your direct peers know your IP.\n3. Your outputs will be recorded in a public ledger.\n4. Your inputs will be recorded in a ledger.\n5. Various transaction in the ledger are associated with identities by third-parties.\nSecond Level Axioms (Networking)\n1. The more hops between you and the reader of the ledger, the less chance there is of associating your inputs/outputs with your IP. (Infinite hops eliminates the association.)\n2. Encryption between hops can help protect from network snooping.\nThird Level Axioms (Transactions)\n1. Increased participants in a transaction reduces individual identity. (Infinite participants in a transaction eliminates identity.)\n2. Increased anonymity between participants in a transaction decreases identity.\n3. Increased cost of transaction (net loss) decreases risk of information gathering only participants.\n4. Increased spending stake decreases risk of information gathering only participants.\n5. Increased profit stake increases risk of information gathering only participants, and can negate #4.\n6. The primary privacy goal is to eliminate the association of the input Bitcoin address from the output address.\nFourth Level Axioms (Randomization Through Pooling)\n1. Increased pools size increase individual identity outside pool.\n2. Increased hops to pool increases identity within pool.\n3. Hashes and public keys can decrease identity within pool.\n4. Increasing pool size can increase transaction latency.\n5. The pool needs a means of output the transactions in a way that minimizes exposure of input identity.\n6. Minimizing viewers of the building of the pool minimizes risk of those outside it identifying participants.\n7. Destruction of the pool after it completes its mission minimizes leakage of its internal history. Absolute destruction may not be obtainable, but this is an avenue that could be explored to at least minimize persistence of its past.\n8. Separating the input from the output increases privacy.\nLooking at this, it appears like a side-chain can be used to build a pool. However, obtaining a desirable size can result in significant latency. Perhaps one inevitable trade-off is increased latency for increased privacy.\nThe trick is to create a pool protocol with the following goals:\n1. Individual nodes, especially non-participants in a pool, have minimal knowledge of each pool while still facilitating its building.\n2. Building of the pool is completely decentralized.\n2. Have algorithms that match participants to create a complete pool.\n3. Have the ability to prove to Bitcoin that the final transaction is authentic.\n4. Allows the creator(s) of the final transaction to do so without being participants in it.\nExample Use Case\nJoe wants to send 1 BTC to Sally. He specifies that the pool size must include no less than 100 participants, and each participant must have a stake of no less than 0.1 BTC.\nJoe authorizes the side-chain to withdraw 1 BTC from Bitcoin while securing the output within the side-chain. Only the node who can execute the final pooled transaction with BTC can know the recipient, and that node will by then have no way of knowing it was from Joe. The only known by intermediary nodes is the amount of the transaction. The encrypted output is \"authenticated\" but unknown.\nThis permits the authenticated output to become part of the temporary ledge as a candidate for a pool. When enough candidates build, and perhaps other \"proof of work\" criteria was met, the pool transaction outputs could be sent to Bitcoin. At this point, no details of the pool are persisted within the side-chain.\nChallenges\n1. Cryptography must hide the destination address from all but the last node.\n2. The side-chain must be trust-less, yet be able to act on behalf of Joe with his permission, particularly with regard to withdrawing his BTC.\n3. The side-chain must be able to protect Alice's BTC after that point.\n4. The final node transferring Alice's BTC must be able to do so, yet without the ability to steal it.\n5. The final node should not require any knowledge of how the pool was built. It just knows the requirements were completed.\n6. There needs to be a way to ensure that this does not result in duplicate Bitcion transactions. How will the input and output transactions be created on Bitcoin?\nThis last challenge appears to require that side-chains become a feature of Bitcoins. This could eliminate the concept of a final node completely, as this side-chain could reach consensus and simply \"broadcast\" the final transaction to Bitcoin. That way, 100 nodes could do this, and it wouldn't matter.\nIntegrating with Bitcoin\nWhether this pooling became a part of the Bitcoin is irrelevant because no matter what, the building of a pool requires a side-chain. It makes sense to just put general side-chain capability in Bitcoin, and just consider this a use-case.\nBitcoin can define this as a collateral side-chain, \"locking\" withdrawals until outputs are made, maintaining a side-chain balance. This would mean that Joe's 1 BTC would be locked, perhaps with an expiration. Alternately, a side-chain could \"deposit\" with Bitcoin collateral equal to the maximum withdrawal balance. A hybrid of these two could be possible as well. Regardless, to build a pool totalling 100 BTC these funds would have to either be provided as collateral to Bitcoin first, or temporarily \"lock\" withdrawals (tx inputs) until the pool dispersed its funds back to Bitcoin (tx outputs). Ideally, many pools would build simultaneously to separate withdrawals from deposits, though. So, we could realistically be talking about 1000 BTC to support 10x100 BTC pools building at once. If it could only build one at a time, then inputs could be associated with output pool.\nSide chains can charge TX fees, which can then be used to recoup any collateral, or free up any locked funds. Competition between side chains would keep these fees low.\nIn any event, I don't see this type of side-chain happening without a well designed fork of Bitcoin to enable it. I also, given the axioms, don't see this type of privacy being possible without a hard fork.\nIronically, I didn't imagine this requiring side chains when I started writing this. This is the first time I really thought it out, as well. Now that I have, I think I really love them. Despite the accusations of them favoring Bitstream, if designed right, they will be equally beneficial to EVERYONE. In this scheme, it is entirely decentralized and trust-less. Anyone can fire up a side-chain and potentially profit from it. Anyone can use any side chain open to the public, such as the privacy one I just described. Public ones will compete, creating an open marketplace. And, as I described, the side-chain itself can choose to be completely decentralized and trust-less. Nodes will have to run it, and will require an incentive, possibly earning transaction fees. But, that's no different than Bitcoin today.\n", "author": "erik777 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 504 Merit: 250 Earn with impressio.io "}], "date": "2015-09-03 04:53:05"}], "posts": [{"content": "Hello everyone, I've been away from this forum for almost half a year now and I didn't pay attention to BTC for that time too.

WeÂll address the important questions about Bitcoin, such as:\nHow does Bitcoin work? What makes Bitcoin different? How secure are your Bitcoins? How anonymous are Bitcoin users? What determines the price of Bitcoins? Can cryptocurrencies be regulated? What might the future hold?\nAfter this course, youÂll know everything you need to be able to separate fact from fiction when reading claims about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. YouÂll have the conceptual foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network.

The Internet is based on IP communications.\n2. Your direct peers know your IP.\n3. Your outputs will be recorded in a public ledger.\n4. Your inputs will be recorded in a ledger.\n5. Various transaction in the ledger are associated with identities by third-parties.\nSecond Level Axioms (Networking)\n1. The more hops between you and the reader of the ledger, the less chance there is of associating your inputs/outputs with your IP. (Infinite hops eliminates the association.)\n2. Encryption between hops can help protect from network snooping.\nThird Level Axioms (Transactions)\n1. Increased participants in a transaction reduces individual identity. (Infinite participants in a transaction eliminates identity.)\n2. Increased anonymity between participants in a transaction decreases identity.\n3. Increased cost of transaction (net loss) decreases risk of information gathering only participants.\n4. Increased spending stake decreases risk of information gathering only participants.\n5. Increased profit stake increases risk of information gathering only participants, and can negate #4.\n6. The primary privacy goal is to eliminate the association of the input Bitcoin address from the output address.\nFourth Level Axioms (Randomization Through Pooling)\n1. Increased pools size increase individual identity outside pool.\n2. Increased hops to pool increases identity within pool.\n3. Hashes and public keys can decrease identity within pool.\n4. Increasing pool size can increase transaction latency.\n5. The pool needs a means of output the transactions in a way that minimizes exposure of input identity.\n6. Minimizing viewers of the building of the pool minimizes risk of those outside it identifying participants.\n7. Destruction of the pool after it completes its mission minimizes leakage of its internal history. Absolute destruction may not be obtainable, but this is an avenue that could be explored to at least minimize persistence of its past.\n8. Separating the input from the output increases privacy.\nLooking at this, it appears like a side-chain can be used to build a pool. However, obtaining a desirable size can result in significant latency. Perhaps one inevitable trade-off is increased latency for increased privacy.\nThe trick is to create a pool protocol with the following goals:\n1. Individual nodes, especially non-participants in a pool, have minimal knowledge of each pool while still facilitating its building.\n2. Building of the pool is completely decentralized.\n2. Have algorithms that match participants to create a complete pool.\n3. Have the ability to prove to Bitcoin that the final transaction is authentic.\n4. Allows the creator(s) of the final transaction to do so without being participants in it.\nExample Use Case\nJoe wants to send 1 BTC to Sally. He specifies that the pool size must include no less than 100 participants, and each participant must have a stake of no less than 0.1 BTC.\nJoe authorizes the side-chain to withdraw 1 BTC from Bitcoin while securing the output within the side-chain. Only the node who can execute the final pooled transaction with BTC can know the recipient, and that node will by then have no way of knowing it was from Joe. The only known by intermediary nodes is the amount of the transaction. The encrypted output is \"authenticated\" but unknown.\nThis permits the authenticated output to become part of the temporary ledge as a candidate for a pool. When enough candidates build, and perhaps other \"proof of work\" criteria was met, the pool transaction outputs could be sent to Bitcoin. At this point, no details of the pool are persisted within the side-chain.\nChallenges\n1. Cryptography must hide the destination address from all but the last node.\n2. The side-chain must be trust-less, yet be able to act on behalf of Joe with his permission, particularly with regard to withdrawing his BTC.\n3. The side-chain must be able to protect Alice's BTC after that point.\n4. The final node transferring Alice's BTC must be able to do so, yet without the ability to steal it.\n5. The final node should not require any knowledge of how the pool was built. It just knows the requirements were completed.\n6. There needs to be a way to ensure that this does not result in duplicate Bitcion transactions. How will the input and output transactions be created on Bitcoin?\nThis last challenge appears to require that side-chains become a feature of Bitcoins. This could eliminate the concept of a final node completely, as this side-chain could reach consensus and simply \"broadcast\" the final transaction to Bitcoin. That way, 100 nodes could do this, and it wouldn't matter.\nIntegrating with Bitcoin\nWhether this pooling became a part of the Bitcoin is irrelevant because no matter what, the building of a pool requires a side-chain. It makes sense to just put general side-chain capability in Bitcoin, and just consider this a use-case.\nBitcoin can define this as a collateral side-chain, \"locking\" withdrawals until outputs are made, maintaining a side-chain balance. This would mean that Joe's 1 BTC would be locked, perhaps with an expiration. Alternately, a side-chain could \"deposit\" with Bitcoin collateral equal to the maximum withdrawal balance. A hybrid of these two could be possible as well. Regardless, to build a pool totalling 100 BTC these funds would have to either be provided as collateral to Bitcoin first, or temporarily \"lock\" withdrawals (tx inputs) until the pool dispersed its funds back to Bitcoin (tx outputs). Ideally, many pools would build simultaneously to separate withdrawals from deposits, though. So, we could realistically be talking about 1000 BTC to support 10x100 BTC pools building at once. If it could only build one at a time, then inputs could be associated with output pool.\nSide chains can charge TX fees, which can then be used to recoup any collateral, or free up any locked funds. Competition between side chains would keep these fees low.\nIn any event, I don't see this type of side-chain happening without a well designed fork of Bitcoin to enable it. I also, given the axioms, don't see this type of privacy being possible without a hard fork.\nIronically, I didn't imagine this requiring side chains when I started writing this. This is the first time I really thought it out, as well. Now that I have, I think I really love them. Despite the accusations of them favoring Bitstream, if designed right, they will be equally beneficial to EVERYONE. In this scheme, it is entirely decentralized and trust-less. Anyone can fire up a side-chain and potentially profit from it. Anyone can use any side chain open to the public, such as the privacy one I just described. Public ones will compete, creating an open marketplace. And, as I described, the side-chain itself can choose to be completely decentralized and trust-less. Nodes will have to run it, and will require an incentive, possibly earning transaction fees. But, that's no different than Bitcoin today.\n", "author": "erik777 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 504 Merit: 250 Earn with impressio.io "}], "date": "2015-09-03 04:53:05"}]}
