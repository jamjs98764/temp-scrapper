(from memory so dont get pedantic if the date isnt accurate)\nbut for things like payment codes.. this is again raised to 80bytes.. so there is a 40 byte excess.\nso please look at all the new features intended to be added and add up all the extra bytes that would suddenly be needed to perform these new features, compared to normal 2015 transactions(pre segwit)\nEG show a demonstration of a basic one input to one output transaction(2015 pre segwit design).. and then show a transaction demo that represents how much extra data is needed in moving funds to a sidechain. and count the byte difference of the transactions.\ndo the same for payment codes..

Anything that blockstream would try to do with Bitcoin Core would have to go through sipa because he is the only one with commit access that works for blockstream. He can't \"give them the keys\" because there are no keys and there is nothing to give. Sipa could write code and commit it or people at blockstream could write code and submit a PR. Either way, the other 6 people with commit access would notice or the other hundreds of people actively watching Bitcoin Core's progress (me included) would notice. They would definitely notice if code was committed without a PR because that goes against the code review process. They would definitely notice if a PR was merged without discussion or with discussion and a lot of NACKs. That would of course result in the offending code being reverted and sipa having his commit access revoked. If that doesn't happen, a lot of people will be forking Bitcoin away from Bitcoin Core.\nSo going along with your analogy, sure the person in the family can give his friends the keys, but he cannot disable the alarm system.

It's something that Bitcoin Core strongly believe it does not have the moral or technical authority to do, and attempting to do so would be a failure to uphold the principles of the system. It's not something to do lightly, and people who think that it's okay to change the system's rules out from under users who own coins in it are not people that I'd want to be taking advice from-- that kind of thinking is counter to the entire Bitcoin value proposition.\nThe other things you're talking about are fully compatible updates which users can voluntarily choose to participate in or can choose to ignore. Users opt into applying them to their own transactions, and they shouldn't really be anyone elses business.  Neither of them are forces applied to third parties.\nIn the case of Opt-In RBF-- that is purely local node policy, not even a consensus rule. If even one miner wants to use it it could not be prevented even if all the other users and developers and all miners agreed that it was desirable to prevent. Worse, there are already miners out there doing full replacement without the signaling. Without the positive uses being able to opt in and voluntarily choose to use replacement, we will likely see more of that spread sooner. So you have something that causes no harm, potentially delays harm, and is fully optional being used to attack Bitcoin Core? I think that is really lame. Especially since replacement of non-final transactions was a feature in the _very first_ version of Bitcoin that was only turned off much later because as it was originally implemented it was a flooding vulnerability. In people's zest to politically manipulate others into disliking Bitcoin Core it seems that some have really lost the plot.\nIn fact, 51% is explicitly defined as consensus.\nWe all wait with abated breath while you go and cite that \"explicit\" definition for us.\nIt's nonsense in any case: When you're talking about the hard rules of the system-- the limits that make it valuable and tractable-- no amount of hashpower is enough to override it. Not 99.9%.  If a miner violates the hard rules of the system they are simply not miners anymore as far as all the nodes are concerned. This is an integral part of the checks and balances that create and preserve the incentives of the system: Miners can't just steal a bit on the side, their power is very strongly shifted to either participate honestly or DOS attack the whole thing (in which case the users would presumably change the proof of work), but not attack the system while continuing to have it usable.\nBut really, if any of you have an honest desire to continue a conversation-- go convince the OP to retract the wonky and non-factual claim.

(hoping for a payday if they kiss enough ass)\nthe thing i do find funny is that segwit archival mode (fullnode) data transmission is the same as a 2mb limit proposal. i find it funny that blockstream thinks that libsecp256k1 wont be included in other implementations to fix processing time.\nthen i find it funny that the blockstream crew want to force people off of bitcoin blockchain and get users onto valueless altcoins and security risk offchains. rather than doing what the real community want, which is to expand bitcoin (not blockchains).\ni have nothing against sidechains, but the methods blockstream are doing it, are obvious to push people off of bitcoin. rather than making it a free choice to jump back and forth. this is done by no longer fixing the tx fee to a sub 2cent value that moves down in decimals if the fiat price increases, to keep transactions cheap. thus attempting to make bitcoin less useful for normal people.\nthe blind suggestion that segwit helps more people become fullnodes, is fundamentally flawed. most users will not enable archival mode and so when the 5000 peers connect together, not all of them will stick with being archival mode. as they are told \"everything is fine compatible mode still works\", users lose no function.. but there would be a lack of peers set as archival node to be able to get the full data to validate. (one of many bait and switch plans)\nalong with pushing part of the community onto sidechains, more users wont be using bitcoin fullnodes but instead running elements fullnode.\nblockstream looks good on glossy paper. but in the reality of real life usage scenario's, all of those dreams evaporate and what is left is a incorporated bitcoin that normal people cant use because it has been outpriced with tx fee's and bloated with \"paymentcodes\" and other stuff.\nif only blockstream thought logically that tx fee's are not even required as a income stream for atleast 2 decades, they would not be pushing for tx fee rise... oh wait they would, as they need the rise to push people away from bitcoin.\nblockstream really do need to look at the genesis block message and remember what bitcoin was all about. as i feel that blockstream payday's have blinded people away from an open currency and swayed people over to the bad code and corporate strategy to create profit at the expense of controlling normal peoples finances.\nby saying i want 2mb does not mean im in the r3 boat. i hate them for the same reasons as the blockstream corp. all i want is clean code that remains where bitcoin is the open currency for anyone to be part of.\na 2mb implementation with libsecp256k1 does not cause doomsday scenarios of needing datacenters to run fullnodes... its just that simple\nif blockstream shills reply about the malle-fix. that too can be done in a dozen different ways too. without all of the hidden corporate agenda that would push normal people (the million+ population) away from hoarding bitcoins.\neveryone knows that in april if they want to remain as full-node status, they are going to need to upgrade, so its not as soft as the glossy leaflet pretends. if you dont upgrade you wont be fully validating node. and if they do upgrade, some will choose not to run full archival mode, so blockstream will be cutting the full node population down. while not (longterm) increasing capacity because of the other features that add more bytes to a tx (after segwits promise of less bytes).\ni see soo many bait and switch plans that end up pushing normal people down a one way street that moves away from hoarding bitcoins... and that is the thing that i do not find funny\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Offline Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2016-02-04 12:17:05", "content": "Judging by the lack of coins showing up on the\nbitcoinocracy polls\n, the vigorously attacking groups may not be big investors in Bitcoin.\nWill Blockstream Core agree to shift to 2mb if bitcoinocracy poll indicates more coins are supporting 2mb ?\n", "author": "Jimmy Wales Member Offline Activity: 94 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2016-02-04 12:22:16", "content": "I feel really bad for you dedicated bastards who actually put your time and talents into developing a potentially revolutionary technology, only to get shit on constantly by the ridiculous mood that's been overtaking the Bitcoin community lately.

Let's start:\n1) Segwit has nothing to do with sidechains or LN as a concept (even though it carries necessary changes for LN).\n2) Any altcoin could be a sidechain to Bitcoin with two-way peg and this has a wast amount of use cases; sidechain != LN\n3) LN, being a second layer solution that enables two participants a theoretically infinite amount of transaction, is now a bad thing?\n4) This has nothing to do with Mastercoin.\nIf the XT with 8MB increase can be called an alt-coin, then this segwit/sidechain are all 100% genuine alt-coins. And such a large change without any formal design specification (Just read BIP 14X, those are all terrible documentations without any useful information, just redefine everything. In fact I doubt if anyone have read them, if you happened read them, just tell me where is the witness block structure architecture?\n)\nSomeone mentioned: Respect to Satoshi writings is essential, not because he is a god or something but because that's what we were all offered and put our money and effort for believing in it. We did not put our money and mining rigs to construct infrastructure for running segwit/sidechain\nLN is another story, I heard that miners don't like it, since it reduce their fee income\n", "author": "johnyj Legendary Offline Activity: 1848 Merit: 1000 Beyond Imagination "}, {"date": "2016-02-04 16:40:11", "content": "If the XT with 8MB increase can be called an alt-coin, then this segwit/sidechain/LN are all 100% genuine alt-coins.

Would you call Clams an altcoin or would you call it Bitcoin? Because Clams did not start off like most of the alt-coins (forked off of Bitcoin but with a \"clean sheet\"). They've forked off with the existing balances at one point in time. The only difference between Clams and Bitcoin (from this viewpoint) is that it is not called Bitcoin Clams.\nAgain, do you even know how an altcoin gets created? Segwit has nothing to do with an altcoin; a sidechain could be technically called an altcoin pegged to Bitcoin; LN has nothing to do with an altcoin either (does it have its own blockchain? No.). There is no need to continue this discussion as you obviously don't properly understand the basic concepts of a cryptocurrency.\nSomeone mentioned: Respect to Satoshi writings is essential, not because he is a god or something but because that's what we were all offered and put our money and effort for believing in it.

People can make multiple fake accounts and thus submit fake votes making one option more popular than it really is. Bitcoinocracy combats that by requiring that people sign messages with addresses so it really is based on how many coins. But that gives unequal weighting to the votes, although I suppose that is a better representation of the economic majority.\nThe questions asked in those polls are not without bias. The way that the questions are phrased typically imply one meaning or the other, kind of making people want to vote one way or the other. The questions should instead be neutral and bias free to get the most unbiased responses. Also, the questions should provide information for people to read about what those changes are actually for and how they will work so that people actually know what they are voting for. The information should of course be unbiased, but that information is not available in the polls.\nIn any scientific study, just having one of the above biases would invalidate the entire study. Therefore, since any online voting platform has those biases in them, the entire voting thing and checking those sites for the supposed consensus is invalid and thus should not be considered or referenced when discussing consensus among the population.\n", "author": "achow101 Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 1526 Merit: 1600 3F1Y9yquzvY6RWvKbw2n2zeo9V5mvBhADU "}, {"date": "2016-02-05 22:35:40", "content": "Judging by the lack of coins showing up on the\nbitcoinocracy polls\n, the vigorously attacking groups may not be big investors in Bitcoin.\nYour incessant use of this canard only weakens your arguments. bitcoinocracy is no more credible than consider.it.\nBitcoinocracy is immune to Sybil attack, because you must prove ownership of BTC to participate.\nConsider.it is so open to Sybil attack it might as well be a honeypot.\nThe former is signal, the latter is noise.\nNo. All the above is noise.

Full nodes can veto the miners at any given moment. All of the miners investments can instantly become expensive useless liabilities if the economic consensus of full nodes rejects the miners longest chain.\nI will give you two possible scenario's of how this can occur-\n1) In the unlikely event Classic convinces 75% of miners to HF, their are multiple extremely large investors* who have made commitments to dump their classic coins and keep their original coins.(remember a HF essentially doubles the money supply unless there is complete consensus). This high stakes form of attack would quickly devalue the chain with the most hashpower driving miners to the other chain or completely ruining both chains. Others may discount this due to the flawed assumption that this would only temporarily devalue the currency but in reality this attack can be ongoing and be conducted in a manner to create steady and persistent downward pressure on the majority hashpower chain.\n2) Their are multiple technical solutions that can be implemented if a miner mis behaves where their double rounds of SHA256 hashing means less or nothing at all by the nodes.  Full nodes simply can change the consensus algo.\n* These threats aren't being made by Core or blockstream but other large investors some of which are quite \"unstable\"\nFinally, if nodes are essential to Bitcoin security &amp; are quite cheap to implement, what's preventing a malefactor from breaking Bitcoin by throwing up a bunch of misbehaving nodes (which \"simply ignore blocks which do not conform to the [new] rules of the protocol (and ban the [old rule] peer(s) that sent them).\"?\nThis was also just answered with a specific example.

There was another incident in 2013 which made it to about 35 blocks.  More recently, at the enforcement of strict-der, nodes started enforcing the new soft-fork rule with 95% hashpower support, and miners not in conformance with the rule (then a hardfork) managed to produce a chain of blocks 5 longer.\nBy block count, litecoin's chain has more 'work' than Bitcoin, and yet bitcoin nodes don't follow it.\nI think that many people, versed in pre-cypherpunk organizational modalities constantly seek to attribute control to some authority in any system.

If you build out capacity with no way to reverse the changes and they don't come then we get even lower fees and possibly a collapse of our mining community leading to network security vulnerabilities.\nI agree deflationary fee's are the way to go but we would need a collaborative protocol for adjusting fees based on bitcoins market cap but how would that work?\nPart of the question about max block size is how do we decide on whats a fair fee for transactions based on the needs of the network at any given time to insure security. I don't have the answer to this.\nUltimately your speculating on two things we can not control, our user base and Bitcoins market cap. This is hubris, it's risky without the ability to automatically reduce the max block size on demand to maintain a minimal level of fees to ensure (what still needs to be determined) a minimum level of security based on Bitcoins market cap. The deeper question is 'How thick do the walls of a safe need to be to protect its contents when the value of its contents is always changing?'\nI believe we should go for a much bumpier and longer path but ultimately more safe. We should wait until the very last minute to up the block size and each time increase it in miniscule amounts (5% max) only when fees become so high that they start to impede adoption would you see the real consensus we need.\nYes in the short term we lose the ability to handle micro transactions but this would only be temporary, a few years at most if we continue to grow at the same rate and yes some people may jump ship to alt coins with lower fees but they would be doing so at the cost of security, stability and network effect (acceptance.)\n", "author": "Quantus Legendary Offline Activity: 883 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2016-02-09 11:34:41", "content": "If bitcoin fees reached $1 to get the transaction confirmed, this will prevent people from using it for micro transactions and they will start looking for an alternative coin with less fees like Dogecoin for instance. maybe after block reward reaches 0 miners will increase the fees until UW become cheaper than BTC to transfer money\nThere is competition in the market.

Because segwit adds nearly the capacity of a 2MB hard fork. And a hard fork to 1.5MB would add 0.5MB capacity to that (plus whatever additional segwit might provide under a 1.5MB regime vs. 1MB regime given expected growth in multi-sig transactions).\nYou were complaining in another thread that segwit alone wouldn't add enough capacity to justify confidential transactions. Now, with an additional 0.5MB per block suggested, you are again complaining about insufficient capacity to justify confidential transactions. Can you back up your complaints with some math to justify your incessant complaints?\nAm I wrong to suggest that your complaints about confidential transactions also apply to multi-sig transactions? Would you then go on to argue that Core devs optimizing bitcoin for multi-sig transactions via segwit is also some form of trickery -- to trick users into believing they are getting more capacity than they really are?\nYour whole approach is fear-mongering with no factual basis.\npeople want capacity increases more then features.\nDo they? What proof do you have? I don't. I'm more concerned about adding privacy features to preserve fungibility than I am about capacity.

You are judging Classic's proposal based on 2MB with no conditions... You are then judging Core's proposal based on 1MB vs. all optimizations that would be built into the code anyway. That is called \"comparing apples with oranges.\"\nOr are you suggesting that no layers should ever be built on top of the blockchain? That, of course, is not up to you.\nAgain, this is no different than you complaining about the size of multi-sig transactions. Your comparison is basically saying \"Core uses multi-sig transactions, which take up more space. So any capacity increase is bullshit. Classic doesn't use multi-sig transactions and never will -- and no other features or layers can ever be built onto Bitcoin. So you can't count any of that stuff against Classic's 2MB limit.\"\nYou can complain about Confidential Transactions and Lightning all you want. People are going to use them because they are useful. That is not your choice to make. You can choose to accept that multi-sig transactions (along with future features of the protocol) exist and that people will use them (thereby adding \"little bytes here and there) ....or you can deny it. But if you choose the latter, don't expect people to take your fuzzy math seriously.\nIn the end, you never even showed the math for 2MB blocks. Your math errs on the conservative side for signature size, and does not account for growth in the use of multi-signature transactions. I.e. a 1.6MB block of standard transactions = a 2MB block of 2-of-2 multi-sig transactions. Do you expect use of multi-sig to decrease?\nIgnoring your conservative numbers for signature size and your lack of accounting for growth in the use of multi-signature transactions, your numbers imply less than 10% difference between 2MB vs. 1.5MB+segwit. I think a more thorough analysis would reveal that this is being overly generous to Classic. I find it sufficient for now that for such a small difference, Matt Corallo's suggestion of 1.5MB is still a \"slap in the face.\" I think it's clear who is being reasonable here, and who isn't.\nbut wait.. why 1.5,,, why not 2mb.. seeing as there is going to be a block limit increase and all this change. lets make it 2mb.. and then we can have 5000 tx, with all the extra data that blockstream added aswell..\nYou're not giving any reasoning. If 1.5MB, why not 2MB? That's your logic. Fine, if 1.5MB, why not 8MB? Why not 32MB? Why not 4GB? Why not 8GB? Why not 32GB? Cuz Franky says, \"We can haz more tx!!!11!!!11!\"\nmore then enough buffer space to grow and have some room for peace of mind. just like in 2013 when people were not worried about the 1mb limit because miners were making 1200 tx(half a meg) and had plenty of room to not even think back then that the block limit would cause months and months of debate.\nDebate is good. Pushing a contentious rules activation at 75% miner agreement, and then rolling out a hard fork after less than a month will likely break bitcoin's ledger forever. On that note, I noticed you stopped responding to our argument about why Group C would never have its blocks orphaned, and why multiple blockchains would result. That isn't \"peace of mind.\"\na 1.5mb is just a gesture of crappy non reasoning increase that does not really provide enough buffer room for miners to expand in their own time.. with a 1.5mb increase we will just be debating the block limit again within 12 months.. so lets increase it to 2mb so that it gives developers a couple years(hopefully) of headbreathing room to have calm and peaceful time to work on more things. instead of forever chasing their own tail endlessly every year.\n\"Does not really provide enough buffer room for miners to expand in their own time?\" What the hell does that even mean?\nAgain, debate is good. And a minimal block size increase that can be more realistically simulated (i.e. a testable regime) then rolled out in a far less controversial hard fork initiated by a much more established and experienced dev team via an update -- like any update before it -- sounds great. That sounds better than a small minority of inexperienced devs pushing a hard fork as a takeover, without miner consensus and with minimal notice for nodes to update.\ni personally think that people can handle more then a 2mb+segwit limit. without being a data center..\nbut the majority of people think that 2mb is a good enough MINIMAL number that gives enough breathing room without the arguments of doomsday datacenter theory.\nbut 1.5mb.. thats just a slap in the face small increase that is not helpful to ease the issues. and is just proposed mainly to keep the debate running nonstop.\nRemember, your argument is that \"Core=Blockstream.\" You compare 2MB vs. 1.5MB+segwit. (We know that Classic is 100% dependent on Core to implement segwit compatibility in Classic, so there is no basis for talk of 2MB+segwit to begin with -- it's not clear whether Core devs are willing to do the work for Classic or not)\nPlease provide evidence that 2MB blocks put no pressure on bandwidth requirements of nodes. If not, suggest what degree of negative effects on node health is acceptable under your proposition. Or do you believe that node health is not an issue at all?\nIt's funny to me that 1.5MB is a slap in the face, yet 2MB (as long as Gavin pushes it) is acceptable.\n", "author": "madjules007 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 401 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2016-02-09 08:15:47", "content": "It's funny to me that 1.5MB is a slap in the face, yet 2MB (as long as Gavin pushes it) is acceptable.\nIt's funnier than that: Matt's \"1.5MB\" would have 31% more capacity than the \"Classic\" 2MB.\n", "author": "gmaxwell Staff Legendary Offline Activity: 2492 Merit: 1445 "}, {"date": "2016-02-09 08:38:53", "content": "what's the point to have 3mb in total, after segwit? 1 mb = almost two with segwit with 1.5, would be almost 3mb\nthose small increase are not that good imho, it's better to go straight to a number of mega that can welcome the future adoption, greatly\ni think many have forget that the adoption it's not going to increase linearly, so having 1 mor emega will not cut it at all\n", "author": "Amph Legendary Offline Activity: 1988 Merit: 1001 "}, {"date": "2016-02-09 09:01:13", "content": "If we are going to fight like this, every time scalability is needed, we will be setting ourselves up for failure.

BItcoin seems to be heading towards \"large transactions only\"?\nLess hash power will solve it. It's not a huge problem to think about. What more important is the size of the user base for the future of BTC.\nLess hash power will make the system more vulnerable to attack, especially when there are many retired old generation mining rigs which can be bought cheaply to assemble an attack\nI think it will be best that the hash rate continuously climb without stop, similar to bitcoin's supply continuously shrink without stop, thus the security of the network is forever increasing. However, that will depend on two variables: Exchange rate and Miner's fee income\nSuppose that exchange rate doubles every 4 years, then the income of miners will remain the same after reward halving. Notice that reward halving is a cut-off event while exchange rate won't jump 100% over night, so basically when the reward halving happens, hash rate is always following the exchange rate, and some kind of shock would still be observed: Halving will reduce the hash rate for a while similar to a difficulty jump of 100%, until new generation chips are manufactured\nHowever, if exchange rate do not change a lot during a 4+ years' period, then the miner's income will really become less, but due to the same reason as above, the hash rate will always self-adjust to the most stable status where majority of the miners can make a small profit\nBut diminishing mining COIN income is a bad thing. The success of bitcoin is mostly based on the fact that people can through mining get lots of bitcoins. If you can not get enough coins through mining, then it is like a centrally planned economy where early adopters already sitting tight on majority of the coins and preventing future people to get enough coins, kind of market manipulation similar to central banks holding large amount of gold reserve but never use them\nSo it is better to slowly raise the fee and keep the future mining income per block above 10 bitcoin at least, so that miner act as a money redistributor, constantly receive money from existing users against the transaction service to avoid wealth concentration\n", "author": "johnyj Legendary Offline Activity: 1848 Merit: 1000 Beyond Imagination "}, {"date": "2016-01-19 18:40:49", "content": "nothing... my other post was wrong, from the look of the blockchain stats it seems that there are 32 btc in fee each day which is somehow 1/100 of the total bitcoin mined today\nthis simply means that the value in future must increase 100x, or the fee increased to 100x(0.01+) or the number of total transactions per day raised to 100x which means 20M per day\nbut the last point is hindered by the block limit, and even 8MB will not suffice\nIf the difficulty keeps on rising, even the 100x price rise is not enough.

When block reward = 0 BTC, at that time also miners will be earning equivalent worth of bitcoins due to high bitcoin value ( like one satoshi = $10 ) and immense number of transactions.\ni made a mistake it's 1/80 and not 1/8, so value need to skyrocket to 80x, a different story indeed...\nbecause it mean that we need a $32K in value in the future, around 2028 already, fee must account for a greater portion of the profit, because the reward would be only 1 btc\n$32k bitcoin in 2028 is achieveable.

They catch is that the buyer and the seller need to be willing to use bitcoin for the transaction.\nPerhaps the seller ships the product up front to establish the relationship, all accounts get active management to breed strong relationships. And connect in the best way possible coffee beans from the country of origin to the the larger consumer worlds.\nCoffee is a unique product, as it is largely consumed and prepped far outside the region it was grown in. It is the most common beverage in the world. 2nd being Tea 3rd being beer. And America is in the midst of a coffee roasting and 'light roast' boom. The retail side of the gourmet artisan stuff things is becoming a very big and highly profitable area of the economy.\nThe thorny issue arises by trying to create a true peer 2 peer marketplace when there is a large knowledge gap on both sides of the border. One country I was looking at on a map for gigglez, is Costa Rica.\nI would have to act as a middle man, and perhaps even escrows would need to get involved, at least initially, with goal of transitioning over the next decade or so to a true p2p marketplace, in which my service wouldn't be needed at all. Places like openbazaar are not going to work, at least not any time soon with newness of it and bitcoin. I am not bashing open bazaar, but rather mentioning it would be very difficult to get behind a platform like that.\nIn the short term this could create a niche for me to profit from, while also getting top dollar for the farmer, and the best price for the buyer.

The key here is we are crossing borders with a completely legal, lightly regulated industry.\nMy initial thoughts to make it secure is to, have someone on this end act as retailer/wholesaler who receives the product but also sells directly to customers either shipping or walk in.\nThe basics I have seen regarding green bean is that your looking for maybe 10-50cents/lb profit. In bitcoin this is okay, once things get going, you can absolutely lower your prices, beat the market, and have as reggie middleton calls it, margin compression,  where if 2016 is projected to earn 10% profits on 1 million in revenue. 2017 will see 7% profits on 10million\n2018 will see 4% on 100million\n2020 will see 1% on 1 billion\n2025 will see .1% on 100billion.  &lt;--- at this point everything is automated. Keep that in mind also. no one owns it. It becomes an autonomous corporation. Farmer is connect directly to the end consumers economy/demands\nHow, go there and learn the farm side of things first hand. Learn the local culture, some language, make some friends. They know your not bullshitting as things have already improved a lot on the income side of things for in recent years, however I think there is still a way to go for them and the consumer.\nBut then to basically make the farmers your friends, while basically doing the same here, working to get to know all the coffee bean roasters, but you gotta get them buy using bitcoins and to ad the platform for their customers to buy the final product with their own bitcoins.\nIf you can sell 25,000 lbs of  green coffee beans in the next 12 months at cost. 2000 lbs of coffee a month, or 500 lbs/week which basically means you need to find 10 people to buy at least 50 lbs of green coffee beans a week\nSo if you can find 10 coffee roasting businesses to buy 50 lbs/week, every week in bitcoin that is your start.. Once you accomplish that, it is your goal to hire a 3rd person, and each of your goals is to find new customers each week with the goal of 1 new customer each week who buys at least  50 lbs of coffee($200/week) After one year you will have a highly profitable company that will grow itself.\nDon't worry about the money or this or that.

For example farmers used to get something like .01 penny/pound Then it rose as Folgers grew up, then starbucks, and then we have today where there is a large fair trade market, which can still be improved even more, cutting out even more people. Soon the farmer is going to receive an order directly from the roaster. and the roaster can be almost anywhere in the world.\nThe innovation is when you make a cup of coffee, the technology advances perhaps to a point in 10 years where coffee is automatically deducted from our wallet which goes to the coffee roaster, who can now place an order for more beans..\nThe goal is to cut out the middlemen, perhaps, roasting beans will become a do it yourself thing\nWe don't need behemoth corporations, especially in a debt based system.

They discover chatter about a weakness in security at a Bitcoin company holding customer funds. That information is turned over to the CIA for research. The CIA then determines if exploitation is possible, develops a plan and then presents the information to the NSA for final execution.\nBefore you laugh and discount the idea, remember the CIA has overthrown governments and placed puppet regimes in power. This would be like child's play for them and definitely not the most heinous thing they've ever done.\nI would think an attacker would have better chances of successfully stealing bitcoin if they were to test for security vulnerabilities themselves? Exchanges likely keep communication about their security procedures (which would potentially contain their weaknesses) to a minimum and the NSA may not be even able to access them\nPrism breaks the law to spy on people. Bitstamp is either incompetent or an entity with amazing abilities stole from them. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.\nI don't think we really know the details of the exploit that was used so I really don't think that conclusion can be made yet. It would be possible that it was an inside job which are particularly difficult to defend against. It is also possible the hack was not even real and they made it up to show how \"resistant\" they would be to a hack/theft\nThat's probably the case. Does anyone still believe MtGox was hacked? It's more likely that they were all inside jobs.\nI personally think gox was more of incompetence then bitstamp. The \"hack\" that brought down gox was not the first time it got hacked (I don't think it was even the 5th time it got hacked). I would say that the coins were probably stolen when bitcoin was trading well under a dollar so the amount was a small amount at the time and they just never bothered to reconcile the amount of bitcoin they should have had and the amount they actually had\nmtgox didn't even go public about the specifics of the hack right away and their cold wallets were compromised which is far more freightening than a hot wallet being compromised.\n", "author": "picolo Hero Member Offline Activity: 882 Merit: 500 https://www.localcoinswap.com/ "}, {"date": "2015-01-14 22:50:02", "content": "Do you think the \"hacker\" will sell the coins in a hurry now when the price crashing?\n", "author": "forevernoob Hero Member Offline Activity: 677 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-01-15 23:55:34", "content": "Do you think the \"hacker\" will sell the coins in a hurry now when the price crashing?\nI don't see why they wouldn't.

The bitcoin you buy must be kept safe o a computer or in paper wallet but bitcoin bought from stock exchange using ANY brokerage is safer because you wont loose the bitcoin its like owning stock.\n1) Your method requires that you trust the company that is supplying you with the account.  If they are hacked, or if they themselves are thieves, then all the bitcoin that they are holding for you could disappear.  This is what happened with MtGOX. Why do you trust them to do a better job of securing the bitcoins than yourself?\n2) In the U.S. there aren't any \"stock exchanges\" that list bitcoins for trade yet.  There also aren't any bitcoin ETFs available for investment yet.  I'm not sure about other countries (I think there is an ETF available in some countries, but not sure if it is open to the public or if it is restricted as to who can participate). This is why you are finding it difficult to find a date.  Bitcoin started just being exchanged for free. It had no value.  People would just send bitcoins to each other for the novelty and entertainment of being able to create transactions and see that they confirmed.  Then two people decided to pretend to use it to buy something.  One sent bitcoins to the other and the one receiving the bitcoins arranged for the bitcoin sender to receive something of value.  It is generally accepted that this transaction occurred on 22nd May 2010 and involved 10,000 bitcoins and 2 pizzas.  This effectively set a \"value\" on bitcoins.  Then more people did similar transactions.  Eventually in chat rooms and websites, people were making and accepting offers to exchange bitcoins for stuff of value (including local currency).  Then innovative people created websites that were specifically for the purpose of bringing together people that has bitcoins and wanted local currency and people that has local currency and wanted bitcoins.  If the website implemented an order book, it was called \"an exchange\".  MtGOX was probably the first \"exchange\" that reached recognizable success. I believe it was launched on 18 July 2010.\n3) Owning bitcoin is not like owning stock.  Stock ownership is a regulated industry that is closely monitored by the government.  It would be very difficult for someone to claim to own your stock and convince the world that the stock belonged to them and not to you.  Bitcoin ownership is controlled only through exclusive access to a set of private keys.  If anyone else gains access to those private keys, they have full control of the associated bitcoins and can do whatever they like with them.  Therefore, unless the broker can prove that they have some sort of insurance policy that covers the loss of bitcoins, there won't be anything they can do to help you if the bitcoins are stolen from them.\n", "author": "DannyHamilton Legendary Offline Activity: 2198 Merit: 1371 "}, {"date": "2015-12-03 14:29:14", "content": "It's definitely safer to buy Bitcoin and properly store it in a cold storage.\nI agree.
