{"post_problems": [{"content": "Bitcoin is ripe for mass adoption in the Philippines, but only after some major hurdles can be addressed. Some of these are:\nMost Filipinos earn about PHP300 or less for a full day's work.\nSmart phones (Android &amp; iPhone) ownership is not that prevalent with Filipinos, however it is slowly growing as their purchase price drops. Now you can get a second-hand one for about 3 to 5 days salary.\nInternet access costs PHP5 (about 10 minutes labour) per 15 minutes.\nFree WiFi is not readily available except in very limited locations in major cities.\nMost Filipinos are un-banked (cash is king) and do not trust/respect banks.\nVery few Filipinos have access to or have a credit/debit card, although those with a bank account do normally have an ATM card linked to their account(s).\nThere are very few businesses in the Philippines that accept bitcoin as payment. Those few that do are mainly in Manila.\nMost Filipinos are familiar with (and many use) pera padala (money remittance) businesses within the Philippines to send money between family and friends in the Philippines. Every major town and almost every small town has at least one pera padala business. These businesses accept cash, charge a fee of about 2% to 3%, and have cash available for the receiver to collect within a few minutes. Most of these remittance amounts are usually well below PHP5000 (about USD100).\nThe Philippines, with a population of over 100 million, is currently served by two major local bitcoin exchange businesses; coins.ph and BuyBitcoin. Both appear to be well operated, economical, and offer normal exchange services as well as some value-added services. When exchanging bitcoin into PHP, both offer bank deposits (free) and pick-up through pera padala businesses (for fee a little above what they are charged  by the para padala business).\nFor the short-term future, I see the main use of bitcoin in the Philippines to be for remittances into and out of the country. Intra-country use will not develop until the Filipino can see an advantage in its use over cash.\n", "views": 9840, "author": "rbscebu Jr. Member Offline Activity: 39 Merit: 0 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin Use In Philippines\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-04-13 08:02:57", "content": "coins.ph and BuyBitcoin.

Also, slow internet connection with such a ludicrous fee (I'm paying $50 for a 3Mbps turtle) is another hurdle when it comes to using bitcoin, given that the network runs through the internet. SMS, on the other hand, is very active within the Filipinos. If only they can make a wallet SMS-ready or transactions can be made through SMS, many Filipinos would consider using bitcoins as well. Also, the main thing that I see people here would use bitcoins is mainly for remittances. I experienced one time when my uncle sent money from Canada to Manila, it took 2 days for the process to complete (which is nuts, because I need the money that same day), whereas in bitcoin, you don't need to wait for that long because transactions are made within a span of minutes from anywhere in the world. That's a +1 for me because I have relatives in other parts of the world that often send money to us.\nExchanges here on the other hand, do little promotion and advertising. Coins.ph do the same promotion in Facebook among others, and tbh, coins.ph is a nice exchange because they really deliver their customers' needs. They also have great customer service that replies instantly and helps you with your problems. Some other exchanges, I'm not familiar with, but I haven't heard a single time in which they do some sh*t over their customers.\n", "author": "dothebeats Legendary Offline Activity: 1582 Merit: 1064 Deleted posts: 91 "}, {"date": "2015-05-02 07:29:47", "content": "Sound like you seem to promote coins.ph and BuyBitcoin, you should show the screen shoot of the exchange so that peoples will trust because the majority of users have not know that exchange,maybe can make it this exchange be in the know.\n", "author": "Kaneki Sr. Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-05-02 09:40:21", "content": "Sound like you seem to promote coins.ph and BuyBitcoin, you should show the screen shoot of the exchange so that peoples will trust because the majority of users have not know that exchange,maybe can make it this exchange be in the know.\nThats right more on newbies haven't exchange.  If they trust and they dont know what is the value of their exchange,coins.ph abd buybitcoin.ph can outweigh the bitcoin users.

Check out the methods offered by the Filipino bitcoin exchanges. I would hazard a guess that 98% of Filipinos live within 30 minutes travel to one of these \"branch locations\".\nAs for \"instant\", it is not quite \"instant\". most Filipino bitcoin exchanges only do their banking/Pera Padala once a day on business days only, so \"instant\" at present can only mean within 8 business hours.\nAs the Filipino bitcoin exchange grows, I hope to see them arranging Pera Padala 7 days a week and multiple times a day. Then you could send bitcoin to the exchange Sunday morning and have the cash available for pick-up within a few hours the same day.\n", "author": "rbscebu Jr. Member Offline Activity: 39 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-06-22 01:31:01", "content": "I see the current Filipino bitcoin exchanges developing in two main directions over the near term; processing overseas remittances, and providing BTC to PHP conversions for Filipino businesses.\nThe current biggest growth potential for the exchanges is in remittances. As this Pera Padala business development grows, I believe that these exchanges need to start shifting their focus on getting Filipino businesses to start accepting bitcoin for payment of goods and services. This is not going to be easy and will take a lot of \"leg work\".\nOnce a Filipino merchant has been convinced to accept bitcoin, he/she then needs internet access at the point-of-sale (POS) and a smartphone/tablet/PC with suitable wallet to accept/tansact the payment. I see it working this way:\n1.  Business gives the customer the price converted to BTC at the current exchange buy rate.\n2.  Customer logs on to WiFi at POS and sends the BTC to the merchant's wallet QR code displayed at the POS.\n3.  The merchant checks the payments confirmation(s) in his wallet and, once suitable confirmation is received, passes over the goods/service paid for to the customer.\n4.  At (say) the end of the day, the merchant uses his bitcoin exchange to convert the BTC takings into PHP and have that deposited into his/her bank account within 8 business hours.\nOne of the problems here is the confirmation time. This is mainly to prevent \"double spending\". It would be up to the merchant to determine what is an acceptable confirmation. For smaller transactions, just being seen by one or two peers may be sufficient confirmation, taking just a few seconds. The larger the transaction, the more confirmations would be needed, taking more time.\nAnother problem is the exchange rate volatility, which can go up as well as down.The bitcoin exchanges offer a few ways to eliminate this volatility.\nThe advantages for the merchant include:\nNo credit/debit card fees/commissions.\nLess work/costs associated with handling cash.\nGood business promotion - at least initially while few merchants accept BTC.\nNow, if only SM would accept BTC!\n", "author": "rbscebu Jr. Member Offline Activity: 39 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-06-22 22:49:00", "content": "well some country is taking the advantage of bitcoin already what is needed to others follow instead block it?\n", "author": "knowhow Hero Member Offline Activity: 560 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-06-23 01:23:12", "content": "well some country is taking the advantage of bitcoin already what is needed to others follow instead block it?\nYes and i think phillipines can adopt bitcoin in 2016 because we have a new president and as filipino citizen we can introduce bitcoin to new president .\n", "author": "Dotakels Sr. Member Offline Activity: 462 Merit: 255 "}, {"date": "2015-06-23 08:15:55", "content": "School tuitions in some universities can be paid by bitcoin now here in Philipines.

Some of these are:\nMost Filipinos earn about PHP300 or less for a full day's work.\nSmart phones (Android &amp; iPhone) ownership is not that prevalent with Filipinos, however it is slowly growing as their purchase price drops. Now you can get a second-hand one for about 3 to 5 days salary.\nInternet access costs PHP5 (about 10 minutes labour) per 15 minutes.\nFree WiFi is not readily available except in very limited locations in major cities.\nMost Filipinos are un-banked (cash is king) and do not trust/respect banks.\nVery few Filipinos have access to or have a credit/debit card, although those with a bank account do normally have an ATM card linked to their account(s).\nThere are very few businesses in the Philippines that accept bitcoin as payment. Those few that do are mainly in Manila.\nMost Filipinos are familiar with (and many use) pera padala (money remittance) businesses within the Philippines to send money between family and friends in the Philippines. Every major town and almost every small town has at least one pera padala business. These businesses accept cash, charge a fee of about 2% to 3%, and have cash available for the receiver to collect within a few minutes. Most of these remittance amounts are usually well below PHP5000 (about USD100).\nThe Philippines, with a population of over 100 million, is currently served by two major local bitcoin exchange businesses; coins.ph and BuyBitcoin. Both appear to be well operated, economical, and offer normal exchange services as well as some value-added services. When exchanging bitcoin into PHP, both offer bank deposits (free) and pick-up through pera padala businesses (for fee a little above what they are charged  by the para padala business).\nFor the short-term future, I see the main use of bitcoin in the Philippines to be for remittances into and out of the country. Intra-country use will not develop until the Filipino can see an advantage in its use over cash.\nRemittance out of the Philippines via Bitcoin is in demand as wiring money out is expensive and subject to all sorts of government interference and investigation, but remittance to the Philippines will be hard to compete with. For example when I had an employee there under a 6mos contract I simply walked into Metrobank here in Canada and paid less than $10 to deliver cash directly to his house same day service. Localbitcoin trading was a problem because of security, there was nowhere he could go and change around $500USD worth of cash in public without getting jacked by criminals watching unless you live around Makati secure areas.\n", "author": "moni3z Hero Member Offline Activity: 886 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-07-12 15:24:11", "content": "slowly i think Filipinos will accept use of\nBTC\nbut not in the province side\nmore likely in huge developed cities\ni even tried to explain it to my friend and i ended up giving up because of the questions being raised\nYes and I think that many of the people are not having bank accounts in philippines so bitcoin would serve their purpose they can easily use it for shopping and stuff and they dont require bank account for that so it can create an revolution in philippines and I believe the government should make it legal.\nIt's legal here in PH .Plus even without bitcoin people here can do shopping without bankaccount.

Now some of the shops are telling me \"No, not yet, but we are looking into it\".\nOne day I will ask and get the response \"Yes sir\".\nAbout 10% of Filipinos are OFW's. Their remittances back to the Philippines total some USD50 billion annually [ref. BSP], with a little under a half of that going through the official banking system. The rest comes through the likes of Western Union.\nThe availability of bitcoin to OFW's is dependent on where they are based and their knowledge of how to obtain bitcoin. I know a few Filipino families with OFW's helping with support. I have contacted their OFW's to suggest that they consider bitcoin for their remittances back to the family. Even with a saving of %5 or more, all said it was just to much trouble.\nAs a side note, I was recently in Bengbu, China on business. Bitcoin is in demand there.

I dont understand why we need their permission to include it in the alphabet.\nCan anybody enlighten me?\nUnicode is the standard that most computers use to define what text characters exist and how to encode them. In the bad days before Unicode (e.g. the 1990s), different computers used different characters and stored them different ways. If I used Russian and you used Japanese, we couldn't exchange files. But with Unicode, everyone's computer handles characters the same way. I can send you Ӂ ڠ ᅗ Æ א ₳ ☢ 五 and your computer can handle it (as long as you have the fonts installed).\nThe point is that computer companies aren't going to patch random characters into their OS. But if you get a character added to Unicode, then everyone will support it. The Unicode Committee has the people who decide what goes into Unicode. The purpose of my proposal is to convince them that putting the Bitcoin symbol into Unicode makes sense and isn't just some crazy idea I came up with.\n(I've oversimplified somewhat but this is probably already more than you want to know about Unicode.)\nKen\n", "author": "kens Newbie Offline Activity: 16 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-09-05 20:25:11", "content": "Reading through the proposal again, it is clear that the Unicode people require a lot of detail.  Canonical Category, Bidi Mirroring.  You seem to know what you're doing.\nI do see one thing that might be slightly improved, although it may not matter.  Where it says, \"(Although\nthere are factions encouraging the use of alternative characters.)\", it might raise the question of whether\nBTC\nis the right symbol to add.  Although you later explain why\nBTC\nis the necessary character, the previous sentence by itself does not make it clear that all alternative characters are insufficient as well as already existing in Unicode, and that the addition of\nBTC\nwould eliminate the need for other characters.\nMaybe something like \"(Although there are small factions who have given up on adding\nBTC\nto Unicode)\" which is still accurate but more favorable.\n", "author": "runpaint Sr. Member Offline Activity: 476 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-09-05 21:12:11", "content": "If Unicode adds\nBTC\n, a small company could sell a keyboard with a\nBTC\nkey and market it to Bitcoin users.  I'd pay .2\nBTC\nfor one.\nYeah that's the best idea for big companies that will produce these keyboard something like this prototype:\n", "author": "jt byte Hero Member Offline Activity: 840 Merit: 500 ARAW "}, {"date": "2015-09-05 21:46:05", "content": "Good work OP.

This afternoon's sudden BIS-induced plunge, taking the virtual currency down $50, has been entirely retraced and more as BTCC (China's leading Bitcoin Exchange) announced it will now accept direct deposits (making it significantly easier for Chinese to rotate their Yuan deposits into the virtual currency and out of the potential clutches of capital controlling communists).\nAs BTCC details,\nRecent bitcoin price increases have reignited enthusiasm in buying bitcoin. BTCC is confident this trend will continue. As such, we are pleased to announce that we now accept direct deposits.\nCustomers now need only log in, click on Account, then Fund, and then select the Bank Deposit option to fund their BTCC accounts through their bank accounts. All customers who have Chinese bank accounts will be able to make direct deposits through ATM transfers or online banking.\nAnd adds, even more crucially...\nBTCC will stop accepting customer deposits through agents on November 15.\nWhich appeared to provide further dip-buying impetus to the recovery off the day's earlier mysterious plunge...\nLifting BTC to $444 highs, more than double the September levels when we suggested it. Notice the rally is on rapidly increasingly volumes also (as word spreads and ease of access is enabled)...\nAs we noted previously, this is the validation that, just as predicted here two months ago, bitcoin has become the go-to asset class for millions of Chinese savers seeking to quietly and under the radar transfer funds from point A to point B, whatever that may be, in the process circumventing the recently expanded governmental capital controls:\nWhile he didnt provide any concrete numbers, he did comment last week on what was driving the adoption. Some Chinese traders are expressing a view on the CNY exchange rate after the last devaluation and you have interest by mainland speculators to move to other assets after the stock market fallout, he explained in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\nWhich again brings us back to our conclusion from two months ago:\n... if a few hundred million Chinese decide that the time has come to use bitcoin as the capital controls bypassing currency of choice, and decide to invest even a tiny fraction of the $22 trillion in Chinese deposits in bitcoin (whose total market cap at last check was just over $3 billion), sit back and watch as we witness the second coming of the bitcoin bubble, one which could make the previous all time highs in the digital currency, seems like a low print.\nAs of this moment, the total value of bitcoin is up from the $3 billion two months ago to a little over $5 billion. That means the ratio of Chinese deposits (at around $22 trillion) to bitcoin, is down to a far more \"conservative\" 4,400x.\nAnd now, again, imagine what could happen if these same Chinese depositors realize they have been lied about the non-performing loans \"backing\" their deposits and that instead of the official 1.5% bad debt ratio, the real number is really far greater, somewhere in the 20% ballpark as we will show shortly, suggesting major deposit impairments are no longer the stuff of Cypriot nightmares but just the thing hundreds of millions of Chinese depositors have to look forward to, and that they have just two possible choices to avoid said impairment: reallocating their savings into bitcoin or, of course, gold.\n*  *  *\nHow will the Chinese regulators and government react to this? Especially as the volumes start to become relevant.\n", "author": "tmfp Legendary Online Activity: 1204 Merit: 1139 MLM: Many Layers of Misery "}], "date": "2015-11-05 09:19:10"}, {"content": "Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director, Bruce Fenton's AMA session and Big Announcement is taking place now at:\nhttps://forum.bitcoin.com/ama-ask-me-anything/i-m-bruce-fenton-bitcoin-loving-techo-econ-geek-ama-t2105.html\nLink to reddit submission:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rmp1q/bitcoin_foundation_executive_director_bruce/\n", "views": 440, "author": "MemoryDealers VIP Legendary Offline Activity: 1034 Merit: 1050 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin Foundation Executive Director, Bruce Fenton AMA!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-11-05 14:40:09", "content": "Good stuff Roger.

Some of these are:\nMost Filipinos earn about PHP300 or less for a full day's work.\nSmart phones (Android &amp; iPhone) ownership is not that prevalent with Filipinos, however it is slowly growing as their purchase price drops. Now you can get a second-hand one for about 3 to 5 days salary.\nInternet access costs PHP5 (about 10 minutes labour) per 15 minutes.\nFree WiFi is not readily available except in very limited locations in major cities.\nMost Filipinos are un-banked (cash is king) and do not trust/respect banks.\nVery few Filipinos have access to or have a credit/debit card, although those with a bank account do normally have an ATM card linked to their account(s).\nThere are very few businesses in the Philippines that accept bitcoin as payment. Those few that do are mainly in Manila.\nMost Filipinos are familiar with (and many use) pera padala (money remittance) businesses within the Philippines to send money between family and friends in the Philippines. Every major town and almost every small town has at least one pera padala business. These businesses accept cash, charge a fee of about 2% to 3%, and have cash available for the receiver to collect within a few minutes. Most of these remittance amounts are usually well below PHP5000 (about USD100).\nThe Philippines, with a population of over 100 million, is currently served by two major local bitcoin exchange businesses; coins.ph and BuyBitcoin. Both appear to be well operated, economical, and offer normal exchange services as well as some value-added services. When exchanging bitcoin into PHP, both offer bank deposits (free) and pick-up through pera padala businesses (for fee a little above what they are charged  by the para padala business).\nFor the short-term future, I see the main use of bitcoin in the Philippines to be for remittances into and out of the country.

Some of these are:\nMost Filipinos earn about PHP300 or less for a full day's work.\nSmart phones (Android &amp; iPhone) ownership is not that prevalent with Filipinos, however it is slowly growing as their purchase price drops. Now you can get a second-hand one for about 3 to 5 days salary.\nInternet access costs PHP5 (about 10 minutes labour) per 15 minutes.\nFree WiFi is not readily available except in very limited locations in major cities.\nMost Filipinos are un-banked (cash is king) and do not trust/respect banks.\nVery few Filipinos have access to or have a credit/debit card, although those with a bank account do normally have an ATM card linked to their account(s).\nThere are very few businesses in the Philippines that accept bitcoin as payment. Those few that do are mainly in Manila.\nMost Filipinos are familiar with (and many use) pera padala (money remittance) businesses within the Philippines to send money between family and friends in the Philippines. Every major town and almost every small town has at least one pera padala business. These businesses accept cash, charge a fee of about 2% to 3%, and have cash available for the receiver to collect within a few minutes. Most of these remittance amounts are usually well below PHP5000 (about USD100).\nThe Philippines, with a population of over 100 million, is currently served by two major local bitcoin exchange businesses; coins.ph and BuyBitcoin. Both appear to be well operated, economical, and offer normal exchange services as well as some value-added services. When exchanging bitcoin into PHP, both offer bank deposits (free) and pick-up through pera padala businesses (for fee a little above what they are charged  by the para padala business).\nFor the short-term future, I see the main use of bitcoin in the Philippines to be for remittances into and out of the country. Intra-country use will not develop until the Filipino can see an advantage in its use over cash.\nIt's true that most of the businesses that accept bitcoin are only distributed along the confines of the metros. Also, slow internet connection with such a ludicrous fee (I'm paying $50 for a 3Mbps turtle) is another hurdle when it comes to using bitcoin, given that the network runs through the internet. SMS, on the other hand, is very active within the Filipinos. If only they can make a wallet SMS-ready or transactions can be made through SMS, many Filipinos would consider using bitcoins as well. Also, the main thing that I see people here would use bitcoins is mainly for remittances. I experienced one time when my uncle sent money from Canada to Manila, it took 2 days for the process to complete (which is nuts, because I need the money that same day), whereas in bitcoin, you don't need to wait for that long because transactions are made within a span of minutes from anywhere in the world. That's a +1 for me because I have relatives in other parts of the world that often send money to us.\nExchanges here on the other hand, do little promotion and advertising. Coins.ph do the same promotion in Facebook among others, and tbh, coins.ph is a nice exchange because they really deliver their customers' needs. They also have great customer service that replies instantly and helps you with your problems. Some other exchanges, I'm not familiar with, but I haven't heard a single time in which they do some sh*t over their customers.\n", "author": "dothebeats Legendary Offline Activity: 1582 Merit: 1064 Deleted posts: 91 "}, {"date": "2015-05-02 07:29:47", "content": "Sound like you seem to promote coins.ph and BuyBitcoin, you should show the screen shoot of the exchange so that peoples will trust because the majority of users have not know that exchange,maybe can make it this exchange be in the know.\n", "author": "Kaneki Sr. Member Offline Activity: 252 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-05-02 09:40:21", "content": "Sound like you seem to promote coins.ph and BuyBitcoin, you should show the screen shoot of the exchange so that peoples will trust because the majority of users have not know that exchange,maybe can make it this exchange be in the know.\nThats right more on newbies haven't exchange.  If they trust and they dont know what is the value of their exchange,coins.ph abd buybitcoin.ph can outweigh the bitcoin users.

Check out the methods offered by the Filipino bitcoin exchanges. I would hazard a guess that 98% of Filipinos live within 30 minutes travel to one of these \"branch locations\".\nAs for \"instant\", it is not quite \"instant\". most Filipino bitcoin exchanges only do their banking/Pera Padala once a day on business days only, so \"instant\" at present can only mean within 8 business hours.\nAs the Filipino bitcoin exchange grows, I hope to see them arranging Pera Padala 7 days a week and multiple times a day. Then you could send bitcoin to the exchange Sunday morning and have the cash available for pick-up within a few hours the same day.\n", "author": "rbscebu Jr. Member Offline Activity: 39 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-06-22 01:31:01", "content": "I see the current Filipino bitcoin exchanges developing in two main directions over the near term; processing overseas remittances, and providing BTC to PHP conversions for Filipino businesses.\nThe current biggest growth potential for the exchanges is in remittances. As this Pera Padala business development grows, I believe that these exchanges need to start shifting their focus on getting Filipino businesses to start accepting bitcoin for payment of goods and services. This is not going to be easy and will take a lot of \"leg work\".\nOnce a Filipino merchant has been convinced to accept bitcoin, he/she then needs internet access at the point-of-sale (POS) and a smartphone/tablet/PC with suitable wallet to accept/tansact the payment. I see it working this way:\n1.  Business gives the customer the price converted to BTC at the current exchange buy rate.\n2.  Customer logs on to WiFi at POS and sends the BTC to the merchant's wallet QR code displayed at the POS.\n3.  The merchant checks the payments confirmation(s) in his wallet and, once suitable confirmation is received, passes over the goods/service paid for to the customer.\n4.  At (say) the end of the day, the merchant uses his bitcoin exchange to convert the BTC takings into PHP and have that deposited into his/her bank account within 8 business hours.\nOne of the problems here is the confirmation time. This is mainly to prevent \"double spending\". It would be up to the merchant to determine what is an acceptable confirmation. For smaller transactions, just being seen by one or two peers may be sufficient confirmation, taking just a few seconds. The larger the transaction, the more confirmations would be needed, taking more time.\nAnother problem is the exchange rate volatility, which can go up as well as down.The bitcoin exchanges offer a few ways to eliminate this volatility.\nThe advantages for the merchant include:\nNo credit/debit card fees/commissions.\nLess work/costs associated with handling cash.\nGood business promotion - at least initially while few merchants accept BTC.\nNow, if only SM would accept BTC!\n", "author": "rbscebu Jr. Member Offline Activity: 39 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-06-22 22:49:00", "content": "well some country is taking the advantage of bitcoin already what is needed to others follow instead block it?\n", "author": "knowhow Hero Member Offline Activity: 560 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-06-23 01:23:12", "content": "well some country is taking the advantage of bitcoin already what is needed to others follow instead block it?\nYes and i think phillipines can adopt bitcoin in 2016 because we have a new president and as filipino citizen we can introduce bitcoin to new president .\n", "author": "Dotakels Sr. Member Offline Activity: 462 Merit: 255 "}, {"date": "2015-06-23 08:15:55", "content": "School tuitions in some universities can be paid by bitcoin now here in Philipines.

Now you can get a second-hand one for about 3 to 5 days salary.\nInternet access costs PHP5 (about 10 minutes labour) per 15 minutes.\nFree WiFi is not readily available except in very limited locations in major cities.\nMost Filipinos are un-banked (cash is king) and do not trust/respect banks.\nVery few Filipinos have access to or have a credit/debit card, although those with a bank account do normally have an ATM card linked to their account(s).\nThere are very few businesses in the Philippines that accept bitcoin as payment. Those few that do are mainly in Manila.\nMost Filipinos are familiar with (and many use) pera padala (money remittance) businesses within the Philippines to send money between family and friends in the Philippines. Every major town and almost every small town has at least one pera padala business. These businesses accept cash, charge a fee of about 2% to 3%, and have cash available for the receiver to collect within a few minutes. Most of these remittance amounts are usually well below PHP5000 (about USD100).\nThe Philippines, with a population of over 100 million, is currently served by two major local bitcoin exchange businesses; coins.ph and BuyBitcoin. Both appear to be well operated, economical, and offer normal exchange services as well as some value-added services. When exchanging bitcoin into PHP, both offer bank deposits (free) and pick-up through pera padala businesses (for fee a little above what they are charged  by the para padala business).\nFor the short-term future, I see the main use of bitcoin in the Philippines to be for remittances into and out of the country. Intra-country use will not develop until the Filipino can see an advantage in its use over cash.\nRemittance out of the Philippines via Bitcoin is in demand as wiring money out is expensive and subject to all sorts of government interference and investigation, but remittance to the Philippines will be hard to compete with. For example when I had an employee there under a 6mos contract I simply walked into Metrobank here in Canada and paid less than $10 to deliver cash directly to his house same day service. Localbitcoin trading was a problem because of security, there was nowhere he could go and change around $500USD worth of cash in public without getting jacked by criminals watching unless you live around Makati secure areas.\n", "author": "moni3z Hero Member Offline Activity: 886 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-07-12 15:24:11", "content": "slowly i think Filipinos will accept use of\nBTC\nbut not in the province side\nmore likely in huge developed cities\ni even tried to explain it to my friend and i ended up giving up because of the questions being raised\nYes and I think that many of the people are not having bank accounts in philippines so bitcoin would serve their purpose they can easily use it for shopping and stuff and they dont require bank account for that so it can create an revolution in philippines and I believe the government should make it legal.\nIt's legal here in PH .Plus even without bitcoin people here can do shopping without bankaccount.

But a group of bitcoin enthusiasts here in the PH are raising awareness about bitcoin.\nThe group MMM Community in the Philippines is providing a big contribution in Bitcoin awareness in since they are the only MLM (i think) who accepts and pays in Bitcoin. I hope other MLM companies follow and introduce Bitcoin to more people in Ph. I \"heard\" Metrodeal (group buying site) is also accepting Bitcoins as payment.\nIf Metrodeal would be implementing the addition of bitcoin as payment option, then it would be very awesome! It would be more convenient for people who uses bitcoins!\nIts a great help for users of bitcoin because they can buy stuffs without exchange their coins into fiat money, and also its a great help to the economy of the philippines because it can avoid the delay of payment and also foreigners can spend their coins in philippines.\nYes it would definitely help the economy of philippines and the great benefit would be for the visitors from different countries who visits philippines and as bitcoins are accepted, they don't have to convert their currency into local currency which would save the conversion cost.\nYes also they can save the transaction fee, and this can help the adoption and usage of bitcoin in philippines, And it can affect the gdp of the country.\n", "author": "Dotakels Sr. Member Offline Activity: 462 Merit: 255 "}, {"date": "2015-07-19 18:51:08", "content": "I just wondered who Pinoy's here attends the meetups/seminars of a one of the bitcoin group in Philippines last Saturday.

Now some of the shops are telling me \"No, not yet, but we are looking into it\".\nOne day I will ask and get the response \"Yes sir\".\nAbout 10% of Filipinos are OFW's. Their remittances back to the Philippines total some USD50 billion annually [ref. BSP], with a little under a half of that going through the official banking system. The rest comes through the likes of Western Union.\nThe availability of bitcoin to OFW's is dependent on where they are based and their knowledge of how to obtain bitcoin. I know a few Filipino families with OFW's helping with support. I have contacted their OFW's to suggest that they consider bitcoin for their remittances back to the family. Even with a saving of %5 or more, all said it was just to much trouble.\nAs a side note, I was recently in Bengbu, China on business. Bitcoin is in demand there. It was fairly easy to find someone who wanted to exchange CNY for bitcoin - and at a premium of 5% to 10% above the market rate.\n", "author": "rbscebu Jr. Member Offline Activity: 39 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2015-09-22 12:47:37", "content": "Bitcoin is ripe for mass adoption in the Philippines, but only after some major hurdles can be addressed.

This afternoon's sudden BIS-induced plunge, taking the virtual currency down $50, has been entirely retraced and more as BTCC (China's leading Bitcoin Exchange) announced it will now accept direct deposits (making it significantly easier for Chinese to rotate their Yuan deposits into the virtual currency and out of the potential clutches of capital controlling communists).\nAs BTCC details,\nRecent bitcoin price increases have reignited enthusiasm in buying bitcoin. BTCC is confident this trend will continue. As such, we are pleased to announce that we now accept direct deposits.\nCustomers now need only log in, click on Account, then Fund, and then select the Bank Deposit option to fund their BTCC accounts through their bank accounts. All customers who have Chinese bank accounts will be able to make direct deposits through ATM transfers or online banking.\nAnd adds, even more crucially...\nBTCC will stop accepting customer deposits through agents on November 15.\nWhich appeared to provide further dip-buying impetus to the recovery off the day's earlier mysterious plunge...\nLifting BTC to $444 highs, more than double the September levels when we suggested it. Notice the rally is on rapidly increasingly volumes also (as word spreads and ease of access is enabled)...\nAs we noted previously, this is the validation that, just as predicted here two months ago, bitcoin has become the go-to asset class for millions of Chinese savers seeking to quietly and under the radar transfer funds from point A to point B, whatever that may be, in the process circumventing the recently expanded governmental capital controls:\nWhile he didnt provide any concrete numbers, he did comment last week on what was driving the adoption. Some Chinese traders are expressing a view on the CNY exchange rate after the last devaluation and you have interest by mainland speculators to move to other assets after the stock market fallout, he explained in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine.\nWhich again brings us back to our conclusion from two months ago:\n... if a few hundred million Chinese decide that the time has come to use bitcoin as the capital controls bypassing currency of choice, and decide to invest even a tiny fraction of the $22 trillion in Chinese deposits in bitcoin (whose total market cap at last check was just over $3 billion), sit back and watch as we witness the second coming of the bitcoin bubble, one which could make the previous all time highs in the digital currency, seems like a low print.\nAs of this moment, the total value of bitcoin is up from the $3 billion two months ago to a little over $5 billion. That means the ratio of Chinese deposits (at around $22 trillion) to bitcoin, is down to a far more \"conservative\" 4,400x.\nAnd now, again, imagine what could happen if these same Chinese depositors realize they have been lied about the non-performing loans \"backing\" their deposits and that instead of the official 1.5% bad debt ratio, the real number is really far greater, somewhere in the 20% ballpark as we will show shortly, suggesting major deposit impairments are no longer the stuff of Cypriot nightmares but just the thing hundreds of millions of Chinese depositors have to look forward to, and that they have just two possible choices to avoid said impairment: reallocating their savings into bitcoin or, of course, gold.\n*  *  *\nHow will the Chinese regulators and government react to this? Especially as the volumes start to become relevant.\n", "author": "tmfp Legendary Online Activity: 1204 Merit: 1139 MLM: Many Layers of Misery "}], "date": "2015-11-05 09:19:10"}, {"content": "Bitcoin Foundation Executive Director, Bruce Fenton's AMA session and Big Announcement is taking place now at:\nhttps://forum.bitcoin.com/ama-ask-me-anything/i-m-bruce-fenton-bitcoin-loving-techo-econ-geek-ama-t2105.html\nLink to reddit submission:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rmp1q/bitcoin_foundation_executive_director_bruce/\n", "views": 440, "author": "MemoryDealers VIP Legendary Offline Activity: 1034 Merit: 1050 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBitcoin Foundation Executive Director, Bruce Fenton AMA!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-11-05 14:40:09", "content": "Good stuff Roger.

In hindsight, Uber is a pretty obvious thing, but still somebody had not just to think about, but also developing it(I also have a lot of ideas, which might be huge, but just don't have the guts to invest time and money to actually develop them).\nSo, the bitcoin killer/app could already be developed in someone's mum's basement, there might even be an introduction of the project in this forum and everybody is just like \"Nah, that won't work/Nobody really needs that\" and six months from now, with the right press coverage, Millions of people use it(and everybody on this forum will tell you, that the idea was obvious). Could be, might be.\n", "author": "turvarya Hero Member Offline Activity: 714 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-11-05 07:46:55", "content": "I would not call it a Hero App, but rather just stay with the Killer App that could take it viral.
