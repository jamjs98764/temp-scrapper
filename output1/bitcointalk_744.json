Remember why you got into bitcoin in the first place\nIt's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day happenings in the industry and forget about the big picture. This could be demotivating and frustrating at times, but at the end of the day we have to remind ourselves that we're dedicating our time and energy towards one of the most exciting inventions of our time, and believe it or not, we're all (still) early adopters.\n2. Don't measure bitcoin by its price\nOf course the price of bitcoin is fundamental to its value, but it's not the only thing that makes bitcoin valuable. Regardless of its price, remember that bitcoin allows you to send money anywhere for next to nothing. Remember that millions of unbanked people around the world have the ability to manage their finances in a stable and secure way for the first time with bitcoin.\n3. Try not to get caught up in the media hype  good or bad\nStaying up-to-date with the latest in the industry is essential (and I wouldn't have a job if you didn't - so please do), but it's important to remember that while stories like Mt Gox imploding or Microsoft accepting bitcoin do have an effect on the industry, the most important thing with bitcoin is that its core technology stays secure and that people keep using the digital currency.\n4. Keep doing your best work for the industry\nWhether you work at a bitcoin startup, are building something on the blockchain in your down time or actively spread awareness of bitcoin, stay diligent about consistently doing your best work. This will benefit both you personally and the broader industry, and productivity pays off!\n5. Learn more about how bitcoin works\nPart of doing your best work for the industry involves being an expert on bitcoin and how it fits into the real world. Maybe you're a development expert but could devote more time to learning about finance and economics. Or perhaps you know everything about the legal system and how regulation works but ought to better understand how bitcoin works 'under the hood'. Either way, honing your expertise is a benefit both for you and for bitcoin.\n6. Perfect your elevator pitch\nIt's important to be able to explain what bitcoin is and how it works in a (somewhat) brief amount of time. Friends, family and strangers will all be curious about this mystical digital currency and will have plenty of questions, so being prepared with a concise and understandable explanation will help you spread awareness in a productive way.\n7. Convince others to get involved\nBitcoin is still a grassroots community. Many bitcoiners (myself included) are eager to spread the word about bitcoin to friends and family, and if you've followed resolution number six, you'll have the perfect pitch to spark your audience's interest.\n8. Attend at least one bitcoin conference or meet-up\nIf you're not fortunate enough to have friends or family who love bitcoin as much as you, going to a conference or meet-up is a great way to meet others with the same passion as you and to network with people in the industry. Oftentimes meet-ups are a great place to share ideas with fellow entrepreneurs, so if you've got a business idea and are looking for co-founders, there's opportunity to be had.\n9. Make an effort to spend bitcoin whenever possible\nWith daily transaction volume at or near its peak, spending bitcoin wherever possible will only help expand its economy, and paying with bitcoin helps reassure and support merchants who support the industry. It doesn't have to be a completely selfless action, though  there are plenty of times when paying with bitcoin is just easier than the alternatives.\n10. Go outside your comfort zone\nHowever it happens, we should all embrace change  especially considering the amount of change that bitcoin could bring. Whether you've always dreamed of leaving your job to get involved with bitcoin full-time or you've been hoping to connect with a VC or startup company, avoid complacency in your life. Make smart and well-informed decisions about everything you do, but still take calculated risks if you feel it's worth it, and go forth with your best foot forward.\nDedicate #9 to all the hold-hard-never-spenders\n", "views": 495, "author": "pawel7777 Legendary Offline Activity: 1680 Merit: 1066 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10 Bitcoin Resolutions for 2015\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-01-03 13:06:53", "content": "It doesn't have to be a completely selfless action, though  there are plenty of times when paying with bitcoin is just easier than the alternatives.\nGood point: when I pay with credit card, I have to monitor my credit card account to figure out how much I owe the credit card company.

We humans have many weaknesses. Maybe he follows a specific politic path, or maybe he is from a specific country some other countries are suspicious of and that might be enough to lose BILLIONS of followers. Maybe he is alcoholic or has any kind of weakness. A creator perpetually on the magazines will only be bad for bitcoin. He might have a lover or two or who cares. I think it is better if he is a ghost. I seriously don't care where he goes on holidays. He for sure is not an angel or a perfect human. Also many people just viewing satoshi nakamoto's face alone will just not like him. It is human nature. Leave him alone.\nActually people talks a lot about how antifragile bitcoin is. I think it is really fragile. Let's imagine that USA wants to destroy bitcoin. They will only have to create a movie (like the movie about facebook) about satoshi nakamoto and how CIA created the coin. or instead of a movie, just create four or five docs on national greographic about it. Even being a lie, millions would avoid bitcoin only on the suspicion that CIA created it with some hidden reason. Just give it two or three oscars after that and you will have widespread adoption of the bitcoin cia origins.

The user uses an information group containing the signed user information, the signed authentication information, the user information and the authentication information, as electronic cash for payment to a shop. The shop verifies the validity of the signed user information and the signed authentication information, and produces and sends to the user an inquiry. In response to the inquiry the user produces a response Yi by using secret information and random information and sends it to the shop.

Remember why you got into bitcoin in the first place\nIt's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day happenings in the industry and forget about the big picture. This could be demotivating and frustrating at times, but at the end of the day we have to remind ourselves that we're dedicating our time and energy towards one of the most exciting inventions of our time, and believe it or not, we're all (still) early adopters.\n2. Don't measure bitcoin by its price\nOf course the price of bitcoin is fundamental to its value, but it's not the only thing that makes bitcoin valuable. Regardless of its price, remember that bitcoin allows you to send money anywhere for next to nothing. Remember that millions of unbanked people around the world have the ability to manage their finances in a stable and secure way for the first time with bitcoin.\n3. Try not to get caught up in the media hype  good or bad\nStaying up-to-date with the latest in the industry is essential (and I wouldn't have a job if you didn't - so please do), but it's important to remember that while stories like Mt Gox imploding or Microsoft accepting bitcoin do have an effect on the industry, the most important thing with bitcoin is that its core technology stays secure and that people keep using the digital currency.\n4. Keep doing your best work for the industry\nWhether you work at a bitcoin startup, are building something on the blockchain in your down time or actively spread awareness of bitcoin, stay diligent about consistently doing your best work. This will benefit both you personally and the broader industry, and productivity pays off!\n5. Learn more about how bitcoin works\nPart of doing your best work for the industry involves being an expert on bitcoin and how it fits into the real world. Maybe you're a development expert but could devote more time to learning about finance and economics. Or perhaps you know everything about the legal system and how regulation works but ought to better understand how bitcoin works 'under the hood'. Either way, honing your expertise is a benefit both for you and for bitcoin.\n6. Perfect your elevator pitch\nIt's important to be able to explain what bitcoin is and how it works in a (somewhat) brief amount of time. Friends, family and strangers will all be curious about this mystical digital currency and will have plenty of questions, so being prepared with a concise and understandable explanation will help you spread awareness in a productive way.\n7. Convince others to get involved\nBitcoin is still a grassroots community. Many bitcoiners (myself included) are eager to spread the word about bitcoin to friends and family, and if you've followed resolution number six, you'll have the perfect pitch to spark your audience's interest.\n8. Attend at least one bitcoin conference or meet-up\nIf you're not fortunate enough to have friends or family who love bitcoin as much as you, going to a conference or meet-up is a great way to meet others with the same passion as you and to network with people in the industry. Oftentimes meet-ups are a great place to share ideas with fellow entrepreneurs, so if you've got a business idea and are looking for co-founders, there's opportunity to be had.\n9. Make an effort to spend bitcoin whenever possible\nWith daily transaction volume at or near its peak, spending bitcoin wherever possible will only help expand its economy, and paying with bitcoin helps reassure and support merchants who support the industry. It doesn't have to be a completely selfless action, though  there are plenty of times when paying with bitcoin is just easier than the alternatives.\n10. Go outside your comfort zone\nHowever it happens, we should all embrace change  especially considering the amount of change that bitcoin could bring. Whether you've always dreamed of leaving your job to get involved with bitcoin full-time or you've been hoping to connect with a VC or startup company, avoid complacency in your life. Make smart and well-informed decisions about everything you do, but still take calculated risks if you feel it's worth it, and go forth with your best foot forward.\nDedicate #9 to all the hold-hard-never-spenders\n", "views": 495, "author": "pawel7777 Legendary Offline Activity: 1680 Merit: 1066 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10 Bitcoin Resolutions for 2015\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-01-03 13:06:53", "content": "It doesn't have to be a completely selfless action, though  there are plenty of times when paying with bitcoin is just easier than the alternatives.\nGood point: when I pay with credit card, I have to monitor my credit card account to figure out how much I owe the credit card company.

I think it is really fragile. Let's imagine that USA wants to destroy bitcoin. They will only have to create a movie (like the movie about facebook) about satoshi nakamoto and how CIA created the coin. or instead of a movie, just create four or five docs on national greographic about it. Even being a lie, millions would avoid bitcoin only on the suspicion that CIA created it with some hidden reason. Just give it two or three oscars after that and you will have widespread adoption of the bitcoin cia origins. Billions might not like to move from petrodollar to Cia's coin.\nLeave him alone.\n", "author": "telemaco Sr. Member Offline Activity: 371 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2013-06-16 11:13:49", "content": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhwkcdlyvHE\n", "author": "4mherewego Full Member Offline Activity: 220 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2013-06-16 11:31:11", "content": "Tatsuaki Okamoto out of the suggested people definitely has the best chances so far to be Satoshi, there are a whole lot of similarities.\n", "author": "Geez Jr. Member Offline Activity: 54 Merit: 0 "}, {"date": "2013-06-16 11:33:52", "content": "we must come in contact with him\n", "author": "aceking Full Member Offline Activity: 229 Merit: 100 "}, {"date": "2013-06-16 13:58:07", "content": "This doesn't make sense at all.

I would say that buying and spending bitcoin whenever you can would have a greater benefit to bitcoin as merchants would realize greater sales and their competitors would take notice and potentially also start to accept bitcoin (and potentially offer discounts for paying in bitcoin which will further drive consumer adoption)\n", "author": "charlieSeen Sr. Member Offline Activity: 241 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-01-01 10:30:23", "content": "You have a talent, use it. This place is a treasure trove of ideas but short on execution. Go to the Project Discussion forum and read through a few projects going on, contribute to one of those.\nOr, take your specialty at work and figure out how it can be done better with bitcoins.\nIt is like someone asking in 1995 how they can contribute to the Internet to make it better because they like the concept. The Internet did not need much development itself, it needed people to take their real world talents and put them on the Internet. Whether this was the pet shop owner deciding to make an online store or a computer programmer helping people make web pages. The Internet did not need pet shop owners continuing their pet store business while on the side learning TCP/IP routing protocols to maximize efficiency of the network.\nTransform your career to use bitcoin so that it is not a side thing.\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2015-01-01 13:52:42", "content": "Buy Bitcoins and use them!!\n", "author": "Mickeyb Hero Member Offline Activity: 798 Merit: 1000 Move On !!!!!!
