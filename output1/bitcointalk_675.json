Our bitcoin related info and shop sites are not pretty enough, are too convoluted, technical, and look too amateur to be accepted by a flock of non-tech newcomers. We need to get a lot closer to Apple's design sense to get the hipster crowd, who would be most likely among non-nerds to get into the market. Practically every site looks beta right now. This is not acceptable to the hipster crowd. On the software side, running command lines is instant turnoff to the non-tech-savvy-majority.\nUnderstandably all of the btc related companies are pretty short on money but they need to find a way to get all of the GUIs and shopping sites to come out looking like something in the 'normal' online business world. Who cares if a programmer can hack and is a linux guru. The public wants graphic artists so bitcoin doesn't look sketchy.\nShoutout to the guy behind bitcoincharts.com, that site looks real nice for the more advanced investor and has no 'bitcoin site handicap' imo. It stands up against any trading statistic site. It's the sites doing the exchanging of btc that bother me. Hope someone finds the capital/time to get the next revisions of homepages looking nice.

The rent goes to my bank account which I send to the mortgage company each month. I need to figure out this last piece of the puzzle. Australia already has a Bitcoin bill pay company, hopefully someone in the US sets one up.\nI pay cash for my rent here which includes utilities, so all I need money for is food and gas.

My only bills are my rent, my mortgage (which is being paid by an incoming rent check) and gas/food. My rent is about $1k euro which is nice since the euro has fallen a lot against the dollar. Gas costs me about $50 per month, food about 200 euro. My monthly income is over 5 times those monthly bills.\nIf I want to play it safe, I spend my bitcoins as close to payday as possible. I bought a video game yesterday and by spending bitcoins I got an 8% discount. The price was down about 5% from Friday, so I still come out ahead.\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2015-01-20 19:47:33", "content": "I set up my direct deposit to the account number they provided me...\nI wonder if this can be done with other things that are not exactly wages?

If you are not in the U.S., you need to do something similar with whatever forms you use. The exceptions are that if you are NOT in a common law country, or if the language is not English, do your research before you do this that I am about to tell you.\n1. Download and print out a 2015 W-4. You can find it located here\nhttp://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf\n.\n2. Write out the W-4 in longhand. Fill in your name, address and SSN in all caps. Do it in blue ink by writing it out yourself, by hand, rather than filling in the blanks using a computer or typewriter.\n3. Over the marriage status section print the word \"non-assumpsit\" in lower case. Don't check any of the marriage status boxes.\n4. In the number \"4\" box, print \"non-assumpsit\" as in the number \"3\" box.\n5. In the big box that holds numbers 5, 6, and 7, print \"non-assumpsit\" across it. On the number \"7\" line, print \"exempt\" in lower case.\n6. Sign and date as usual, except that I would recommend signing in all lower case... even the first letters of each part of your name.\nNOTE: Be sure that you have filled all this out by hand, in blue ink, without using a computer and printer.\n7. Make, say, a half dozen\ncolor\ncopies.\n8. Keep the original unaltered in your personal files at home or wherever. Print the word \"COPY,\" slanted, and in red, across each of the 6 copies. Or use a \"COPY\" stamp that you can buy at an office supply store.\n9. Certify mail, return receipt, a copy to your employer. If you work for a large company/corporation, you might mail several copies, one to the CFO of the company, another to the accounting department, a third to your local place of employment if you work at a branch of your company that is not the main branch.\nNon-assumpsit means \"no contract.\"\nGenerally, your employer is supposed to keep W-4 on file, except if the IRS requests a copy of it.\nIf your employer continues to withhold taxes after you have done this, you have a legitimate legal claim against your employer. If you don't work for the government, your employer is supposed to obey your wishes as listed on the W-4.\nIf your employer decides to deduct, the deductions must NOT be withheld from your paycheck. Rather, they must be separate funds that your employer sends to the IRS per any agreement he has with them.\nIf the IRS tells him to disregard your W-4... they don't have the authority to overrule your wishes. Your agreement for pay is between you and your employer. If he withholds, you have a legitimate legal claim against him.\nI'm not going to go into the details of method for making your legal claim. It starts with a batch of letter writing to the CFO as a man, not as the CFO. You give him time to respond by seeing to it that you receive your withheld pay. Ultimately if he is the person who has the authority to see to it that you are paid, you make a claim that you have been damaged, that he has done wrong to you, that he has stolen your property. Do this like you would with any common thief. Or do it like you would for your neighbor who stole a valuable tool of yours and won't return it.\nUse common sense in writing your letters. Be friendly and gracious, to the point and brief. Finally, if he won't respond, serve notice on him using a process server. Then start a common law (court of record) proceeding against him, man to man, not man to company Chief Financial Officer. Why not to the CFO? Because a CFO without the man can't do anything. It is the man using the office of the CFO who is damaging you.\nUltimately, if the CFO man will not respond by giving you your property (pay) including expenses entailed for process server, etc., take him to court, man to man, not in his office as CFO.\nSearch through the Youtube files here\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/765736/videos?view=0&amp;live_view=500&amp;flow=grid&amp;sort=da\nand here\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5duR4OvEHHxOSdEZhANETw\nand here\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwyBESRGpm1vZRErvtSmNGg\nfor info that you might do to accomplish the law suit properly.\n", "author": "BADecker Legendary Online Activity: 1792 Merit: 1046 "}, {"date": "2015-02-03 20:29:22", "content": "I would recommend using bitreserve.org where you can hold your bitcoin in dollars or pounds so you are protected against volatility your money would stay the same in $ or £\nbut its on the bitcoin network\n.\nOf course this is a lie.\nWhen you give your bitcoins to somebody else, they sell them on the market and hold $ or £.\nWhen you want your money returned, they buy back the $ or £ value at current market prices and give them back to you.\nGiving your bitcoins to somebody else to hold on for you \"protected against volatility\" is loaning your coins to short sellers, except in this case you generally pay them for the privilege of borrowing your coins to short with instead of getting paid interest.\n", "author": "justusranvier Legendary Offline Activity: 1400 Merit: 1006 "}, {"date": "2015-02-03 22:58:36", "content": "Imagine your paycheck was generated during a flash crash... oh my..\n", "author": "Ghepetto Sr. Member Offline Activity: 249 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-02-04 08:39:17", "content": "2) Both my employer and me should have tax release for an amount converted into BTC as this could be treated as company benefit.\nIf you are simply employed, rather than holding independent contractor status, fill out a new W-4 form every time the IRS comes out with a new one.

Of course, that is the \"hard fork\" way of doing it. There are other ways such as the Luke Jr code (which I mentioned before I removed it) that you can download and refuse to propagate those TX's (I believe this can still be done today if you included his fixes, which refuses to TX gambling sites and other things that he considered blockchain bloat).\n", "author": "TheMage Hero Member Offline Activity: 812 Merit: 1000 Litecoin Association Director "}, {"date": "2015-07-10 06:14:23", "content": "Wow that took a while to read, but it's very informative.

You also need to talk and discuss openly but also need to come to a conclusion and know why it's being done. It also depends on how established a Coin is, if it were a small Coin just starting out then it wouldn't be much trouble to gain consensus from a handful of holders and one exchange.\nI hardforked PayCon in 5 days but had all exchanges and services updated and more than 70% of users move to the new fork in 24 hours. I was able to do this by creating a new OP, having the hardfork ready, having the wallets and any fallbacks in place, then contacting everyone through either private message or talking to all exchanges directly. I said \"This is the new OP, this is the new Github, these are your new wallets, this is a hardfork that will fix the difficulty problem, give you more Coins and has some nicer aesthetics.\"\nhttp://www.presstab.pw/phpexplorer/paycon/charts.php?type=annualrate\nThat was a bit of circumstance though because if you have a problem of the guy running the show is leaving and you have a Blockchain problem and someone else come in to fix the problem and change the rewards to be higher for everyone, then most would just take the chance and even be thrilled about it because suddenly getting more for what you already paid for and have no alternative anyways.\nWhat would be your choice then?\nOption 1\nOption 2\nThe thing is that people\nwant\nsomeone to make the hard decisions for them and serve it on a silver platter and probably doesn't really matter how you fork a Coin as long as it's purpose is for the betterment of investors.\nIn the case of reverting and reversing transactions, that would come down to circumstance. Neither the reversal of Vericoin or the non-reversal of NXT was wrong, in both cases a decision was made. There are incidents of Blocking addresses you should add as well, CommunityCoin blocked a premine address, MaryJanecoin blocked the C-Cex burn address, and SaturnCoin2 once blocked Cryptsy when they released a wallet that blocked an address they thought was a bad actor (oops) but never told anyone about it.\n", "author": "Crestington Legendary Offline Activity: 868 Merit: 1020 "}], "date": "2015-07-09 23:29:14"}, {"content": "Is there any online bitcoin privatekey import service ?\n", "views": 715, "author": "ammy009 Sr. Member Offline Activity: 305 Merit: 250 ★Pi Coin★ [POS+POW] [NO ICO] !

It is recommended to upgrade to this version.\nPlease report bugs using the issue tracker at github:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues\nUpgrading and downgrading\n=========================\nHow to Upgrade\n--------------\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\nbitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nDowngrade warning\n------------------\nBecause release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and\nparallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not\nbackwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:\n* Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are\nreceived, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or\nother programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work\nanymore as a result of this.\n* The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is\nstored on disk, which earlier versions won't support.\nIf you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data\ndirectory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from\nbootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely\nsynchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not\nsupported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.\nThis does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.\nNotable changes\n===============\nThis is a minor release and hence there are no notable changes.\nFor the notable changes in 0.10, refer to the release notes for the\n0.10.0 release at\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0/doc/release-notes.md\n0.10.1 Change log\n=================\nDetailed release notes follow.

I can just change addresses in a year and start spending this income.\nIf you are a U.S. citizen, you must pay capital gains at the U.S. rate.\nYes, as long as I follow the same process of FIFO or LIFO.  I think LIFO makes it easier for keeping close to the price I paid when I spend.\n", "author": "Elwar Legendary Offline Activity: 2576 Merit: 1250 www.varyon.io "}, {"date": "2015-01-08 17:32:34", "content": "Just save some FIAT\nIn bitcoin world,we never know what might happen\n", "author": "dmugetsu Member Offline Activity: 105 Merit: 10 "}, {"date": "2015-01-08 19:16:25", "content": "That's awesome\nI frankly would not have the guts to commit more than 10-205 of my fiat earnings to btc\nI also do not, not today.

If you are not in the U.S., you need to do something similar with whatever forms you use. The exceptions are that if you are NOT in a common law country, or if the language is not English, do your research before you do this that I am about to tell you.\n1. Download and print out a 2015 W-4. You can find it located here\nhttp://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf\n.\n2. Write out the W-4 in longhand. Fill in your name, address and SSN in all caps. Do it in blue ink by writing it out yourself, by hand, rather than filling in the blanks using a computer or typewriter.\n3. Over the marriage status section print the word \"non-assumpsit\" in lower case. Don't check any of the marriage status boxes.\n4. In the number \"4\" box, print \"non-assumpsit\" as in the number \"3\" box.\n5. In the big box that holds numbers 5, 6, and 7, print \"non-assumpsit\" across it. On the number \"7\" line, print \"exempt\" in lower case.\n6. Sign and date as usual, except that I would recommend signing in all lower case... even the first letters of each part of your name.\nNOTE: Be sure that you have filled all this out by hand, in blue ink, without using a computer and printer.\n7. Make, say, a half dozen\ncolor\ncopies.\n8. Keep the original unaltered in your personal files at home or wherever. Print the word \"COPY,\" slanted, and in red, across each of the 6 copies. Or use a \"COPY\" stamp that you can buy at an office supply store.\n9. Certify mail, return receipt, a copy to your employer. If you work for a large company/corporation, you might mail several copies, one to the CFO of the company, another to the accounting department, a third to your local place of employment if you work at a branch of your company that is not the main branch.\nNon-assumpsit means \"no contract.\"\nGenerally, your employer is supposed to keep W-4 on file, except if the IRS requests a copy of it.\nIf your employer continues to withhold taxes after you have done this, you have a legitimate legal claim against your employer. If you don't work for the government, your employer is supposed to obey your wishes as listed on the W-4.\nIf your employer decides to deduct, the deductions must NOT be withheld from your paycheck. Rather, they must be separate funds that your employer sends to the IRS per any agreement he has with them.\nIf the IRS tells him to disregard your W-4... they don't have the authority to overrule your wishes. Your agreement for pay is between you and your employer. If he withholds, you have a legitimate legal claim against him.\nI'm not going to go into the details of method for making your legal claim. It starts with a batch of letter writing to the CFO as a man, not as the CFO. You give him time to respond by seeing to it that you receive your withheld pay. Ultimately if he is the person who has the authority to see to it that you are paid, you make a claim that you have been damaged, that he has done wrong to you, that he has stolen your property. Do this like you would with any common thief. Or do it like you would for your neighbor who stole a valuable tool of yours and won't return it.\nUse common sense in writing your letters. Be friendly and gracious, to the point and brief. Finally, if he won't respond, serve notice on him using a process server. Then start a common law (court of record) proceeding against him, man to man, not man to company Chief Financial Officer. Why not to the CFO? Because a CFO without the man can't do anything. It is the man using the office of the CFO who is damaging you.\nUltimately, if the CFO man will not respond by giving you your property (pay) including expenses entailed for process server, etc., take him to court, man to man, not in his office as CFO.\nSearch through the Youtube files here\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/765736/videos?view=0&amp;live_view=500&amp;flow=grid&amp;sort=da\nand here\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5duR4OvEHHxOSdEZhANETw\nand here\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwyBESRGpm1vZRErvtSmNGg\nfor info that you might do to accomplish the law suit properly.\n", "author": "BADecker Legendary Online Activity: 1792 Merit: 1046 "}, {"date": "2015-02-03 20:29:22", "content": "I would recommend using bitreserve.org where you can hold your bitcoin in dollars or pounds so you are protected against volatility your money would stay the same in $ or £\nbut its on the bitcoin network\n.\nOf course this is a lie.\nWhen you give your bitcoins to somebody else, they sell them on the market and hold $ or £.\nWhen you want your money returned, they buy back the $ or £ value at current market prices and give them back to you.\nGiving your bitcoins to somebody else to hold on for you \"protected against volatility\" is loaning your coins to short sellers, except in this case you generally pay them for the privilege of borrowing your coins to short with instead of getting paid interest.\n", "author": "justusranvier Legendary Offline Activity: 1400 Merit: 1006 "}, {"date": "2015-02-03 22:58:36", "content": "Imagine your paycheck was generated during a flash crash... oh my..\n", "author": "Ghepetto Sr. Member Offline Activity: 249 Merit: 250 "}, {"date": "2015-02-04 08:39:17", "content": "2) Both my employer and me should have tax release for an amount converted into BTC as this could be treated as company benefit.\nIf you are simply employed, rather than holding independent contractor status, fill out a new W-4 form every time the IRS comes out with a new one.

You also need to talk and discuss openly but also need to come to a conclusion and know why it's being done. It also depends on how established a Coin is, if it were a small Coin just starting out then it wouldn't be much trouble to gain consensus from a handful of holders and one exchange.\nI hardforked PayCon in 5 days but had all exchanges and services updated and more than 70% of users move to the new fork in 24 hours. I was able to do this by creating a new OP, having the hardfork ready, having the wallets and any fallbacks in place, then contacting everyone through either private message or talking to all exchanges directly.

Neither the reversal of Vericoin or the non-reversal of NXT was wrong, in both cases a decision was made.

Bitcoin posed a good standing in there when it comes to speed and fees. Because of bitcoin, other payment processing giants changed their system into a much more faster (?) and lower fees (?).

It is recommended to upgrade to this version.\nPlease report bugs using the issue tracker at github:\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues\nUpgrading and downgrading\n=========================\nHow to Upgrade\n--------------\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or\nbitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).\nDowngrade warning\n------------------\nBecause release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and\nparallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not\nbackwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:\n* Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are\nreceived, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or\nother programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work\nanymore as a result of this.\n* The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is\nstored on disk, which earlier versions won't support.\nIf you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data\ndirectory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from\nbootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely\nsynchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not\nsupported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.\nThis does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.\nNotable changes\n===============\nThis is a minor release and hence there are no notable changes.\nFor the notable changes in 0.10, refer to the release notes for the\n0.10.0 release at\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.10.0/doc/release-notes.md\n0.10.1 Change log\n=================\nDetailed release notes follow.
