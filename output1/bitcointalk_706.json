Ensnared, Oliver lives with Karpeles and his gang of juvenile pickpockets in their lair for some time, unaware of their criminal occupations. He believes they make wallets, handkerchiefs and promote cryptocurrency.\nOliver realizes too late that their real mission is to pick pockets!\nOn the other hand, Oliverwho has an air of refinement proves to be of gentle birth. Although he has been abused and neglected all his life, he recoils, aghast, at the idea of victimising anyone else. This apparently hereditary gentlemanliness makes Oliver something of a changeling tale, not just an indictment of social injustice.
