This is great for the merchant, however there are some major drawbacks for the consumer:\n1) The bitcoin price might fluctuate between the time the consumer first bought the coins till the time they make the transaction, resulting in significant indirect transaction fees for the consumer.\n2) There is significant security risk, given that the bitcoins can be stolen from the online wallet of the consumer.\n3) Bitcoin is still hard understand for the average consumer. In most bitcoin wallets, if you lose your password you lose all your coins.\nSo, what has to happen is for bitpay and coinbase to provide a service that will automatically charge your bank account when you make an online purchase. You will be able to use dollars in your bank account to buy stuff online, only when the merchant will give you a 3% cash back, compared to the price you would have to pay if you were using a credit card. In that case, bitcoin is only used in the backend, the consumer doesn't know anything about it and they don't have to have a bitcoin wallet at all. At the same time, they get the benefit of cash back and the merchant gets the benefit of no fraud and no chargebacks.\n", "views": 988, "author": "Robin_Good Member Offline Activity: 148 Merit: 10 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat Bitpay and Coinbase need to do to increase bitcoin adoption in the US\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2014-09-28 16:34:10", "content": "Why use Bitcoin in that case?

So far I haven't heard of any real business that successfully works with BTC at the moment apart from exchange platforms and I wonder why?\ntheres over 100,000 businesses accepting bitcoin direct. and probably another 30k that are accepting it online and dont realise it (look at foodler for instance many restaurants dont realise that customers ordering their food through foodler, are bitcoin customers)\nbut anyway back to the 100k other businesses who do know about bitcoin. as others have already said there are big companies out there.\noverstock, dell, expedia, virgin galactic, to name just a few.\neven my business accepts bitcoin.\nGive the public one reason to use bitcoin when they go to say Overstock\nbuying bitcoins just to instantly spend IS NOT THE POINT. thats like asking an american to buy euro's to instantly spend on overstock simply because overstock accepts euro's...\nthe point of bitcoins is to hold for investment, to use if travelling. to hedge against FIAT inflation, to trade asier and cheaper compared to stocks/shares/forex. and here is the big one...\nto create new legitimate business.\nas long as a business registers with its tax office and sells legitimate goods and doesnt scam customers. thats all that should count. these days if a business wanted to start up, there is TOOO much red-tape. requiring setting up business bank accounts. having to show business plans and 5year plans to bank managers, just to open a proper business account. keeping receipts/bank statements for years.\nbut imagine being able to accept payments and having all your transactions logged without needing the bank account hurdles, without needing to keep paperwork, because its all dealt with by the blockchain. not to mention the cheaper tx fee's compared to credit card processors. and of course the investment potential. not having to worry about charge back scammers. etc etc\nI've seen a lot of crypto business fail a very bad sign.\nthose businesses were scammy businesses.. but a proper professional and legitimate business has better prospects\n", "author": "franky1 Legendary Online Activity: 2170 Merit: 1151 "}, {"date": "2014-09-30 08:44:34", "content": "Seeing Btc as an investment volatile as it is to me makes very few sense.
