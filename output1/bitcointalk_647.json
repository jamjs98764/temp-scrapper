Unfortunately, this means that data-center mining and full nodes may be inevitable too depending on hardware and network infrastructure performance over time. The centralization risk depends on the adoption curve, the degree that layer 2 networks remove transactions off-chain, and number of on-chain transactions that are attempted despite the presence of layer 2 systems.\nFailing to raise the transaction capacity centralizes the number of actors with access to the blockchain, recreating a financial system that presently exists.
