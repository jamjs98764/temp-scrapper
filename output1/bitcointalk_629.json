You can do it with paypal. Of course, get ready to get scammed with super high fees. I don't know the exact %'s but the fees are really high.\nThe Virxox fees are quite high, and complicated. There are fees for converting second life lindell dollars into BTC and back, fees for converting second life lindell dollars into fiat and back, and deposit fees. If you intend to leave your account unused for over 12 months leave your account empty because there is an inactivity fee of of 2 EUR per month until your account is empty.\nA copy of their fee structure is below.\nhttps://www.virwox.com/help.php#_Inactivity\nFees\nExchange Commissions and Discounts\nMarket Order:\nA small commission will be charged for the service of matching and executing your order against others. The commmission for market orders consists of a fixed fee plus a variable percentage, according to the following table:\nCurrency   Fixed   Variable\nEUR/SLL   50 SLL   2.90%\nUSD/SLL   50 SLL   2.90%\nGBP/SLL   50 SLL   2.90%\nCHF/SLL   50 SLL   2.90%\nEUR/ACD   50 ACD   3.90%\nUSD/ACD   50 ACD   3.90%\nSLL/ACD   25 ACD   3.90%\nSLL/OMC   25 OMC   1.90%\nEUR/OMC   50 OMC   2.90%\nUSD/OMC   50 OMC   1.90%\nBTC/SLL   50 SLL   2.90%\nEUR/MVC   50 MVC   2.90%\nNo discounts are applied for market orders, but the commission paid counts towards discounts for limit orders (see below).\nLimit Order:\nThe commission will only be charged if your order is actually executed. If executed partially, commission will only by paid on the part that has been executed. The base commission rate for all currently exchanged currencies is 3.9%. However, the more you exchange, the less you pay: The effective commission rate is determined by the base commission rate and your current discount on commission. The discount in turn is based on your trading activity (more precisely, the amount of SLL commission already paid) in the previous 30 days, according to the following table:\nCommission paid\n(last 30 days)   Discount   Effective\nCommission\n0 SLL   0%   3.90%\n1,000 SLL   10%   3.51%\n2,000 SLL   20%   3.12%\n5,000 SLL   30%   2.73%\n10,000 SLL   40%   2.34%\n20,000 SLL   50%   1.95%\n50,000 SLL   60%   1.56%\n100,000 SLL   70%   1.17%\n200,000 SLL   80%   0.78%\nPlease note that the discount rate applied to a specific order is the one that was in effect at the time when you have entered the order. If your discount rate changes after that time to your favour, you may of course cancel the order and re-enter it to take advantage of the higher discount level. Your current commission paid in the last 30 days and discount levels are displayed on the Account Overview page.\nDeposits\nPayPal: Unfortunately, PayPal charges us fees for its services, which are deducted from your deposit. Also, the fee varies with currency, location of customer, payment method used, transaction size, and the size of our previous transactions with PayPal; so the exact fee is only known to us after the transaction has taken place. As an example, the current fee for deposits in Euro for customers with their PayPal account kept in Euro is 0.35 Euro plus 3.4% of the transaction.\nCredit/Debit Cards, Skrill (Moneybookers): Similar to PayPal, Skrill charges us fees for its services, which are deducted from your deposit. The current fee for deposits in Euro for customers with their Skrill account kept in Euro is 0.39 Euro plus 3.5% of the transaction.\npaysafecard: The fee for paysafecard deposits is 20%.\nSOFORTbanking: For this service, SOFORT AG charges us a fee of 2.5% of the transaction value, with a minimum of 0.25 Euro (if the transaction value is below 10 Euros), which will be deducted from your deposit.\nOther Deposits: Other deposits (i.e. deposits of MVC from My Virtual Community) are free.\nWithdrawals\nSLL withdrawals to your Second Life account and ACD withdrawals to your Avination account are free of charge.\nA handling fee of 0.005 BTC per bitcoin withdrawal will be charged.\nA handling fee of 1 EUR (1 USD, 1 CHF, 1 GBP) + 2% PayPal Fee per PayPal withdrawal will be charged.\nA handling fee of 1 EUR (1 USD, 1 CHF, 1 GBP) per withdrawal will be charged for all other types of withdrawals (Skrill, Bank Transfers).\nSend virtual currency to other user\nSending virtual currency (SLL, ACD, or OMC) is free of charge.\nInactivity Fee\nThere is no fee just for maintaning your VirWoX account. However,\nif you have not used your VirWoX account for more than 12 months, we will charge an inactivity fee of 2 EUR\n(or the equivalent in other currency) per month, but only if there is a positive balance on the account.\n", "author": "belmonty Sr. Member Offline Activity: 294 Merit: 250 "}], "date": "2015-11-18 13:20:04"}, {"content": "So on the Science channel there is a commercial for a show called All American Makers and they mention bitcoin.

Thanks!\nDefinitely not trying to insult you nor anyone directly. I'd never insult someone asking questions. Anyhow let's compare Bitcoin to cash. Let's say we have 2 users that want to transact money. Person A gives person B 100$. In case that person B wants to be bad and ask for the payment again, person A can't prove that he has paid him. In comparison to this, we have the blockchain (a public, permanent ledger). These Bitcoins have to come from somewhere and have to go somewhere. One could argue that a mixer is helpful, but with a competent person and analysis they get beaten. There's also this problem of who is Person A behind address X? It comes down to the actual skill of that person. If they use some service (e.g. exchange like Coinbase), they could be caught easily (especially if the government is getting information).\nTl;dr: If you want to be 99% sure that one can't trace you, you have to convert to an anonymous coin e.g. Monero to \"clean\" your coins (one must also consider the sum, if you get xxx$ through elicit means, then don't convert everything at once from Monero to Bitcoin). This is why we call Bitcoin pseudo-anonymous (use Google for exact examples).\nI was expirienced this virus from hackers heres my link\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1250394.0\n-snip.\nNothing surprising.

He is an outstanding Bitcoin contributor, and he's had a positive influence on the creation of this BIP.\nThe 1 MB block size discussion has highlighted the inherent limitations to decentralized and heavily distributed blockchain technology; especially Bitcoin as it is implemented on a global scale. The heated debate has also highlighted the virtue of centralized systems; they are fast, cheap, scale easily, and very efficient. How do you compete with that? At Bitcoin's foundational layer, you simply don't. This realization has created a great reflection point for bitcoiners world wide. So then, what is Bitcoin's greatest value? Well, it provides a (financial) communication channel that is uncensored, transparent, global, available to all, robust, and incorruptible! What a priceless and precious tool; yet, it does come at a cost. The originators of Bitcoin had a mechanism for creating fair trade between those that use this invaluable service and those that provide it. It is called the Miner's Fee.\nThe fees go to the miners to incentivize them to keep mining, which in turn keeps the Bitcoin network secure. They already get a reward of 25 bitcoins for each block they mine, but this reward halves every 4 years. The plan is that as the block reward diminishes over time, it will be replaced by transaction fees. - bitcoinfees.com\nThe reality is this; the method for assessing a fair fee is underdeveloped. There are no tools of communication between users and miners nor between miners themselves for deriving an appropriate fee value. Regardless of the fee paid, the same quality of service has been rendered almost every time (with the exception of spam transactions). As we look at this upper limit on the block size, does it not cause one to ponder over the current fee system? Isn't a little competition to get processed into the block chain in a timely manner a good thing? Not that we shouldn't increase the upper cap, because we should, but it should be done while taking a serious look into the nonexistent fee market. And maybe, just maybe, while improving the fee system the best solution for removing the cap size altogether will come into everybody's view.\nSo, it all boils down to defining a healthy yet simplistic relationship between the fee value, confirmation time, and the block size. The truth is bitcoin miners already have control over this relationship. It's just waiting for them to embrace it. They can already pick and choose what transactions to include and exclude from the blocks. So, the idea presented below is not a complete solution to the current block size issue; however, it is definitely a step in the right direction as it empowers the miners vs. simply giving them a few choices. Plus, there is no hard (or soft) fork involved!\nBlock3 Inclusion\nThe cubic function can be a concise way of expressing a relationship between block size and fee price. It has 3 vital elements: number constant, linear slope, and exponential rise. The number constant can influence a stable fee value during low transaction volume. The linear portion determines a gradual increase in fee price as transaction volume gains which in turn demands larger block sizes. The exponential part can create a flexible wall of resistance as the block size approaches magnitudes that are not healthy for a decentralized/distributed network, yet theoretically, it wouldn't create a hard limit.\nY = aX3 + bX + c\nY\nis the minimum\nfee/kB\nratio for block inclusion\nX\nis the size of the block being mined\na, b, c\nare the parameters determined by the miner. The first two parameters,\na &amp; b\n, are always\npositive. Parameter\n'c'\ncan be positive or negative.\nNow, on to implementation. It all starts with each miner determining the cubic function parameters a, b, and c that best express their perceived value of Bitcoin as a service. Then the following code will determine which transactions are included.\nPseudo Code:\nOrder all non-confirmed transactions by their\nfee/kB\nratio into a list.\nReset block size\nX\nto 0.\nGet first transaction on the list;\nY\n= transactions'\nfee/kB\nratio\nWhile the following is true\nY &gt; (aX3 + bX + c )\nInclude transaction into block\nUpdate the block size\nX\nGet next transaction on the list;\nY\n= transactions'\nfee/kB\nratio\nExample:\nHere's a feel good example with the following parameters for the cubic formula:\na = 3 x 10-12   b = 1.5 x 10-6        c = 3 x 10-4\nThe parameters that define this graph indicate that if the transaction volume can be satisfied with block sizes of 200 kB or less, then all transactions are included even those with no transactions fee. with block size demands between 200 kB and 600 kB there is a gradual almost linear increase, but afterward, the curvature of the parabola starts to kick in increasing the fees dramatically. Note, the parameters that the miners choose for this formula are dynamic; they can be adjusted often to accommodate external factors. What is really exciting about all this is that it adds meaning to the transaction fee. Before, it was more of an anti spam mechanism and a miner tipping service, but now, the fee can correlate with speed/quality of service.\nIt's a'block Time\nThe following graph gives a good visual representation of the price for blockchain participation (speed vs. fee/kB). Notice that on the fee/kB axis, it is not quantified, for that is also a function of transaction volume or demand from the users. It will be updating continuously throughout each day.\nThe varying fee sizes per kB have been divided into several categories with descriptions of anticipated service quality. Again, this graph and these categories are more to convey a vision of how the fee market could develop into something healthy. The end result will more likely be some variation of what is understood here.\nFee Size:         Speed (Service Quality)\nCheapskate:\nMay never make it into the blockchain.\nCheap:\nCould take a while. Small risk of indefinite exclusion.\nEconomy:\nTime doesn't matter. Processed during low volume. Good value.\nSlow:\nWithin one hour.\nFast:\nWithin ½ hour.\nExpedite:\nNext block.\nLove those Miners:\nNext block. Showing some appreciation to the miners.\nJust a miner Communication Detail\nThe parameters selected for determining fees should be broadcast with each block solved. Every miner is going to have different and varying parameters and it is essential that they be communicated to the customer base for a robust fee market. How? What's the preferred way? The parameter data could be included in the block itself or the block could simply contain a hash of that data where it is then broadcast later and maybe through different channels if so desired. As each miner states their voice using the hashing power they control, bitcoin users will have a solid understanding of the fair trade value to communicate on the blockchain.\nFee Sharing\nA powerful gesture of collaboration\nThe article 'Devastating' protocol flaw could paralyze Bitcoin system written by Dan Goodin stated the following:\nAs the currency grows into [full] maturity the verification of other transactions will be Bitcoin's sole reward scheme. And therein lies the flaw that could represent a chief stumbling block.\nWith each participant rewarded only for verifying a proposed transaction, there will be little incentive for participants to broadcast transactions to others. Instead, they will want to keep the deals secret so they don't have to share the rewards with others.\nThere is a nugget of truth from this article and the problem it highlights is echoed in the attempt to establish a relationship between block size, fee price, and quality of service. What miner in their right mind is going to limit the amount of transactions that are included in their block when money is on the line? The bitcoin mining network is not a homogeneous community, yet everyone has a vested interest in its overall success. What can be done?\nThere is only one solution to this! Short of a fork, I would be willing to share all the collected fees in a block with the coinbase addresses of the last 100 blocks. Are you up for doing the same? This would create a movement to reduce incentive for selfish mining. If enough miners join the movement to solidify a more homogenous community then that would be a powerful statement to all bitcoin developers scrambling for a non-existent bullet proof solution to the block size issue. In the end, there has to be a little bit of trust that enough miners want to do the right thing. Later, it could become protocol in the next update.\nArtificially Decreasing the Block Size\nPathway to NO Block limit\nHere's a novel suggestion. While we the miners demonstrate commitment to the overall success of the bitcoin/blockchain service, why not also demonstrate restraint in block size growth. For example, if enough miners select parameters that create exponential fee resistance around 0.5 MB block size, it wouldn't create a hard limit yet it would communicate confidence to the development community and the world that the block size growth issue is going to be handled just fine. Yes, this would contribute temporarily to higher fees, but is it not worth it to jump start the fee market and get this critical issue solved in a meaningful way?\nSo, is there a Fork?\nIn this BIP, there was no demand for a Fork, not even a soft one. But rather, information was presented to inspire the creation of tools that would empower the miners with the ability to fully express themselves in how to deliver their service. Tools that would open communication between miners and between miners and bitcoin users. Information to provoke thought and perception of the block size issue from a new angle. Ideas to invigorate a more homogenous mining community. As mentioned before, this is not The Solution, but rather a potentially positive step in the right direction. In my personal opinion, it is a necessary step before the proper resolution can be found to the block size issue.\nSo far, the majority of the solutions out there appear to default to a small increase in the block size limit now while working on a better solution in the future. If it comes to this, I'm personally in favor of a modest increase to 2MB.\nA big thank you to all persons contributing and engaging the community in a positive manner.\nSlim's Bitcoin (\nwww.SlimsBTC.info\n)\nInfluential Leadership to Empower a New World\n", "views": 675, "author": "allten Sr. Member Offline Activity: 450 Merit: 250 You Don't Bitcoin 'till You Mint Coin ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo Fee or Not to Fee: A Fresh Look at Bitcoin's Block Size\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-11-17 23:20:45", "content": "Where was the discussion of this on the development mailing list, or the number assigned?\n(If it had been, I'm sure many competent people would have pointed out how broken it is.)\n", "author": "Luke-Jr Legendary Offline Activity: 2422 Merit: 1011 "}, {"date": "2015-11-17 23:26:09", "content": "This is a pretty interesting post.

If you have not contributed actual code to a bitcoin-implementation, this is probably not the place you want to reach out to. There are many places to discuss things that the developers read, including this forum.\nlink to this week logs\nMeeting minutes by meetbot\nMain topics discussed where:\ntransaction priority for 0.12\nOpt-in replace-by-fee\nVersionbits\nChain limits\ntransaction priority for 0.12\n- background\nEach transaction is assigned a priority, determined by the age, size, and number of inputs. Which currently makes some transactions free.\nThis currently has a large amount of code, which makes it harder to maintain, and is not that optimal since you can't expect miners to include 0-fee transactions.\n- meeting comments\nMost people seem fine with removing priority in the mempool, but people should be notified ahead of time this is coming.\nsdaftuar proposed a staggered approach, setting the default value for priority to 0, and remove it entirely in the next release.\npetertodd notes there will be a natural staggered process since not everyone will upgrade to 0.12 instantly and some implementations might not remove priority at all.\nMost wallet-software outside of bitcoin-core don't implement priority calculations.\nAs fee estimation becomes more important and many wallet providers use the bitcoin-core fee estimation, improvements on that are welcome.\nLuke-Jr doesn't agree with removing priority, particularly with changing the mining code to use the priority a transaction has when it enters the mempool.\nSipa has the idea to add a small fraction of bitcoin days destroyed divided by the average\nUTXO\nage to the fee, so that non-spam-attack transactions are viewed as if they have a larger fee.\nWhile most agree with the proposal to remove the current priority, there's still much debate on whether it needs to be replaced for 0.13, and if so, how.\n- meeting conclusion\nReview \"\nImprove usage of fee estimation code\n\"\nBlueMatt will mail the developer mailinglist announcing the changes. (\nhttps://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org/msg02790.html\n)\nOpt-in replace-by-fee\n- background\nCurrently when a node sees a transaction that spends the same output it ignores it. With replace-by-fee it replaces the current transaction in the mempool if it has a higher fee.\nThis allows for things like spending \"stuck\" transactions, adding more recipients to a transaction in order to prevent chaining, etc.\nSince there are people that accept 0-confirmation transactions and this would make it extremely easy to double spend them, this is made opt-in.\nThe sender can choose to opt-in to replace-by-fee by changing an input in the nSequence field.\n- meeting comments\nPeter Todd wrote some tools to use replace-by-fee.\nlink\nIt would be nice to have opt-in per output instead of the whole transaction, however that would be very hard to implement and would have some privacy concerns.\nLuke-Jr would like to see an option to toggle between first-seen-safe/full RBF and never/opt-in/always. Since there are possibly some objections with the \"always\" toggle it should be a separate pull-request.\n- meeting conclusion\nreview and merge\nnSequence-based Full-RBF opt-in\nPeter Todd will write a mail to the list to explain how it works and how people can not accept opt-in transactions.\nVersionbits\n- background\nBIP 9\nCurrently softforks have been done by the isSuperMajority mechanism, meaning when 95% of the last X blocks has a version number higher than Y the fork is deployed.\nA new way of doing this is currently being worked on and that uses all bits of the version number, appropriately being called versionbits. So instead of a fork happening when the version is larger than (for example) 00000000011 (3), a fork happens when (for example) the 3rd bit is up (so 00100000011).\nThis way softforks can be deployed simultaneous and independent of each other.\n- meeting comments\nThere are 2 different implementations. One from\nCodeshark\nand one from\nRusty\njtimon thinks both implementations are more complicated than they need to be.\nThere needs to be a minor revision namely a starting time for proposals.\nIn general we'd like to get this in soon, but existing softforks need to complete first.\n- meeting conclusion\nCodeShark adds a starting time to versionbits.\nChain limits\n- background\nChain in this context means connected transactions. When you send a transaction that depends on another transaction that has yet to be confirmed we talk about a chain of transactions.\nMiners ideally take the whole chain into account instead of just every single transaction (although that's not widely implemented afaik). So while a single transaction might not have a sufficient fee, a depending transaction could have a high enough fee to make it worthwhile to mine both.\nThis is commonly known as child-pays-for-parent.\nSince you can make these chains very big it's possible to clog up the mempool this way.\nWith the recent malleability attacks, anyone who made transactions going multiple layers deep would've already encountered huge problems doing this (beautifully explained in\nlet's talk bitcoin #258\nfrom 13:50 onwards)\nProposal\nand\ngithub\nlink.\n- meeting comments\nWumpus doesn't feel comfortable with merging it because there's some controversy from companies who exceed the limits (or could be/want to).\njgarzik does feel comfortable with it, and many think it should be merged as it's easy to revert if needed.\nThere's little choice as it's not safe from attacks without limits.\nWe should communicate the replace-by-fee sendmany alternative to long chains (adding new recipients on existing non-confirmed transactions), although it won't show up in users wallet yet and block-explorers probably aren't ready to display it correctly.\nEmphasis on the fact it's a change in default values, not a consensus change, however default values have a lot of power.\nThe final limits are 25 transactions and 101kb total size for both ancestor and descendant packages.\n- meeting conclusion\njgarzik will merge the pull-request.\nMorcos will mail the list once it's merged.\nParticipants\nCode:\nBlueMatt    Matt Corallo\npetertodd   Peter Todd\nmorcos      Alex Morcos\njgarzik     Jeff Garzik\ngmaxwell    Gregory Maxwell\nwumpus      Wladimir J. van der Laan\nLuke-Jr     Luke Dashjr\njtimon      Jorge Timón\nbtcdrak     btcdrak\nphantomcircuit  Patrick Strateman\nsipa        Pieter Wuille\nCodeShark   Eric Lombrozo\nsdaftuar    Suhas Daftuar\njg_taxi     jg_taxi\ngavinandresen  Gavin Andresen\ncfields     Cory Fields\nbsm1175321  Bob McElrath\nComic relief\nCode:\n19:53\nsipa\nnew topic?\n19:53\nwumpus\nany other topics?\n19:53\npetertodd\n&lt;crickets&gt;\n19:53\njgarzik\ndid we cover jonas while I was in the taxi?\n19:54\nsdaftuar\n?\n19:54\njtimon\n?\n19:54\nCodeShark\nnot sure I want to know\n19:54\njgarzik\nproposal for new GUI maintainer\n19:54\nCodeShark\nsounds kinky, though\n19:54\npetertodd\nCodeShark: GUI's are pretty kinky\n19:56\nBlueMatt\nok, end meeting?\n19:56\nbtcdrak\nif we can remember the command this week :-)\n19:56\nwumpus\n#meetingend\n19:56\ngmaxwell\n#destroymeeting\n19:56\nwumpus\n#endmeeting\n19:56\nLuke-Jr\n#endmeeting\n19:56\nlightningbot\nMeeting ended Thu Nov 12 19:56:42 2015 UTC.

Since only high ranking members of the FBI have the power and authority over this type of information, the information on the two agents convinced Jones to believe that Diamond is an FBI official.\nHe continued:\nI wasn't taking him serious in the beginning, and even once I realized he was who he said, and he was amassing millions of dollars in ill gotten gains, it wasn't until he started obsessing on the kidnappings, that I realized I had a lunatic on my hands.

If you ignore the murder for hire allegations against Ross, then what he/SR1 did was really not all that bad.....he allowed people to make additional informed choices about what to put in their bodies, and he caused drug related violence to decrease as a result of SR1. If you take the above facts and the crimes that Ross was charged with in NY, then I think it would be fair to say that what Ross did was really not all that bad and should probably not be in jail/prison. It would be fairly easy to say that Ross would be deserving of a pardon.\nHowever if there is any substance to the allegation that Ross ordered the murder of 5 people, 3 of which were most likely innocent (I do not know with certainty one way or another if there is substance behind this allegation), then it is much more difficult to argue that Ross should be a free man, and that what he did was not bad. It if very difficult to argue that someone who (there is substantial evidence that) has ordered the killing of others should be released from prison.

If you ignore the murder for hire allegations against Ross, then what he/SR1 did was really not all that bad.....he allowed people to make additional informed choices about what to put in their bodies, and he caused drug related violence to decrease as a result of SR1. If you take the above facts and the crimes that Ross was charged with in NY, then I think it would be fair to say that what Ross did was really not all that bad and should probably not be in jail/prison. It would be fairly easy to say that Ross would be deserving of a pardon.\nHowever if there is any substance to the allegation that Ross ordered the murder of 5 people, 3 of which were most likely innocent (I do not know with certainty one way or another if there is substance behind this allegation), then it is much more difficult to argue that Ross should be a free man, and that what he did was not bad. It if very difficult to argue that someone who (there is substantial evidence that) has ordered the killing of others should be released from prison. I acknowledge that Ross may have been manipulated into making this decision by potentially Law Enforcement Officers who were attempting to personally profit, however this kind of behavior is nearly impossible to excuse.\nI'm the one that exposed Curtis Green as a serial liar, and he hasn't been back to this forum since:\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1045937.0\nIronically, Leroy Fodor is gleaning passages from this thread pertaining to a blog administered by Joshua Zipkin in trying to curtail my investigation into Cryptsy.

Since only high ranking members of the FBI have the power and authority over this type of information, the information on the two agents convinced Jones to believe that Diamond is an FBI official.\nHe continued:\nI wasn't taking him serious in the beginning, and even once I realized he was who he said, and he was amassing millions of dollars in ill gotten gains, it wasn't until he started obsessing on the kidnappings, that I realized I had a lunatic on my hands.

Thanks!\nDefinitely not trying to insult you nor anyone directly. I'd never insult someone asking questions. Anyhow let's compare Bitcoin to cash. Let's say we have 2 users that want to transact money. Person A gives person B 100$. In case that person B wants to be bad and ask for the payment again, person A can't prove that he has paid him. In comparison to this, we have the blockchain (a public, permanent ledger). These Bitcoins have to come from somewhere and have to go somewhere. One could argue that a mixer is helpful, but with a competent person and analysis they get beaten. There's also this problem of who is Person A behind address X? It comes down to the actual skill of that person. If they use some service (e.g. exchange like Coinbase), they could be caught easily (especially if the government is getting information).\nTl;dr: If you want to be 99% sure that one can't trace you, you have to convert to an anonymous coin e.g. Monero to \"clean\" your coins (one must also consider the sum, if you get xxx$ through elicit means, then don't convert everything at once from Monero to Bitcoin). This is why we call Bitcoin pseudo-anonymous (use Google for exact examples).\nI was expirienced this virus from hackers heres my link\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1250394.0\n-snip.\nNothing surprising.

He is an outstanding Bitcoin contributor, and he's had a positive influence on the creation of this BIP.\nThe 1 MB block size discussion has highlighted the inherent limitations to decentralized and heavily distributed blockchain technology; especially Bitcoin as it is implemented on a global scale. The heated debate has also highlighted the virtue of centralized systems; they are fast, cheap, scale easily, and very efficient. How do you compete with that? At Bitcoin's foundational layer, you simply don't. This realization has created a great reflection point for bitcoiners world wide. So then, what is Bitcoin's greatest value? Well, it provides a (financial) communication channel that is uncensored, transparent, global, available to all, robust, and incorruptible! What a priceless and precious tool; yet, it does come at a cost. The originators of Bitcoin had a mechanism for creating fair trade between those that use this invaluable service and those that provide it. It is called the Miner's Fee.\nThe fees go to the miners to incentivize them to keep mining, which in turn keeps the Bitcoin network secure. They already get a reward of 25 bitcoins for each block they mine, but this reward halves every 4 years. The plan is that as the block reward diminishes over time, it will be replaced by transaction fees. - bitcoinfees.com\nThe reality is this; the method for assessing a fair fee is underdeveloped. There are no tools of communication between users and miners nor between miners themselves for deriving an appropriate fee value. Regardless of the fee paid, the same quality of service has been rendered almost every time (with the exception of spam transactions). As we look at this upper limit on the block size, does it not cause one to ponder over the current fee system? Isn't a little competition to get processed into the block chain in a timely manner a good thing? Not that we shouldn't increase the upper cap, because we should, but it should be done while taking a serious look into the nonexistent fee market. And maybe, just maybe, while improving the fee system the best solution for removing the cap size altogether will come into everybody's view.\nSo, it all boils down to defining a healthy yet simplistic relationship between the fee value, confirmation time, and the block size. The truth is bitcoin miners already have control over this relationship. It's just waiting for them to embrace it. They can already pick and choose what transactions to include and exclude from the blocks. So, the idea presented below is not a complete solution to the current block size issue; however, it is definitely a step in the right direction as it empowers the miners vs. simply giving them a few choices. Plus, there is no hard (or soft) fork involved!\nBlock3 Inclusion\nThe cubic function can be a concise way of expressing a relationship between block size and fee price. It has 3 vital elements: number constant, linear slope, and exponential rise. The number constant can influence a stable fee value during low transaction volume. The linear portion determines a gradual increase in fee price as transaction volume gains which in turn demands larger block sizes. The exponential part can create a flexible wall of resistance as the block size approaches magnitudes that are not healthy for a decentralized/distributed network, yet theoretically, it wouldn't create a hard limit.\nY = aX3 + bX + c\nY\nis the minimum\nfee/kB\nratio for block inclusion\nX\nis the size of the block being mined\na, b, c\nare the parameters determined by the miner. The first two parameters,\na &amp; b\n, are always\npositive. Parameter\n'c'\ncan be positive or negative.\nNow, on to implementation. It all starts with each miner determining the cubic function parameters a, b, and c that best express their perceived value of Bitcoin as a service. Then the following code will determine which transactions are included.\nPseudo Code:\nOrder all non-confirmed transactions by their\nfee/kB\nratio into a list.\nReset block size\nX\nto 0.\nGet first transaction on the list;\nY\n= transactions'\nfee/kB\nratio\nWhile the following is true\nY &gt; (aX3 + bX + c )\nInclude transaction into block\nUpdate the block size\nX\nGet next transaction on the list;\nY\n= transactions'\nfee/kB\nratio\nExample:\nHere's a feel good example with the following parameters for the cubic formula:\na = 3 x 10-12   b = 1.5 x 10-6        c = 3 x 10-4\nThe parameters that define this graph indicate that if the transaction volume can be satisfied with block sizes of 200 kB or less, then all transactions are included even those with no transactions fee. with block size demands between 200 kB and 600 kB there is a gradual almost linear increase, but afterward, the curvature of the parabola starts to kick in increasing the fees dramatically. Note, the parameters that the miners choose for this formula are dynamic; they can be adjusted often to accommodate external factors. What is really exciting about all this is that it adds meaning to the transaction fee. Before, it was more of an anti spam mechanism and a miner tipping service, but now, the fee can correlate with speed/quality of service.\nIt's a'block Time\nThe following graph gives a good visual representation of the price for blockchain participation (speed vs. fee/kB). Notice that on the fee/kB axis, it is not quantified, for that is also a function of transaction volume or demand from the users. It will be updating continuously throughout each day.\nThe varying fee sizes per kB have been divided into several categories with descriptions of anticipated service quality. Again, this graph and these categories are more to convey a vision of how the fee market could develop into something healthy. The end result will more likely be some variation of what is understood here.\nFee Size:         Speed (Service Quality)\nCheapskate:\nMay never make it into the blockchain.\nCheap:\nCould take a while. Small risk of indefinite exclusion.\nEconomy:\nTime doesn't matter. Processed during low volume. Good value.\nSlow:\nWithin one hour.\nFast:\nWithin ½ hour.\nExpedite:\nNext block.\nLove those Miners:\nNext block. Showing some appreciation to the miners.\nJust a miner Communication Detail\nThe parameters selected for determining fees should be broadcast with each block solved. Every miner is going to have different and varying parameters and it is essential that they be communicated to the customer base for a robust fee market. How? What's the preferred way? The parameter data could be included in the block itself or the block could simply contain a hash of that data where it is then broadcast later and maybe through different channels if so desired. As each miner states their voice using the hashing power they control, bitcoin users will have a solid understanding of the fair trade value to communicate on the blockchain.\nFee Sharing\nA powerful gesture of collaboration\nThe article 'Devastating' protocol flaw could paralyze Bitcoin system written by Dan Goodin stated the following:\nAs the currency grows into [full] maturity the verification of other transactions will be Bitcoin's sole reward scheme. And therein lies the flaw that could represent a chief stumbling block.\nWith each participant rewarded only for verifying a proposed transaction, there will be little incentive for participants to broadcast transactions to others. Instead, they will want to keep the deals secret so they don't have to share the rewards with others.\nThere is a nugget of truth from this article and the problem it highlights is echoed in the attempt to establish a relationship between block size, fee price, and quality of service. What miner in their right mind is going to limit the amount of transactions that are included in their block when money is on the line? The bitcoin mining network is not a homogeneous community, yet everyone has a vested interest in its overall success. What can be done?\nThere is only one solution to this! Short of a fork, I would be willing to share all the collected fees in a block with the coinbase addresses of the last 100 blocks. Are you up for doing the same? This would create a movement to reduce incentive for selfish mining. If enough miners join the movement to solidify a more homogenous community then that would be a powerful statement to all bitcoin developers scrambling for a non-existent bullet proof solution to the block size issue. In the end, there has to be a little bit of trust that enough miners want to do the right thing. Later, it could become protocol in the next update.\nArtificially Decreasing the Block Size\nPathway to NO Block limit\nHere's a novel suggestion. While we the miners demonstrate commitment to the overall success of the bitcoin/blockchain service, why not also demonstrate restraint in block size growth. For example, if enough miners select parameters that create exponential fee resistance around 0.5 MB block size, it wouldn't create a hard limit yet it would communicate confidence to the development community and the world that the block size growth issue is going to be handled just fine. Yes, this would contribute temporarily to higher fees, but is it not worth it to jump start the fee market and get this critical issue solved in a meaningful way?\nSo, is there a Fork?\nIn this BIP, there was no demand for a Fork, not even a soft one. But rather, information was presented to inspire the creation of tools that would empower the miners with the ability to fully express themselves in how to deliver their service. Tools that would open communication between miners and between miners and bitcoin users. Information to provoke thought and perception of the block size issue from a new angle. Ideas to invigorate a more homogenous mining community. As mentioned before, this is not The Solution, but rather a potentially positive step in the right direction. In my personal opinion, it is a necessary step before the proper resolution can be found to the block size issue.\nSo far, the majority of the solutions out there appear to default to a small increase in the block size limit now while working on a better solution in the future. If it comes to this, I'm personally in favor of a modest increase to 2MB.\nA big thank you to all persons contributing and engaging the community in a positive manner.\nSlim's Bitcoin (\nwww.SlimsBTC.info\n)\nInfluential Leadership to Empower a New World\n", "views": 675, "author": "allten Sr. Member Offline Activity: 450 Merit: 250 You Don't Bitcoin 'till You Mint Coin ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo Fee or Not to Fee: A Fresh Look at Bitcoin's Block Size\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t", "replies": [{"date": "2015-11-17 23:20:45", "content": "Where was the discussion of this on the development mailing list, or the number assigned?\n(If it had been, I'm sure many competent people would have pointed out how broken it is.)\n", "author": "Luke-Jr Legendary Offline Activity: 2422 Merit: 1011 "}, {"date": "2015-11-17 23:26:09", "content": "This is a pretty interesting post.

If you have not contributed actual code to a bitcoin-implementation, this is probably not the place you want to reach out to. There are many places to discuss things that the developers read, including this forum.\nlink to this week logs\nMeeting minutes by meetbot\nMain topics discussed where:\ntransaction priority for 0.12\nOpt-in replace-by-fee\nVersionbits\nChain limits\ntransaction priority for 0.12\n- background\nEach transaction is assigned a priority, determined by the age, size, and number of inputs. Which currently makes some transactions free.\nThis currently has a large amount of code, which makes it harder to maintain, and is not that optimal since you can't expect miners to include 0-fee transactions.\n- meeting comments\nMost people seem fine with removing priority in the mempool, but people should be notified ahead of time this is coming.\nsdaftuar proposed a staggered approach, setting the default value for priority to 0, and remove it entirely in the next release.\npetertodd notes there will be a natural staggered process since not everyone will upgrade to 0.12 instantly and some implementations might not remove priority at all.\nMost wallet-software outside of bitcoin-core don't implement priority calculations.\nAs fee estimation becomes more important and many wallet providers use the bitcoin-core fee estimation, improvements on that are welcome.\nLuke-Jr doesn't agree with removing priority, particularly with changing the mining code to use the priority a transaction has when it enters the mempool.\nSipa has the idea to add a small fraction of bitcoin days destroyed divided by the average\nUTXO\nage to the fee, so that non-spam-attack transactions are viewed as if they have a larger fee.\nWhile most agree with the proposal to remove the current priority, there's still much debate on whether it needs to be replaced for 0.13, and if so, how.\n- meeting conclusion\nReview \"\nImprove usage of fee estimation code\n\"\nBlueMatt will mail the developer mailinglist announcing the changes. (\nhttps://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org/msg02790.html\n)\nOpt-in replace-by-fee\n- background\nCurrently when a node sees a transaction that spends the same output it ignores it. With replace-by-fee it replaces the current transaction in the mempool if it has a higher fee.\nThis allows for things like spending \"stuck\" transactions, adding more recipients to a transaction in order to prevent chaining, etc.\nSince there are people that accept 0-confirmation transactions and this would make it extremely easy to double spend them, this is made opt-in.\nThe sender can choose to opt-in to replace-by-fee by changing an input in the nSequence field.\n- meeting comments\nPeter Todd wrote some tools to use replace-by-fee.\nlink\nIt would be nice to have opt-in per output instead of the whole transaction, however that would be very hard to implement and would have some privacy concerns.\nLuke-Jr would like to see an option to toggle between first-seen-safe/full RBF and never/opt-in/always. Since there are possibly some objections with the \"always\" toggle it should be a separate pull-request.\n- meeting conclusion\nreview and merge\nnSequence-based Full-RBF opt-in\nPeter Todd will write a mail to the list to explain how it works and how people can not accept opt-in transactions.\nVersionbits\n- background\nBIP 9\nCurrently softforks have been done by the isSuperMajority mechanism, meaning when 95% of the last X blocks has a version number higher than Y the fork is deployed.\nA new way of doing this is currently being worked on and that uses all bits of the version number, appropriately being called versionbits. So instead of a fork happening when the version is larger than (for example) 00000000011 (3), a fork happens when (for example) the 3rd bit is up (so 00100000011).\nThis way softforks can be deployed simultaneous and independent of each other.\n- meeting comments\nThere are 2 different implementations. One from\nCodeshark\nand one from\nRusty\njtimon thinks both implementations are more complicated than they need to be.\nThere needs to be a minor revision namely a starting time for proposals.\nIn general we'd like to get this in soon, but existing softforks need to complete first.\n- meeting conclusion\nCodeShark adds a starting time to versionbits.\nChain limits\n- background\nChain in this context means connected transactions. When you send a transaction that depends on another transaction that has yet to be confirmed we talk about a chain of transactions.\nMiners ideally take the whole chain into account instead of just every single transaction (although that's not widely implemented afaik). So while a single transaction might not have a sufficient fee, a depending transaction could have a high enough fee to make it worthwhile to mine both.\nThis is commonly known as child-pays-for-parent.\nSince you can make these chains very big it's possible to clog up the mempool this way.\nWith the recent malleability attacks, anyone who made transactions going multiple layers deep would've already encountered huge problems doing this (beautifully explained in\nlet's talk bitcoin #258\nfrom 13:50 onwards)\nProposal\nand\ngithub\nlink.\n- meeting comments\nWumpus doesn't feel comfortable with merging it because there's some controversy from companies who exceed the limits (or could be/want to).\njgarzik does feel comfortable with it, and many think it should be merged as it's easy to revert if needed.\nThere's little choice as it's not safe from attacks without limits.\nWe should communicate the replace-by-fee sendmany alternative to long chains (adding new recipients on existing non-confirmed transactions), although it won't show up in users wallet yet and block-explorers probably aren't ready to display it correctly.\nEmphasis on the fact it's a change in default values, not a consensus change, however default values have a lot of power.\nThe final limits are 25 transactions and 101kb total size for both ancestor and descendant packages.\n- meeting conclusion\njgarzik will merge the pull-request.\nMorcos will mail the list once it's merged.\nParticipants\nCode:\nBlueMatt    Matt Corallo\npetertodd   Peter Todd\nmorcos      Alex Morcos\njgarzik     Jeff Garzik\ngmaxwell    Gregory Maxwell\nwumpus      Wladimir J. van der Laan\nLuke-Jr     Luke Dashjr\njtimon      Jorge Timón\nbtcdrak     btcdrak\nphantomcircuit  Patrick Strateman\nsipa        Pieter Wuille\nCodeShark   Eric Lombrozo\nsdaftuar    Suhas Daftuar\njg_taxi     jg_taxi\ngavinandresen  Gavin Andresen\ncfields     Cory Fields\nbsm1175321  Bob McElrath\nComic relief\nCode:\n19:53\nsipa\nnew topic?\n19:53\nwumpus\nany other topics?\n19:53\npetertodd\n&lt;crickets&gt;\n19:53\njgarzik\ndid we cover jonas while I was in the taxi?\n19:54\nsdaftuar\n?\n19:54\njtimon\n?\n19:54\nCodeShark\nnot sure I want to know\n19:54\njgarzik\nproposal for new GUI maintainer\n19:54\nCodeShark\nsounds kinky, though\n19:54\npetertodd\nCodeShark: GUI's are pretty kinky\n19:56\nBlueMatt\nok, end meeting?\n19:56\nbtcdrak\nif we can remember the command this week :-)\n19:56\nwumpus\n#meetingend\n19:56\ngmaxwell\n#destroymeeting\n19:56\nwumpus\n#endmeeting\n19:56\nLuke-Jr\n#endmeeting\n19:56\nlightningbot\nMeeting ended Thu Nov 12 19:56:42 2015 UTC.

Since only high ranking members of the FBI have the power and authority over this type of information, the information on the two agents convinced Jones to believe that Diamond is an FBI official.\nHe continued:\nI wasn't taking him serious in the beginning, and even once I realized he was who he said, and he was amassing millions of dollars in ill gotten gains, it wasn't until he started obsessing on the kidnappings, that I realized I had a lunatic on my hands. A lunatic highly placed in the FBI, with a massive off the books private budget, who thought that kidnapping and torture were the solution to his problems, and he starting to get a few other screws loose, as well.

Since only high ranking members of the FBI have the power and authority over this type of information, the information on the two agents convinced Jones to believe that Diamond is an FBI official.\nHe continued:\nI wasn't taking him serious in the beginning, and even once I realized he was who he said, and he was amassing millions of dollars in ill gotten gains, it wasn't until he started obsessing on the kidnappings, that I realized I had a lunatic on my hands.

Antonopoulos. I've been involved in bitcoin for 4 years, 3 of those as my full-time and only occupation.\nI'm a computer scientist with a Master's degree in Data Communications and have been coding since I was 11. For two decades I was a freelance security consultant, system administrator, IT manager and developer in a wide variety of roles. I've spent a lot of time working in the data centers of financial services companies.\nOnce I discovered bitcoin and realized the power of this technology, I switched my focus entirely to bitcoin. I've written a technical book \"Mastering Bitcoin\" which is published by O'Reilly Media and also available as an open source title. The book is currently being translated into more than 30 languages and can be read for free in 5 languages.\nYou can buy the book from Amazon here:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Unlocking-Digital-Cryptocurrencies/dp/1449374042\nThe source code for the book is here:\nhttps://github.com/aantonop/bitcoinbook\nI spend most of my time speaking at conferences, community meetups and doing interviews with both mainstream and independent media. You can find a collection of my videos here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPQwGV1aLnTthcG265_FYSaV24hFScvC0\nI'm also the CTO of Third Key Solutions that specializes in multi-signature solutions for companies.\n", "views": 1199, "author": "MemoryDealers VIP Legendary Offline Activity: 1034 Merit: 1050 ", "topic": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndreas M.
