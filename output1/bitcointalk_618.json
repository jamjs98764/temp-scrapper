Don't start investigating every potential way to score easy bitcoin because this is what leads to unhealthy greed and consequentially, to bad decisions. Don't trade, mine, gamble, just keep it honest and if you have a long range, positive outlook for bitcoin then everything will fall into play in due time. However, since the price of coins is on the rise, every .1 that you can grab for yourself and save will be a plus for you down the road. That's why trading the unknown is troublesome, unless you already have a stash and you're just playing w/ loot from your checking account.\nIn essence, getting into bitcoin leads one to read as much as possible about the whole ecosystem and the wanting to grab more coinage in any way possible w/o understanding and/or respecting the risks. At some point, those that haven't saved up and are chomping at the bit to get more coinage are desperate to try less trusted means of acquiring and the result could end in the same way as the OP. The sad thing is none of this will change as each subsequent subset of people will learn about and get into bitcoin at different price ranges and then will have undergone different seasons in the bitcoin world which will have tested their nerves in different ways but if one can keep on buying more coins and saving them w/o the urge to gamble, they'll be fine as the coin matures into what they assumed it was going to be once they decided to buy in in the first place. Most of us have made mistakes because of the learning curve and if I could do it over again (which I don't wish to), I would've just saved every last coin I ever bought.\n", "author": "Chef Ramsay Legendary Offline Activity: 1568 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-12-19 19:16:26", "content": "A sad story, but you can't blame bitcoin for what happened to you.

It's not in human nature to be greedy, it's just you as a person who is greedy to keep wanting more and more. Not everyone has greed in them. Some people are pretty satisfied with the things that mother nature gave them, they don't need certain stuff to live their lives like something like money.

Until April 2015 when my miners that I used for solo mining actually found a block.\nIt was my first time finding one after over a year of trying and seeing 25 coins in my wallet worth almost $6,000.00 was so exhilarating and I felt like I was on cloud 9\nI told my fiance about it and for the first time she was happy i had gotten involved into mining bitcoin.\nI made a promise never to touch them until we we ready to retire.\nA few days later I purchased 1 bitcoin and rented some hashpower and tried my luck at solo mining again.\nBefore I had spent even 1/4 of that bitcoin I found another block.\nWoo hoo! This is easy I told myself.\nOf course I told her about it and again she was very pleased.\nThis time I promised I would only use five coins to try and solo mine another block.\nWell I lost the five.\nThen more, then more and more and more until I had lost it all.\nI couldn't tell her what I had done, couldn't admit that I had turned into a compulsive gambler and threw it all away.\nSo what did I decide to do?\nI took out a home equity loan and borrowed $30,000.00 so I could purchase about 75 coins at the time.\nI just knewI had figured out a system and with that many coins I would be able to get back what I had lost and repay my home equity loan.\nSo from April 2015 until mid December 2015 I tried every method I could come up with to try and outsmart the system.\nAt times I would spend an average of 1 bitcoin per day assuming it would take me no longer than 25 days to find a block and if I found one earlier then that then obviously I had come out ahead and I would pick a different address to solo mine to. It had to work, how couldn't it. At other times I would rent enough hashpower that I should have found a block within 12 hours.\nWell it was quiet a roller coaster. From April of 2015 until mid December of 2015 I would estimate I found at least ten blocks probably more.\nBut I never could get back to where i started. I would get to the point where I was about to lose it all then I'd find a block.\nThen I'd use that one to try and find more. When I was about to lose it all again, I'd find another one.\nThis process of losing almost everything and then gaining back a little, rinse wash and repeat continued for 8 months.\nIt was the most stressful time of my life.\nAll I could think about was getting back what I had lost so I wouldn't have to tell my fiance what I had done.\nShe felt neglected because I was always swiping my phone to see my new \"best share\" and to see how close I was to finding another block and a dark cloud followed me everywhere I went.\nMy negativity and despair showed on my face and she didn't understand why because I couldn't be honest about what I was doing because I was so ashamed.\nEvery day she would complain how I was always on my phone and not paying any attention to her, and I wanted so bad to just get back what I had lost and give her the attention she wanted and needed.\nLong story short. She left me and I lost it all.\nThe moral of my story is dont let bitcoin take ahold of you like it did me, relationships are what matter and once you lose them you can't get them back.\nShe's already moved on and found a man that is giving her the attention she needs and I'm lonely, broken hearted and in more debt than I've ever been in, in my life.\na very valuable experience, thank you for sharing stories like this, I'm sure one day your story will awaken and inspire others.

Furthermore, you could theoretically write a program which searches through every single private key possible (it isn't that hard, it is just a big integer and you go sequentially) but the odds of finding a key that corresponds to an address with Bitcoin in it is incredibly low. While doable, it would take an ungodly amount of time to do, on the scale of trillions (or more) of years.

Until April 2015 when my miners that I used for solo mining actually found a block.\nIt was my first time finding one after over a year of trying and seeing 25 coins in my wallet worth almost $6,000.00 was so exhilarating and I felt like I was on cloud 9\nI told my fiance about it and for the first time she was happy i had gotten involved into mining bitcoin.\nI made a promise never to touch them until we we ready to retire.\nA few days later I purchased 1 bitcoin and rented some hashpower and tried my luck at solo mining again.\nBefore I had spent even 1/4 of that bitcoin I found another block.\nWoo hoo! This is easy I told myself.\nOf course I told her about it and again she was very pleased.\nThis time I promised I would only use five coins to try and solo mine another block.\nWell I lost the five.\nThen more, then more and more and more until I had lost it all.\nI couldn't tell her what I had done, couldn't admit that I had turned into a compulsive gambler and threw it all away.\nSo what did I decide to do?\nI took out a home equity loan and borrowed $30,000.00 so I could purchase about 75 coins at the time.\nI just knewI had figured out a system and with that many coins I would be able to get back what I had lost and repay my home equity loan.\nSo from April 2015 until mid December 2015 I tried every method I could come up with to try and outsmart the system.\nAt times I would spend an average of 1 bitcoin per day assuming it would take me no longer than 25 days to find a block and if I found one earlier then that then obviously I had come out ahead and I would pick a different address to solo mine to.

Don't start investigating every potential way to score easy bitcoin because this is what leads to unhealthy greed and consequentially, to bad decisions. Don't trade, mine, gamble, just keep it honest and if you have a long range, positive outlook for bitcoin then everything will fall into play in due time. However, since the price of coins is on the rise, every .1 that you can grab for yourself and save will be a plus for you down the road. That's why trading the unknown is troublesome, unless you already have a stash and you're just playing w/ loot from your checking account.\nIn essence, getting into bitcoin leads one to read as much as possible about the whole ecosystem and the wanting to grab more coinage in any way possible w/o understanding and/or respecting the risks. At some point, those that haven't saved up and are chomping at the bit to get more coinage are desperate to try less trusted means of acquiring and the result could end in the same way as the OP. The sad thing is none of this will change as each subsequent subset of people will learn about and get into bitcoin at different price ranges and then will have undergone different seasons in the bitcoin world which will have tested their nerves in different ways but if one can keep on buying more coins and saving them w/o the urge to gamble, they'll be fine as the coin matures into what they assumed it was going to be once they decided to buy in in the first place. Most of us have made mistakes because of the learning curve and if I could do it over again (which I don't wish to), I would've just saved every last coin I ever bought.\n", "author": "Chef Ramsay Legendary Offline Activity: 1568 Merit: 1000 "}, {"date": "2015-12-19 19:16:26", "content": "A sad story, but you can't blame bitcoin for what happened to you.

Until April 2015 when my miners that I used for solo mining actually found a block.\nIt was my first time finding one after over a year of trying and seeing 25 coins in my wallet worth almost $6,000.00 was so exhilarating and I felt like I was on cloud 9\nI told my fiance about it and for the first time she was happy i had gotten involved into mining bitcoin.\nI made a promise never to touch them until we we ready to retire.\nA few days later I purchased 1 bitcoin and rented some hashpower and tried my luck at solo mining again.\nBefore I had spent even 1/4 of that bitcoin I found another block.\nWoo hoo! This is easy I told myself.\nOf course I told her about it and again she was very pleased.\nThis time I promised I would only use five coins to try and solo mine another block.\nWell I lost the five.\nThen more, then more and more and more until I had lost it all.\nI couldn't tell her what I had done, couldn't admit that I had turned into a compulsive gambler and threw it all away.\nSo what did I decide to do?\nI took out a home equity loan and borrowed $30,000.00 so I could purchase about 75 coins at the time.\nI just knewI had figured out a system and with that many coins I would be able to get back what I had lost and repay my home equity loan.\nSo from April 2015 until mid December 2015 I tried every method I could come up with to try and outsmart the system.\nAt times I would spend an average of 1 bitcoin per day assuming it would take me no longer than 25 days to find a block and if I found one earlier then that then obviously I had come out ahead and I would pick a different address to solo mine to. It had to work, how couldn't it. At other times I would rent enough hashpower that I should have found a block within 12 hours.\nWell it was quiet a roller coaster. From April of 2015 until mid December of 2015 I would estimate I found at least ten blocks probably more.\nBut I never could get back to where i started. I would get to the point where I was about to lose it all then I'd find a block.\nThen I'd use that one to try and find more. When I was about to lose it all again, I'd find another one.\nThis process of losing almost everything and then gaining back a little, rinse wash and repeat continued for 8 months.\nIt was the most stressful time of my life.\nAll I could think about was getting back what I had lost so I wouldn't have to tell my fiance what I had done.\nShe felt neglected because I was always swiping my phone to see my new \"best share\" and to see how close I was to finding another block and a dark cloud followed me everywhere I went.\nMy negativity and despair showed on my face and she didn't understand why because I couldn't be honest about what I was doing because I was so ashamed.\nEvery day she would complain how I was always on my phone and not paying any attention to her, and I wanted so bad to just get back what I had lost and give her the attention she wanted and needed.\nLong story short. She left me and I lost it all.\nThe moral of my story is dont let bitcoin take ahold of you like it did me, relationships are what matter and once you lose them you can't get them back.\nShe's already moved on and found a man that is giving her the attention she needs and I'm lonely, broken hearted and in more debt than I've ever been in, in my life.\nsorry to hear about your problems man but bitcoin isnt the problem its you, you r a gambler, if it hadnt been bitcoin then it probably would have been something else..... name your vice.  again sorry to hear but you need to get some help with dealing with your compulsive nature.\nall the best\n", "author": "calkob Hero Member Offline Activity: 714 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-12-19 19:43:50", "content": "Ambitious is what made you lost both things,you made wrong choises,being marryed you must be clear ,is the same to have another woman soon or later your wife will catch.I had thinked before ,sometime ago request a loan to play bitcoins todays i would be smiling and would had repay the loan since bitcoin last months is getting more value,but i have a family that is more important then my ambitious ,soo i had choose family ,later i can give a try but must be shared since you are playing with savings from both not only you anymore.\n", "author": "knowhow Hero Member Offline Activity: 560 Merit: 500 "}, {"date": "2015-12-19 20:43:34", "content": "SFYL, OP.
